[0.00 → 0.74] You know how it goes.
[3.98 → 5.36] Why can't I hear you?
[5.76 → 6.36] Oh, um...
[10.66 → 12.36] Am I...
[12.36 → 12.62] Oh.
[13.84 → 14.64] Because I'm stupid.
[19.26 → 20.20] Anyway, sorry.
[20.40 → 22.68] We should just do one time zone in the US.
[22.96 → 23.88] Like Beijing time.
[25.36 → 26.82] Yeah, it should be Pacific time.
[27.56 → 28.38] You only have one time zone?
[28.70 → 29.38] Yeah, I think so.
[29.76 → 31.30] I mean, that would just make everything easier.
[31.58 → 33.58] I think they just do Beijing time.
[34.38 → 36.34] If I remember correctly.
[36.70 → 38.74] But everyone eats lunch at a different time, basically.
[38.82 → 39.72] Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
[39.72 → 43.82] I mean, you just know that 2 p.m. is lunchtime or whatever.
[44.48 → 44.96] It's not weird.
[45.04 → 47.58] Trash, you already don't eat dinner at the same time as everyone else.
[47.76 → 50.68] Adam's eating dinner at 4 p.m., brushing his teeth and going to bed.
[50.86 → 51.78] It doesn't matter.
[52.12 → 54.56] What time does Adam go to bed, actually?
[55.74 → 58.68] I don't know, but he brushes his teeth at 4.30 p.m.
[58.68 → 59.54] and he never eats.
[59.54 → 60.72] It's messed up.
[60.72 → 61.16] What?
[61.80 → 62.70] It's messed up.
[62.90 → 68.00] Not only that, it's like such a hurdle for him that once he brushes his teeth, he just
[68.00 → 69.00] refuses to eat anything.
[69.30 → 70.80] Yeah, you can't brush your teeth like that.
[70.80 → 71.78] Even vegan food.
[71.84 → 74.22] We were at a restaurant that had vegan options.
[74.30 → 75.52] And he's like, guys, I brushed my teeth.
[75.88 → 78.60] And we're like, you can do it again.
[78.60 → 81.70] It's not going to work out this time.
[82.36 → 84.62] Vegan donuts are way crazier than normal ones for some reason.
[85.08 → 85.46] Oh, hey.
[85.72 → 86.42] Hey, hi.
[86.54 → 86.98] Hey, hi.
[87.08 → 87.54] Hey, hi.
[88.26 → 88.68] Hello.
[89.20 → 91.84] Guys, we have an action-packed date today.
[92.34 → 95.12] And we have a new set of guests on today.
[95.84 → 97.22] And by a new set, I mean just Dax.
[97.58 → 101.54] Now, Dax has officially stated that he is better than trash.
[102.24 → 103.04] Is this true?
[103.98 → 105.78] We're going to have chat vote at the end.
[105.90 → 106.86] Dax has a good following.
[106.98 → 107.50] It's not fair.
[107.88 → 109.76] We're going to have chat vote who to vote off.
[110.00 → 110.32] Yes.
[110.40 → 112.06] And they're going to be permanently banned from the stand-up.
[112.28 → 112.78] It's true.
[112.94 → 115.52] So, Chad, at the end of this, we're going to do a poll.
[115.88 → 117.88] If you like Dax or trash.
[118.22 → 122.78] And whoever loses not only has to leave the stand-up.
[123.32 → 126.54] I'm going to go back through the previous YouTube videos and blur out their face.
[126.78 → 129.38] So, if trash loses, he's like he's gone forever.
[129.86 → 130.10] Okay?
[130.10 → 133.42] We're going to put a cancelled sticker on them for each one.
[133.60 → 133.86] Yep.
[134.48 → 134.76] Okay.
[135.10 → 136.22] Everybody ready to do this?
[136.28 → 138.94] So, we have a spicy one today.
[139.14 → 143.28] And I just wanted to start off with what I consider the greatest thing that I've ever seen in my lifetime.
[143.80 → 147.72] Which is, there is a new URL browser.
[147.88 → 149.58] But before I guess, oh, I should do an intro, right?
[149.74 → 150.34] Hey, everybody.
[150.46 → 152.04] This is the stand-up.
[152.18 → 152.30] Guess what?
[152.30 → 153.56] I thought we already did the intro.
[153.56 → 155.00] Dude, we did not do it properly.
[155.00 → 156.78] This is the stand-up we have with us.
[156.88 → 159.24] Dax, TJ, and Trash Dev.
[159.48 → 163.66] At the end of this, we're going to determine who actually has to leave the stand-up permanently.
[163.86 → 165.52] Whether it be Trash or Dax.
[165.88 → 167.86] But, before we begin, I want...
[167.86 → 168.66] Or actually, now that we can't begin...
[168.66 → 170.60] I can't tell if this is a joke, and it's stressing me out.
[171.52 → 172.36] It's not a joke.
[172.42 → 173.02] It's 100% real.
[173.04 → 175.22] There's no way you didn't already do the intro, though.
[175.38 → 176.72] Okay, maybe I already did the intro.
[177.08 → 177.76] I could remember.
[177.76 → 178.12] Josh, leave it in.
[178.12 → 179.04] Okay, hey, take it out.
[179.10 → 179.56] Take it out.
[179.96 → 180.54] Leave it in.
[180.60 → 181.36] Josh, take it out.
[181.36 → 185.64] All right, so I was going to say we're going to talk about URLs, but we're going to actually start with the better one.
[185.74 → 186.82] Are you ready for this, Dax?
[187.70 → 187.94] Oh, yeah.
[187.94 → 190.62] I want to hear your opinion right away on this.
[191.52 → 193.90] Okay, this is the most important part of it all.
[193.98 → 200.40] You may not be able to see this unless if you're in on the stream, but Elizabeth Holmes' partner has a new blood testing startup.
[200.52 → 201.12] That's right.
[201.66 → 209.32] Elizabeth, who has been known for scamming medical stuff based on blood startups, has now officially started another blood startup.
[209.46 → 210.48] Are you ready for this?
[210.48 → 211.78] Is this going to actually happen?
[211.90 → 219.58] Has tech reached its pinnacle ridiculousness that if you start an AI company, and it doesn't matter who you are, you get millions of dollars of funding?
[220.74 → 223.24] I think this is a great idea off the bat.
[223.46 → 224.20] That's what I'm going to say.
[224.62 → 225.22] Okay, look.
[226.28 → 229.08] Who in the world has thought about blood testing more?
[230.22 → 231.00] Probably her.
[231.20 → 231.84] And she's like in jail.
[231.84 → 232.70] The people that put her in jail.
[232.72 → 233.56] Yeah, she's in jail, right?
[234.08 → 236.36] I'm saying she knows everything she's done wrong.
[236.36 → 240.44] I'm sure every day of her life she was probably like, if only I did this one thing different.
[240.58 → 242.12] The one thing being not the fraud.
[242.98 → 245.24] She probably has learned her lesson, right?
[245.38 → 246.64] It was a big lesson.
[246.96 → 247.40] Yeah, what, Prime?
[247.40 → 249.06] You don't believe in second chances, dude?
[249.08 → 249.30] Yeah.
[249.30 → 251.76] Oh, from meth to Netflix, guy.
[251.94 → 252.34] Really?
[252.46 → 253.58] He doesn't believe in second chances.
[253.92 → 263.46] So what I don't know is I don't know the recidivism rate on scamming people when it comes to blood testing or when it comes to medical testing magic software.
[263.64 → 266.30] So I don't know if it's 100% or zero.
[266.30 → 269.58] It's going to be 100% if you don't support this is the point here.
[269.58 → 273.68] Yeah, Prime, jail's for rehabilitation, dude.
[273.78 → 274.08] Come on.
[274.26 → 277.62] Let her rehabilitate herself and put herself back in a good spot, okay?
[277.68 → 279.66] Look, what's the chance she's going to do it again?
[280.10 → 284.24] Okay, I feel like none of you have the chances she's going to do it again.
[284.50 → 285.54] But how do you do this in jail?
[285.64 → 286.38] That's my question.
[286.52 → 287.10] I don't get it.
[287.28 → 289.04] They have cell phones tracked.
[289.34 → 290.30] You can call.
[290.68 → 294.28] But don't founder, like, aren't they 24-7 on?
[294.52 → 295.40] Doesn't she have like five minutes?
[295.40 → 298.66] It's her partner's thing, but I'm sure they're talking about it.
[298.66 → 303.12] This is what none of us are saying right now, which is how do you feel being that Evan fellow?
[303.20 → 303.92] I think that's his name.
[304.14 → 309.50] Where even your company is described as Elizabeth Holmes' partner and not him.
[310.02 → 312.20] Just getting wrecked out there.
[312.20 → 313.50] Dude, that's how I feel about Terminal.
[313.64 → 315.98] It's always Prime's coffee company.
[317.62 → 318.80] That's such a good point.
[319.02 → 320.24] All right, let's get the point of view then.
[320.30 → 321.94] It sounds like Dax has something to say.
[321.94 → 327.56] So this is why Dax is actually bitter about this whole situation and supporting it.
[327.56 → 328.94] That would all make sense.
[329.94 → 332.70] He just wants Elizabeth Holmes to have a second chance, TJ.
[332.88 → 333.42] That's all.
[333.54 → 335.60] I'd say it has nothing to do with something else.
[336.16 → 340.50] I'm just saying it's only a – I feel like it's a win-win scenario, right?
[340.84 → 348.24] She either has learned from the situation, and she does the best company of all time, or she scams again, which would just be so funny.
[349.54 → 350.86] Not financial advice.
[350.94 → 352.22] I'm just going to support this.
[352.50 → 353.92] I'm just here for the content.
[353.92 → 357.26] Either the comeback story of a lifetime or the scam of a lifetime.
[357.26 → 358.16] It would be so good.
[359.48 → 361.94] What country does she have to move to if she does do this, though?
[362.60 → 367.66] Like, is there, like, a place you can move to that after you scam for a second time, you don't end up?
[367.66 → 369.34] I'm pretty sure that's called double jeopardy.
[369.38 → 370.78] She can't go back to jail for it.
[371.06 → 371.60] Yeah, you're right.
[371.96 → 373.06] That's legally correct.
[373.48 → 376.12] I thought everyone just goes to Russia or something when they do something wrong.
[376.78 → 377.70] Is that your plan?
[378.38 → 381.62] Isn't that what, like, I don't know, all the cyberterrorists do?
[381.66 → 382.18] I have no idea.
[382.72 → 386.84] I guess Snowden – Snowden's a type of different situation, but I guess he went to Russia.
[387.74 → 389.78] I love trash.
[389.90 → 391.50] Is that what all the criminals do?
[391.56 → 392.18] Just go to Russia?
[392.76 → 393.58] That's what I'm saying.
[394.62 → 396.74] You're just talking about some movie that you watched.
[396.92 → 397.54] Like, is this real life?
[397.60 → 399.44] I saw this in the Bourne Identity.
[399.44 → 405.18] I'm not actually sure if I'm referring real life or not, but I'm pretty sure someone has gone to Russia after they've done something bad.
[405.50 → 407.18] Mission Impossible 4 through 7, dude.
[407.26 → 407.94] Like, obviously.
[408.14 → 408.98] Have you not learned anything?
[411.68 → 412.04] Yeah.
[412.48 → 415.62] Is she banned from doing – because I know sometimes you get in trouble like this.
[415.64 → 416.80] You get banned from industries.
[417.62 → 419.16] How do you get banned from industries?
[419.26 → 420.26] Can you explain that to me?
[420.56 → 425.82] Like, how does an industry say, hey, you're not allowed to make medical startups?
[425.82 → 429.00] It doesn't happen if you have, like, a professional license kind of situation.
[429.00 → 430.36] It might be something like that.
[430.66 → 431.68] Like getting disbarred.
[432.00 → 432.16] Yeah.
[432.22 → 436.16] When people get in trouble with the SEC, like, who is – I forgot the guy's name.
[436.26 → 437.30] He's super rich.
[437.38 → 438.06] He got in trouble with the SEC.
[438.06 → 438.64] Bernie Madoff.
[439.22 → 439.96] No, not that guy.
[440.06 → 440.94] It's a different guy.
[441.30 → 444.42] And they banned him from, like, managing other people's money.
[444.88 → 448.20] But he's so rich that he just manages his own money now, and he still does the same thing.
[449.16 → 449.56] Epstein.
[451.56 → 452.02] That's awesome.
[452.02 → 453.14] I don't think it was Epstein.
[453.30 → 453.58] Okay.
[453.70 → 453.90] Okay.
[453.96 → 454.28] Just checking.
[454.28 → 455.72] Someone is vacuuming right now.
[455.82 → 456.26] Yeah.
[457.26 → 458.88] Who is vacuuming?
[459.20 → 461.28] This is a stand-up, okay, people?
[462.34 → 463.36] Dax, is that –
[463.36 → 464.52] Leave it in.
[464.62 → 465.30] Leave it in.
[465.50 → 466.02] Leave it in.
[466.04 → 466.88] I want to hear that, dude.
[467.04 → 467.66] Anyway, okay.
[467.80 → 468.92] We can move on.
[470.00 → 471.76] Dax, what do you think about this?
[473.04 → 474.04] I just want you to look at it.
[474.04 → 474.70] I can't see.
[474.82 → 475.44] It's all blurry.
[475.78 → 477.12] It's the URL thing.
[477.56 → 478.66] It's the URL thing.
[479.22 → 479.94] There's a new thing.
[480.00 → 480.58] A new browser.
[480.58 → 485.78] The modern browser states that browsers should stop putting
[485.78 → 487.74] in the dates and the full URL.
[487.92 → 490.02] It should display it beautifully.
[491.16 → 493.12] Whereas there are spaces in between the slashes.
[493.24 → 494.82] There are spaces in between the words.
[495.20 → 496.34] It URL decodes.
[496.46 → 497.14] It's fantastic.
[497.34 → 500.52] It can even live through vacuuming sounds in the background.
[500.74 → 502.02] It is, like, amazing.
[502.26 → 502.84] It's so good.
[502.84 → 505.04] Close your door.
[505.26 → 506.14] I'm going to get voted off.
[506.46 → 507.20] It's closed.
[507.40 → 508.16] That's what's crazy.
[511.16 → 514.02] The worst part is trash is still going to get voted off.
[516.90 → 517.98] Guys, please don't.
[517.98 → 519.30] Can we just tie it at the lead?
[519.30 → 521.22] It's going to lead to a vacuum cleaner.
[522.16 → 522.98] You know, that's fair.
[523.10 → 525.30] That's actually, like, you know, kind of makes sense.
[525.30 → 527.24] That's trash's normal expected behaviour.
[527.36 → 530.22] It's like, yeah, I lost to the vacuum cleaner again.
[530.22 → 531.44] It makes sense.
[531.44 → 532.20] This isn't the first time.
[532.50 → 533.16] On paper, it makes sense.
[533.16 → 534.46] Okay, Dax, give us your opinion.
[534.58 → 535.94] We'll take out the vacuum in post.
[537.90 → 541.80] My issue with this is I don't think they're, well, one, I don't like them messing with
[541.80 → 542.12] the URL.
[542.28 → 544.62] But also, I don't think what they did looks better.
[545.12 → 545.80] It looks worse.
[547.46 → 548.42] Are you guys just laughing at the vacuum?
[548.88 → 551.70] I'm laughing because we can't hear it until you talk.
[551.70 → 556.06] And then your attack and your release allows the vacuum to come in again.
[556.16 → 557.40] I'm going to tell them to.
[557.78 → 558.58] I'll be back in a second.
[558.58 → 560.58] Oh, you got your, it's your cleaners.
[560.70 → 560.98] Okay.
[561.16 → 561.90] Got it.
[562.02 → 563.94] But Dax is Silicon Valley stuff.
[564.18 → 565.66] Dude, that's a real startup there.
[567.08 → 567.90] That's a founder.
[568.06 → 568.58] That's a founder.
[569.04 → 569.80] It's founder mode.
[570.00 → 570.40] Engage.
[570.60 → 571.62] You hear Dax turn around.
[571.82 → 572.60] Keep it down.
[572.90 → 573.64] Keep it down.
[574.76 → 576.64] They're listening to the standup anyway.
[576.86 → 579.30] So they heard you say you're going to tell them to stop.
[579.36 → 580.00] So they stopped.
[580.08 → 580.70] It's everywhere.
[580.98 → 581.76] It's everywhere right now.
[582.06 → 583.48] Like, oh, we're bothering Mr. Dax.
[583.48 → 584.46] We have to be quiet.
[586.54 → 588.78] You may need more than make so cold.
[590.50 → 591.92] It's founder Dax.
[592.12 → 592.54] Sorry, Dax.
[592.58 → 593.26] Okay, okay, okay.
[593.64 → 594.02] We got to go.
[594.14 → 594.42] All right.
[594.42 → 596.36] So I have a real statement on this one.
[596.42 → 596.86] So do I.
[596.86 → 604.34] Which is the liability of trying to make your own pretty URL printer is just insane.
[604.50 → 612.62] Like, think about how many engineering hours are going to be sunk into the fact that nobody has, like, a standard format in which they do URLs.
[613.14 → 614.46] And you're just going to, like, drop.
[614.62 → 619.20] And, like, if someone names an article 2025, it will probably be dropped because they'll be like, ah, that's a date.
[619.26 → 620.32] We don't display dates.
[620.52 → 621.94] And it's just, like, slash.
[622.14 → 624.08] And you're just like, what the heck's going on?
[624.36 → 626.78] Why would you ever want to implement this?
[627.12 → 629.30] This just seems like a disaster from the beginning.
[629.82 → 630.84] Is it AI powered?
[633.04 → 633.96] Is it 2025?
[635.16 → 635.48] Okay.
[636.04 → 637.90] How else do you raise money, Dax?
[638.60 → 639.92] Like, what are you talking about?
[639.98 → 641.32] I have an actual statement.
[641.68 → 642.10] I have an actual statement.
[642.10 → 643.20] Okay, Trash, let's hear yours.
[643.54 → 644.14] Let's move on.
[644.22 → 650.30] As soon as I saw this, I was really worried about my parents because I think they're, like, kind of smart enough to tell when URLs look kind of fishy.
[650.30 → 651.88] Like, when they're, like, super long and ugly.
[652.50 → 659.00] But, like, if someone, like, prettifies that, I mean, like, I'm not sure, like, if they can prettify, like, you know, I don't know.
[659.22 → 661.60] But, like, if it looks good, my parents are going to click it.
[661.68 → 664.88] So I'm kind of, like, worried about that scenario where it just looks good.
[664.92 → 668.14] And they're like, oh, like, it can't be fake because, look, it looks pretty.
[668.14 → 670.08] So that's, like, my initial reaction to that.
[670.16 → 670.78] But I don't know.
[671.32 → 673.28] Do your parents like using experimental browsers?
[674.60 → 677.96] I'm pretty sure my parents will use anything if you give it to them.
[678.14 → 679.36] And that's my concern.
[680.62 → 683.12] My dad will, like, text me every day, what's my password?
[683.38 → 684.44] Which is kind of ironic.
[684.74 → 685.90] And, like, why would I know that?
[687.18 → 690.48] But it's just, like, or he's, like, I can't.
[690.48 → 691.60] Does he also only use one?
[692.30 → 694.82] I'm not going to answer that for their sake.
[694.82 → 701.64] So Trash has multiple passwords memorized, but they're different people.
[701.86 → 705.16] I love that Trash is actually embodying one password as well.
[705.50 → 707.62] He is somebody else's password manager.
[708.54 → 711.72] Well, my parents aren't going to remember it, so I got to help them, okay?
[712.02 → 714.26] There's a long heritage of this in the Trash family.
[715.02 → 716.18] See, it's not my fault.
[716.22 → 717.02] It's my parents' fault.
[717.06 → 718.10] I was raised like this.
[718.74 → 720.22] That is so dang good.
[720.22 → 724.18] But I just, I think Dax makes a perfect point,
[724.18 → 727.70] which is that your parents aren't going to use that experimental browser.
[729.78 → 730.30] That's it.
[730.76 → 731.70] Never say never.
[732.26 → 733.02] I'll tweet about it.
[733.12 → 735.50] I would be more worried about receiving a text message,
[735.60 → 738.64] letting them know their UPS package is late and that they need to pay a fee.
[738.92 → 741.42] That would probably be a much better, like, scam.
[741.94 → 742.86] Dude, I almost fell for that.
[742.96 → 744.16] I almost fell for that.
[744.24 → 745.20] I did fall for that.
[746.58 → 748.02] I've never fallen for that.
[749.36 → 752.28] Like, as part of the stand-up, hey, everybody, here's my kid.
[752.28 → 754.28] I'll be right back.
[755.92 → 757.82] It's an authentic stand-up experience.
[757.96 → 759.12] I thought that was like an...
[759.12 → 761.14] You thought that was just like an animation?
[761.14 → 763.50] I thought it was an animation, and I was like...
[763.50 → 766.48] I looked at it, and I was like, whoa, that's crazy.
[766.64 → 767.90] And I was like, oh, is that a real person?
[768.06 → 769.22] Is this how this usually goes?
[769.70 → 771.30] Dude, we're about to get in so much trouble.
[771.38 → 772.74] Prime's breaking child labour laws.
[772.84 → 773.74] Kids at the stand-up.
[773.74 → 774.40] At the startup.
[774.98 → 776.12] We got vacuuming.
[776.22 → 777.96] We got kids in the background.
[778.30 → 779.24] I don't know what's happening.
[779.24 → 780.52] That was crazy.
[780.78 → 783.52] The animations for your backgrounds are wild right now, Prime.
[783.72 → 785.14] AI-powered child.
[785.88 → 788.92] Yeah, how did you get that kid to show up in your background like that?
[789.24 → 789.64] AI.
[790.06 → 790.82] It's always AI.
[791.32 → 792.28] Every single time.
[792.88 → 794.76] Okay, I'm just going to throw it out there.
[794.82 → 796.68] I hate it, the URL thing.
[797.52 → 802.22] But, like, armies are going to get tricked by, like, subdomains.
[802.22 → 807.18] They get tricked by, like, the by URLs being long and, like, looking different.
[807.50 → 812.02] And, like, is it not, like, highlighting what the actual domain is?
[812.30 → 812.44] Right?
[812.46 → 814.60] So you see, like, oh, it's actually Google.
[814.78 → 816.44] It's not Google.
[817.40 → 818.56] My Super Secrets Game.
[818.64 → 820.24] Dot com slash other stuff.
[820.30 → 820.44] Right?
[820.52 → 823.90] Like, it, armies don't know anything about URLs.
[824.12 → 826.32] I hate that we would hide URLs from people.
[826.64 → 826.90] Right?
[826.90 → 830.82] Like, I think it's bad because I think it's going to, like, destroy the internet, maybe.
[831.28 → 837.96] But for armies, it actually seems like they don't know how to read URLs anyway, and they get tricked.
[838.22 → 840.96] And everybody uses social engineering to get them tricked with that.
[841.34 → 841.76] I don't know.
[843.14 → 844.00] Yeah, that's a good point.
[844.08 → 847.06] Maybe this ends up being harder to scan people with.
[847.48 → 848.38] I just don't like the way it looks.
[848.42 → 849.12] I think it looks weird.
[849.54 → 850.64] Yeah, well, it's also kind of ugly.
[850.84 → 851.36] I'm with you.
[851.46 → 853.20] Like, the slash and, like, the spaces.
[853.36 → 853.66] I don't know.
[853.76 → 855.20] Maybe I'm just used to looking at normal URLs.
[855.20 → 857.08] But I just, they're like, it looks so much better.
[857.84 → 858.66] But I don't think it looks better.
[859.30 → 863.40] I mean, it's like a common human reaction to, like, react to something you're not used to negatively, right?
[863.64 → 864.90] So, maybe we all activate.
[865.00 → 865.60] Shut up, Trash!
[866.18 → 866.54] What?
[866.60 → 868.16] If anybody say that, and I hate it.
[868.44 → 868.78] What?
[869.32 → 872.12] Not Trash or just yank in your chain.
[872.14 → 873.86] He was doing the thing that you were talking about.
[874.12 → 874.36] Yeah.
[874.84 → 875.22] Mm-hmm.
[876.38 → 877.26] He doesn't get it.
[877.32 → 878.04] He still doesn't get it.
[878.04 → 878.64] He doesn't get it.
[878.84 → 880.16] I literally don't get it.
[880.16 → 884.10] You said people don't like it when they get exposed to something new.
[884.10 → 886.66] And then we all said, like, oh, that's a terrible idea.
[886.84 → 888.08] I've never heard anyone say that.
[888.50 → 888.68] Oh.
[888.76 → 889.74] See how that's the same thing?
[889.74 → 890.08] Yes.
[890.30 → 890.44] Yes.
[890.44 → 891.02] That you're saying.
[891.14 → 891.60] There you go.
[891.70 → 891.94] Okay, got it.
[891.94 → 892.88] It's not as funny now.
[893.04 → 893.98] Yeah, it's not funny anymore.
[894.32 → 895.44] You have to explain it.
[895.54 → 895.96] It's not funny.
[896.16 → 897.12] I still don't think he gets it.
[897.36 → 898.04] I get it.
[898.04 → 899.00] I get it.
[899.16 → 900.52] And I'm not going to explain it.
[900.76 → 902.04] I'm not going to explain it back.
[903.08 → 904.90] First off, it's 9 a.m. my time.
[904.98 → 905.16] Okay?
[905.20 → 906.48] I haven't had my coffee yet, either.
[906.54 → 906.74] Yeah.
[906.74 → 908.60] For break of day, 9 a.m.
[908.60 → 912.28] You know what?
[912.80 → 914.98] Day in the life of a Netflix engineer.
[915.68 → 917.28] Wake up at 10 a.m.
[917.52 → 918.94] Check my Slack messages.
[919.26 → 920.58] Oops, hopped out a podcast.
[921.10 → 922.16] Wow, it's noon.
[922.34 → 925.40] Better head down to get some lunch from the local Phil's Coffee.
[927.78 → 928.92] And that's true.
[929.62 → 930.20] Yeah, actually.
[932.40 → 933.96] Trash about to crash the economy.
[934.32 → 936.52] Day in the life of an engineer video.
[936.52 → 939.78] If you make that, you realize how many engineers lose their job trash.
[939.88 → 941.34] Like, you've got to stop this right now.
[943.76 → 945.10] I'm the beacon of hope.
[945.40 → 945.64] Okay?
[945.74 → 946.02] That's all.
[948.12 → 950.36] I don't know how, but I'll agree with you.
[950.42 → 950.66] All right.
[950.68 → 951.64] We've got to stop this crap.
[951.80 → 952.04] All right.
[952.12 → 953.00] Hey, Dax.
[953.38 → 953.78] Dax.
[954.04 → 955.60] You keep going back to me, man.
[955.84 → 956.30] I don't know how many takes that.
[956.30 → 958.66] Well, that's because you have all the opinions on this matter.
[958.80 → 960.32] I'm just going to show you a photo.
[960.32 → 961.20] Oh, okay.
[961.32 → 961.60] Yes.
[961.82 → 962.62] Brian Chesky.
[963.30 → 965.56] I've been complaining about this man for years now.
[965.56 → 968.02] And it's really unfair because I just hate the way he looks.
[969.14 → 970.80] Well, first, who's Brian Chesky?
[970.98 → 972.00] He's the founder of Airbnb.
[972.54 → 972.76] Okay.
[972.84 → 973.88] I'm going to go on a little bit of a rant.
[974.36 → 974.58] Okay.
[974.62 → 974.98] A little bit.
[975.02 → 975.36] A little bit.
[976.26 → 977.14] I know it's unfair.
[977.30 → 978.88] Can I preface this?
[979.22 → 979.58] No.
[979.78 → 980.76] Just so there's like a reason.
[980.90 → 985.62] Hey, Airbnb is doing a huge change in their platform, and they're now doing experiences and
[985.62 → 986.10] other stuff.
[986.20 → 986.46] Okay.
[986.56 → 987.04] Dax, go.
[987.14 → 989.30] How do you feel about Airbnb changing their business model?
[989.30 → 990.28] I hate his face.
[990.28 → 997.68] Anyway, I've always found him because he's always giving talks and stuff and I always
[997.68 → 998.64] have trouble watching them.
[999.04 → 999.70] But he did one.
[999.78 → 1002.24] I think it was the one that made founder mode go viral.
[1003.44 → 1003.78] And if you watch.
[1003.78 → 1004.68] Oh, then I love him.
[1005.58 → 1006.82] Is he actually responsible?
[1007.66 → 1009.14] If you watch his interview, he's always.
[1009.32 → 1010.44] The whole interview is going like this.
[1012.94 → 1013.92] That's called cocaine.
[1014.38 → 1014.66] Yeah.
[1014.70 → 1015.94] I'm like, I've seen that before.
[1016.00 → 1017.02] I think I know what that is.
[1017.02 → 1018.46] While Dax is watching them.
[1020.48 → 1021.64] I'm doing that also.
[1024.44 → 1026.62] So I'm like, he's definitely on a crazy amount of cocaine.
[1027.08 → 1029.52] And then I saw this quote from him yesterday.
[1029.68 → 1030.94] It's going to take me a second to find it.
[1031.12 → 1033.94] But hang on.
[1034.48 → 1038.00] I made him delete it because I wanted to get your raw reaction to this prime.
[1038.20 → 1040.36] I was like, do not send this in the chat right now.
[1040.42 → 1044.22] I want to get prime's raw reaction to this moment.
[1045.02 → 1046.56] I'm very excited about this.
[1047.02 → 1050.32] Let's all stare at Dax until he finds his quote.
[1051.32 → 1052.42] Classic stand-up.
[1052.52 → 1053.24] Here we go.
[1053.52 → 1057.00] He goes, I was basically going from room to room.
[1057.16 → 1060.16] Just pouring out of this stream of consciousness manifesto.
[1060.28 → 1062.36] Like Jack Kerouac writing on the road.
[1062.64 → 1065.14] I basically said, we're not just a vacation app.
[1065.24 → 1066.42] We're going to be a platform.
[1066.54 → 1067.00] A community.
[1068.16 → 1072.56] And I'm just like, there's no way this just isn't cocaine.
[1072.66 → 1074.38] Like, is that just an explanation to all of this?
[1074.38 → 1075.76] The whole founder mode thing.
[1075.94 → 1077.96] Like, is that all kind of boiled down to?
[1079.30 → 1079.94] Drug use?
[1080.20 → 1080.44] Yeah.
[1080.70 → 1080.88] Yeah.
[1081.16 → 1082.18] Dax, you're a founder too.
[1082.26 → 1082.92] You should know this.
[1082.98 → 1084.56] You live in Miami, and you're a founder too.
[1084.72 → 1086.64] Like, this is standard founder behaviour.
[1086.64 → 1088.64] Yeah, it's normal.
[1088.86 → 1098.00] I think what actually ends up really happening is that people complain that they can't focus because they only can, you know, like read or write emails for 10 hours a day, 11 hours a day.
[1098.22 → 1104.26] These founders, so they use ADHD medication, commonly referred to as amphetamines, to pump themselves up even further.
[1104.26 → 1109.42] So they just walk around in this heightened state of just super intenseness for like 18 hours a day.
[1109.70 → 1112.42] I think this is actually just completely par for the course at this point.
[1113.00 → 1113.40] Yeah.
[1114.04 → 1114.30] Yeah.
[1114.72 → 1116.80] I have like a more reasonable take on the whole thing.
[1117.06 → 1117.18] Okay.
[1117.26 → 1117.70] Please.
[1117.82 → 1118.24] Thank you.
[1118.32 → 1119.60] That would be so helpful.
[1119.80 → 1121.94] I did not know where to take it after that.
[1122.18 → 1122.58] Dax.
[1122.72 → 1125.42] Dax's take was he's ugly, and he does cocaine.
[1126.00 → 1126.44] Okay.
[1126.56 → 1126.74] Okay.
[1126.78 → 1126.98] Okay.
[1127.16 → 1128.00] More reasonable.
[1128.12 → 1128.74] More reasonable.
[1128.94 → 1129.60] Thank you.
[1129.80 → 1130.58] More reasonable than that.
[1130.58 → 1139.88] Um, so I think what was interesting about how Airbnb started is they found this untapped supply that was pretty low overhead, right?
[1139.88 → 1148.08] I know Airbnb is pretty professionalized now, but once you get it set up, if someone comes and stays there for seven days, you're not doing seven days of work.
[1148.62 → 1154.96] Um, you know, that's obviously you have to hire people to clean and all that, but it's kind of, once you get it set up, it's kind of making you money pretty passively.
[1154.96 → 1161.88] Um, and that was like a huge amount of supply that just came on online through Airbnb.
[1162.08 → 1163.48] I mean, that's why it was so transformational.
[1163.90 → 1168.94] Uh, people realized this was a thing that they could do both on the supply and the demand side.
[1169.64 → 1176.18] And it seems so ridiculous at first because it felt like, yeah, why would people sleep on your pay to sleep on your couch?
[1176.18 → 1181.14] Um, so I can see how going through that made it feel like you just willed this thing to happen.
[1181.14 → 1183.14] And they, they, they did to a, to a huge degree.
[1183.82 → 1188.06] Um, but this experiences thing that they keep trying to launch, this isn't the first time they're launching this.
[1188.12 → 1191.42] I think they'd launched this like two years ago and they kind of shut it down.
[1191.50 → 1192.50] They kind of launched it again.
[1193.62 → 1195.68] It's so different from the rest of Airbnb.
[1195.74 → 1198.66] Cause like, it's not new supply.
[1198.80 → 1204.18] There's no one looking at this being like, oh, I'm going to suddenly offer experiences now because it's still a lot of work.
[1204.18 → 1206.84] Like you're still doing the work, and you're servicing people, et cetera.
[1207.30 → 1212.06] It's mostly just kind of existing businesses coming on, like just listing their stuff under there.
[1212.64 → 1219.92] Um, so where Airbnb initial thing was like this crazy growth opportunity, which I think it probably is tapering off now.
[1220.30 → 1222.14] Uh, and they're looking for like the next thing.
[1222.74 → 1228.06] I don't think this fits in that same format, and it feels very forced, and they've taken a few swings of this already.
[1228.38 → 1234.16] Um, I've looked through it a few times and I don't think I'm the customer for it, but I think a lot of people have felt,
[1234.18 → 1235.08] that way as well.
[1235.48 → 1236.24] So yeah, I don't know.
[1236.26 → 1236.90] I don't know where it's going.
[1237.40 → 1237.70] Yeah.
[1237.74 → 1243.10] I mean, I worked at a company called Schedulicity and their whole thing was to manage appointments for hairdressers,
[1243.10 → 1246.18] hairdressers, like physical therapists, all that.
[1246.22 → 1246.32] Yeah.
[1246.32 → 1248.32] There's like, there are a lot of companies that do this.
[1248.38 → 1253.48] This is not the first or second or third one open tables, yet another iteration on this exact same concept.
[1253.66 → 1255.28] And it just happens constantly.
[1255.64 → 1259.54] And so it's like, I'm not sure if they're really, I don't know how big the market is.
[1259.54 → 1262.32] Because I think what they're trying to solve is SEO, right?
[1262.72 → 1266.60] You go onto Google, you search hairdressers, whoever's really the top couple are going to win.
[1266.60 → 1273.26] So they're trying to make some sort of better place where people can peruse things and see things and have nice ratings and all that kind of stuff and be able to manage all their different appointments.
[1273.26 → 1275.98] I just am unsure if that market is really solvable.
[1276.12 → 1283.36] And then you have this whole entire other like orthogonal thing, which is going to be like plumbers or various kinds of maintenance that they're probably going to also be attempting to capture.
[1283.54 → 1290.22] But there are companies like Property Melt that, you know, that have these huge, that they already have these huge networks.
[1290.22 → 1301.98] And it's just like, how are you going, how are you going to change behaviour of property management companies that are using property management software and property this and property that to use Airbnb to manage their, you know, all their stuff?
[1301.98 → 1305.10] Like that's just like a it is a 10-year effort.
[1305.80 → 1308.20] There might be robots before they can nail this one.
[1308.86 → 1309.26] Right.
[1310.08 → 1310.36] Yeah.
[1310.48 → 1311.04] It's funny.
[1311.04 → 1319.00] Cause the company I work for, they originally wanted to do this and wanted to build a single app that, that you book paired appointments, whatever, any kind of any appointment based thing.
[1319.36 → 1322.16] And they realized it's impossible to build that network.
[1322.16 → 1326.88] So they ended up doing a completely different thing, which was building software to help these businesses operate.
[1327.52 → 1329.68] Um, and that's how SST was born.
[1330.56 → 1330.92] Yeah.
[1330.92 → 1332.56] It was mostly for hair salons.
[1332.60 → 1334.10] Cause that's a thing that I'm an expert in.
[1334.32 → 1337.12] So yeah, that makes you go to the barber more than any of us, dude.
[1337.18 → 1337.90] Stop pretending.
[1338.22 → 1339.10] You know how, you know what?
[1339.14 → 1340.78] It's, it's so messed up that that's true.
[1341.00 → 1341.80] It's literally true.
[1341.94 → 1342.68] It's by far true.
[1342.74 → 1344.80] I go like once every three months, max.
[1345.00 → 1346.20] My wife cuts my hair.
[1346.52 → 1346.98] Great clips.
[1347.34 → 1347.42] Okay.
[1347.80 → 1349.32] Liz shaves my head sometimes too.
[1349.46 → 1349.62] Yeah.
[1349.62 → 1350.58] My wife shaves my head too.
[1351.14 → 1352.16] A nice intimate moment.
[1353.36 → 1354.10] Dude, I do it.
[1354.18 → 1354.82] I do it myself.
[1355.42 → 1356.66] I shave my head myself.
[1356.88 → 1358.48] And then I take my glasses off when I do it.
[1358.48 → 1361.06] And I'm like completely blind, and I'm just like sitting in my garage.
[1361.16 → 1362.54] I'm sitting in my garage without a shirt.
[1362.60 → 1364.68] Just like, you know, rubbing a razor against my head.
[1364.68 → 1366.18] I'm like, I can't see anything.
[1366.38 → 1368.02] And then I, and then I go to like to get her.
[1368.10 → 1369.70] I'm like, wife, come here.
[1369.70 → 1370.30] I need help now.
[1370.32 → 1372.62] And then she comes in and just, but she just busts out laughing.
[1372.66 → 1374.16] Because I miss like so many spots.
[1374.16 → 1376.68] And I'm just like walking around with like a cheetah head.
[1376.72 → 1378.92] I'm just like, I don't know where the story's going.
[1378.92 → 1382.00] We're going to do an episode where you're doing that the whole time.
[1382.06 → 1382.80] I just want you to know.
[1383.08 → 1383.20] Yeah.
[1383.24 → 1385.14] I would like to see this, but hold on.
[1385.24 → 1388.48] So, uh, I, I'm booking something through Airbnb currently.
[1388.48 → 1390.12] I want to take my family, like Joshua tree.
[1390.38 → 1393.50] Apparently like the Milky Way is supposed to be perfect to see next weekend.
[1394.12 → 1396.12] And it's always there.
[1396.16 → 1396.56] Huh?
[1397.20 → 1398.26] It's like always there.
[1398.60 → 1399.44] The Milky Way is in town.
[1399.58 → 1401.46] No, it's based on the moon.
[1401.46 → 1403.72] Like if it's, if it's a full moon, you're not going to be able to see it.
[1403.80 → 1404.18] Right.
[1404.62 → 1406.78] But if there's no illumination, then you can see.
[1406.78 → 1407.98] Is that astrology trash?
[1409.46 → 1410.94] No, no, it's not.
[1411.60 → 1412.42] It is not.
[1413.12 → 1413.48] Okay.
[1414.16 → 1414.52] Okay.
[1414.80 → 1416.30] Don't get me started on the stars.
[1416.30 → 1416.68] All right.
[1416.68 → 1417.62] I'll talk about them.
[1418.76 → 1421.40] Oh, now I'm interested.
[1422.40 → 1423.28] I'm not going to open up.
[1423.28 → 1424.72] You're looking for Joshua tree.
[1424.82 → 1425.04] Go ahead.
[1425.10 → 1426.44] I'm looking for Joshua tree.
[1426.56 → 1428.52] And I thought the experience tab was nice.
[1428.72 → 1431.44] I didn't realize they had it before to Dax's comment earlier.
[1431.50 → 1432.04] Which I was surprised.
[1432.10 → 1434.46] I saw ratings and all these experiences.
[1434.46 → 1437.56] And I was like, Oh, I'm like, like how do they have all these ratings if they just launched?
[1437.80 → 1443.00] But anyway, like from a consumer's perspective, it actually like changed how I was looking at places.
[1443.14 → 1449.78] Because I started looking at other places, and I was basing on if I wanted to stay there based on the experiences I can do around it for the family.
[1450.24 → 1464.12] So I don't know if that's like maybe like another thing that could drive like more, you know, incentivization to like to have incentivized people to put going experiences on popular like areas to like, you know, when you book something, you don't just book a place.
[1464.12 → 1465.84] You always book something and then you do stuff.
[1465.96 → 1466.98] Like you don't just sit at your place.
[1467.40 → 1472.28] So I don't know if that's like something to kind of skew to like specifically like popular areas, kind of get a whole experience.
[1472.28 → 1477.76] But I did notice it changed how I like to use the Airbnb because usually I book, and then I like don't think about it.
[1477.80 → 1479.58] But now I was like, Oh, I want to plan a whole day.
[1479.58 → 1481.74] I want to do this and this and this.
[1481.84 → 1482.58] And I was like, Oh, cool.
[1482.62 → 1483.92] And it's all like one-stop shop.
[1485.12 → 1486.60] So personally, I do like it.
[1486.80 → 1488.44] Do I think it's going to actually transform their business?
[1488.74 → 1490.64] I don't, I don't think so.
[1491.86 → 1497.94] So yeah, I don't think it's actually going to, I don't, I don't see Airbnb like they need to do something else for sure.
[1498.02 → 1498.88] I just don't know what that is.
[1498.92 → 1502.38] But, but to like primus point, they're definitely like, this is the foundation of their platform.
[1502.38 → 1504.32] And then they're just going to like start adding different things.
[1504.32 → 1504.54] Right.
[1504.96 → 1505.24] So.
[1506.82 → 1507.18] Yeah.
[1507.34 → 1508.22] Why are you laughing?
[1509.58 → 1510.42] Everyone just said it.
[1510.44 → 1516.30] Every time I talk, I see everyone, every time I, I'm literally, I'm literally staring at my screen.
[1516.50 → 1518.02] I look at, I look at Siege.
[1518.20 → 1518.96] I look at Siege.
[1519.10 → 1520.24] And then I look at Prime.
[1520.44 → 1521.32] And I look at Dax.
[1521.46 → 1523.82] I see everyone slightly smiling.
[1524.30 → 1527.72] And I'm like, and I try, I try not to reach, hold on, hold on.
[1527.90 → 1528.98] I try not to read chat.
[1529.04 → 1530.10] Because I'm like, buy something in chat.
[1530.22 → 1531.64] Someone, someone's saying something in chat.
[1531.74 → 1536.18] But then I can't because I got to like to finish my thought, or I'm just going to completely fall apart.
[1536.32 → 1536.78] All right.
[1536.82 → 1537.54] Explain yourself.
[1537.54 → 1540.24] No, your thing was perfect.
[1540.36 → 1541.64] We can talk about that in a sec.
[1541.96 → 1542.96] What is happening?
[1542.96 → 1548.36] I just looked over at chat and someone said, Trash is a flat farther for sure.
[1549.82 → 1550.26] What?
[1551.26 → 1552.96] So out of nowhere.
[1552.96 → 1556.82] What does that have to do with anything?
[1556.82 → 1558.24] It's because you were talking about your moon theories.
[1558.38 → 1558.72] That's why.
[1560.14 → 1560.54] Yeah.
[1560.54 → 1561.44] Moon's fake, apparently.
[1561.44 → 1565.10] I just said I want to see the Milky Way on a dark sky.
[1565.38 → 1568.54] What I got from that is Trash is abandoning his family at Joshua Tree.
[1569.96 → 1570.94] I think that's a plan.
[1571.88 → 1572.50] Sorry, Trash.
[1572.58 → 1573.48] No, yours was reasonable.
[1573.62 → 1574.06] I apologize.
[1574.20 → 1575.46] That was Twitch chat 100%.
[1575.46 → 1585.06] I was like half like, but I was still, you know, when you drive and like you do all these crazy turns, you're like, man, I can't believe I just did those turns because I was thinking about something else completely.
[1585.94 → 1587.66] That's basically what was happening while I was talking.
[1587.74 → 1589.56] I was literally just staring at all three of you.
[1589.56 → 1593.40] And I was like, I need to finish my thought, but I need to know what's happening.
[1594.22 → 1596.18] I've never had a problem driving, Trash.
[1596.30 → 1597.06] I mean, the roads are designed to be pretty easy to navigate.
[1597.06 → 1599.60] I don't have a problem, but I don't remember.
[1599.78 → 1601.38] Like, I'll just drive, and I'm like, I just like appear.
[1601.46 → 1602.78] I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
[1602.94 → 1606.88] Like, I just, I appear at my destination and I just don't remember driving it.
[1608.66 → 1609.76] And I'm not drunk.
[1610.62 → 1611.00] I think.
[1612.50 → 1613.56] Nobody was thinking that.
[1613.64 → 1616.06] It's a little weird if you went right to that, Trash.
[1616.16 → 1616.98] It's a little weird.
[1618.08 → 1618.90] I don't know where I'm going.
[1618.90 → 1621.60] I do have a, I do also have a Coinbase founder.
[1622.12 → 1622.70] Wait, hang on.
[1622.84 → 1624.28] One last thing on this.
[1624.50 → 1624.96] Oh, sorry.
[1625.10 → 1625.58] I got one last thing.
[1625.64 → 1627.02] I got one last thing on the Airbnb thing.
[1627.42 → 1629.64] So Trash was like, I'm looking for experiences for my family.
[1629.70 → 1631.04] Did you actually look at the experiences?
[1631.18 → 1632.88] Because I don't understand them.
[1632.88 → 1636.90] Cause the ones that I'm sure these are like just marketing things, but it's literally like
[1636.90 → 1639.24] get a taste of Sabrina Carpenter.
[1639.36 → 1640.68] That one was so weird.
[1640.68 → 1644.06] I cannot believe they put that on the front page of all their advertising.
[1644.26 → 1646.46] I'm like, that is weird, dude.
[1646.78 → 1647.68] Mine had.
[1647.68 → 1649.36] You should just never say that phrase.
[1649.36 → 1649.76] It was normal.
[1650.80 → 1651.46] Mine were normal.
[1651.84 → 1653.24] So I didn't see anything where.
[1653.58 → 1654.46] What's normal for you?
[1654.46 → 1655.46] Did you get a taste of Sabrina?
[1656.08 → 1656.96] I did not.
[1657.08 → 1661.68] But I mean, you go to Joshua Tree, it's like yoga and look at the stars or see wildlife.
[1662.04 → 1665.08] Or if you're in where I live, it's like go whale watching or something.
[1665.20 → 1666.70] So it was like reasonable stuff.
[1666.70 → 1671.84] So I didn't see anything like SUS, and they all had like high ratings, and I'm going to
[1671.84 → 1674.28] like, I'm looking at generally like popular places.
[1674.28 → 1676.26] So like, usually it's going to have a good amount of choices.
[1676.60 → 1678.32] I don't know where you saw Sabrina Carpenter.
[1678.56 → 1679.92] Is that like their ad?
[1680.20 → 1680.86] Their marketing.
[1681.00 → 1681.62] I didn't pay for it.
[1681.62 → 1682.24] So I didn't see her.
[1682.94 → 1683.30] Yeah.
[1683.38 → 1684.14] He didn't taste her.
[1684.56 → 1685.34] He has no idea.
[1685.34 → 1691.44] But their ad was like hang out with Colin Kaepernick or something and like get a taste
[1691.44 → 1693.32] of Sabrina Carpenter, like a bunch of weird stuff.
[1693.44 → 1693.54] Yeah.
[1693.54 → 1697.40] When I looked in LA, there was like some, a lot of celebrity tour stuff or like meet
[1697.40 → 1699.12] or like have hanged out with one or something.
[1699.24 → 1699.50] I don't know.
[1699.54 → 1700.56] It's like cameo.
[1701.02 → 1701.22] Yeah.
[1701.34 → 1702.84] Basically like cameo, but a person.
[1702.94 → 1703.58] So even worse.
[1705.04 → 1705.78] I don't know.
[1707.14 → 1707.44] All right.
[1707.44 → 1713.72] It does seem like, it seems so weird because that seems like more of a thing you would do
[1713.72 → 1716.74] almost like with a hotel package or something.
[1716.88 → 1720.20] It just kind of strikes me as sort of weird for like Airbnb, this whole thing.
[1720.28 → 1722.08] Because you're like, you don't know if you're going to.
[1722.16 → 1723.22] I mean, you're replacing hotels.
[1723.30 → 1724.24] This sounds perfect then.
[1725.32 → 1725.44] Yeah.
[1725.46 → 1732.04] But it, but like, because aren't the experiences supposed to be like always available and like
[1732.04 → 1736.10] all this other, it just strikes me as kind of like a little bit of a weird mismatch in
[1736.10 → 1736.44] some ways.
[1736.44 → 1740.38] I mean, I guess like its good because they're gonna, you're going to be able to book more
[1740.38 → 1741.40] things through there.
[1741.40 → 1746.54] But like what I want from Airbnb is that I can like type something in of the stuff that
[1746.54 → 1746.96] I want.
[1747.08 → 1749.36] And it like actually goes and finds those.
[1749.56 → 1754.30] Like when I say that I want a waterfront one, it doesn't put me on the other side of like
[1754.30 → 1756.62] the golf and not do it.
[1756.62 → 1761.14] Like I feel like they have so much they could make better on their actual primary product.
[1761.14 → 1765.70] The golf, especially like dude, imagine just typing your family.
[1765.84 → 1766.14] Thank you.
[1766.14 → 1767.52] Thank you.
[1767.52 → 1767.78] Dax.
[1767.78 → 1768.80] It was a great joke.
[1768.98 → 1769.94] And I just said like, what?
[1769.94 → 1771.50] The golf of what?
[1772.00 → 1772.62] Oh, America.
[1772.62 → 1777.56] I was literally going to like to stop them and say that when I was like, yeah, well, it happens
[1777.56 → 1778.02] all the time.
[1778.08 → 1780.66] I feel like whenever I go somewhere, people just like, aren't telling the truth about
[1780.66 → 1782.34] their listing or like all this other stuff.
[1782.42 → 1786.00] Can they not just have like literally an AI go and look at the listing and I can type in,
[1786.08 → 1788.28] Hey, I want this many beds and separate rooms and all this stuff.
[1788.28 → 1792.60] And why is it not like listed and sorted out based on my, like that actually seems like
[1792.60 → 1793.92] I would like this experience.
[1793.92 → 1797.48] I would never use dumb hotel website, Google searches anymore.
[1797.48 → 1798.96] And I would always book with Airbnb.
[1799.28 → 1804.46] If I could just like type in a free text response, and they gave me back an awesome sorted rank
[1804.46 → 1805.68] of listings based on my thing.
[1805.96 → 1806.78] Like that's what I want.
[1806.84 → 1810.20] I don't want them to tell me which yoga studio I can go to.
[1810.20 → 1814.04] If I go visit Joshua to read with my family, you know, that's your fault.
[1814.56 → 1814.82] Yeah.
[1814.90 → 1815.18] Okay.
[1815.94 → 1816.40] All right.
[1816.40 → 1817.12] Well, I got a quote.
[1817.30 → 1818.12] I want to do this.
[1818.34 → 1821.44] And, and Dax, I think you already know this quote, but I feel like this is just such a
[1821.44 → 1822.02] magical quote.
[1822.42 → 1825.30] This is also from the founder of Airbnb in the same article.
[1825.56 → 1825.82] Dax.
[1825.86 → 1826.56] It's so blurry.
[1827.46 → 1828.78] I'll just, I'll just read it to you.
[1828.88 → 1833.66] He said this, Steve Jobs to me is like Michael D'Angelo or Da Vinci.
[1833.94 → 1835.92] He says, despite never meeting jobs.
[1836.10 → 1840.12] I feel like I know him deeply professionally in a way that few people.
[1840.20 → 1846.88] Ever did in a way that only you, let's see in a way that you only possibly could by starting
[1846.88 → 1850.72] a tech company as a creative person and going on a rocket ship.
[1853.64 → 1856.12] I think I was wrong.
[1856.30 → 1857.86] I think it might not just be cocaine.
[1862.98 → 1863.80] That's crazy.
[1864.10 → 1866.58] I, I don't have at it.
[1866.76 → 1869.58] No, I just love that quote to be like, yeah, I know Steve Jobs.
[1869.58 → 1869.82] Super.
[1869.94 → 1874.06] I mean, I never met him, but like, I know him in ways you can't better than anybody.
[1874.48 → 1877.22] Better than pretty much like, besides for maybe like his kids.
[1877.22 → 1879.00] Like I pretty much am like next in line.
[1879.42 → 1881.26] That's a it's just, you're right.
[1881.30 → 1881.54] Dax.
[1881.60 → 1882.86] I don't think it's just cocaine.
[1885.04 → 1886.82] That's a that's a ketamine trip right there.
[1886.86 → 1887.20] My friend.
[1889.20 → 1893.06] Imagine not only just like saying that, but then you're saying it somewhere that you can
[1893.06 → 1896.68] like get quoted and put it into an article that just feels insane.
[1896.96 → 1898.98] Like, I mean, it's one thing to just say it.
[1898.98 → 1899.54] Like, I don't know.
[1899.58 → 1900.10] It's a meeting.
[1900.10 → 1902.08] It's not like, yeah, I really can connect with Steve Jobs.
[1902.14 → 1904.40] You're like, I know him better than anyone.
[1904.52 → 1907.66] I started a tech company, and we went on a rocket ship together.
[1907.82 → 1910.04] You're like, can I get a quote from you?
[1910.04 → 1911.28] And you're like, I got the quote.
[1912.28 → 1914.60] You just sit down.
[1914.60 → 1916.42] I'm about to lay a deep one on you.
[1917.12 → 1919.56] And then it's also like, would, would not Steve Jobs?
[1919.70 → 1922.46] Just look, take one look at their new product and be like ugly.
[1922.72 → 1923.28] Don't ship.
[1924.44 → 1927.44] Like it just doesn't seem, I don't know.
[1927.84 → 1929.90] I also love like they're spiritually aligned.
[1930.20 → 1930.50] Yeah.
[1930.56 → 1935.74] I also love the fact that a guy from Apple designed the icons and in the article, sorry,
[1935.74 → 1937.34] I didn't, I didn't take a picture of this one.
[1937.58 → 1942.34] It was a he was just like, yeah, I'm not going to tell you who designed the icons.
[1942.50 → 1943.74] He's a secret weapon.
[1943.74 → 1945.38] I'll just say this much.
[1945.50 → 1946.64] He worked at Apple.
[1946.76 → 1948.34] Like that's literally what he'd like.
[1948.48 → 1953.68] Just genuinely withholding someone's like ability to be known for doing great icon design.
[1953.80 → 1955.20] No, dude, you know what that means?
[1955.50 → 1955.78] What?
[1956.64 → 1961.78] Some, some random designer who worked there used like open AI O3 to generate all of them.
[1961.78 → 1966.84] And like they didn't, they aren't willing to admit that they AI generated everything.
[1969.26 → 1971.92] Oh, it's a super secret designer from Apple.
[1971.92 → 1972.46] We can't tell you.
[1972.46 → 1973.32] We can't tell you about it.
[1973.32 → 1977.22] Summer intern who knows how to use image gen technology, dude.
[1978.08 → 1981.14] Well, did you see the, the post that Guillermo did?
[1981.24 → 1985.20] He made his own flavour of it using AI, and it came out really nice.
[1985.42 → 1985.78] It did.
[1985.84 → 1986.66] It was great and funny.
[1987.14 → 1989.50] He had, he had even worked in a JD Vance meme.
[1989.58 → 1990.06] It was great.
[1990.26 → 1990.56] Yeah.
[1990.68 → 1993.06] And it was just all AI gen and the whole animation and everything.
[1993.06 → 1995.20] And he like took his process.
[1995.46 → 1996.02] I see.
[1996.04 → 1997.44] I don't know what we're even talking about at this point.
[1997.46 → 1998.18] It's inside baseball.
[1998.18 → 2001.30] He just explained the whole situation.
[2004.60 → 2005.86] You're on the inside.
[2006.00 → 2006.44] Now.
[2006.74 → 2008.82] Now we all are inside the situation.
[2009.08 → 2010.40] He just explained it.
[2010.64 → 2011.10] I don't even know.
[2011.10 → 2012.40] Start over at the beginning again.
[2012.40 → 2015.82] I honestly, I thought I was following that.
[2015.82 → 2019.26] You guys were like, Hey, he generated like an Airbnb like thing.
[2019.38 → 2021.12] And then you're like, and then JD Vance.
[2021.20 → 2023.12] I'm like, I don't know what we're talking about anymore.
[2023.22 → 2025.56] I'm saying one of the icons was a JD Vance face.
[2025.70 → 2026.10] And it was funny.
[2026.10 → 2027.60] Now we have a taste of JD Vance.
[2027.68 → 2029.20] Is that what's, is that what you're referring to?
[2029.24 → 2030.56] No, I don't think we, they were doing that.
[2030.56 → 2036.60] I literally have no idea what he generated at this point without a picture and words on
[2036.60 → 2036.96] the screen.
[2037.10 → 2039.12] I'm pretty much completely confused at this point.
[2039.18 → 2042.32] So I'm on an extremely tight deadline, unfortunately.
[2042.32 → 2044.50] So I really did want to get to this.
[2044.70 → 2049.14] And so I just want to, I, I just want to say this for just a quick second, which is that
[2049.14 → 2050.22] Coinbase got hacked.
[2052.18 → 2060.14] I don't know if you guys have seen this, but staff got bribed and then Coinbase's response
[2060.14 → 2065.74] was that they're going to take the $20 million bribe and establish a $20 million reward fund
[2065.74 → 2070.58] instead of paying the briber or instead of paying the ransom, just pay somebody $20 million
[2070.58 → 2071.80] to lead to the arrest.
[2071.98 → 2075.10] And I just really wanted to say Coinbase.
[2075.54 → 2077.96] It's just so Coinbase right there.
[2078.12 → 2080.02] Wait, Trash, you can make $20 million.
[2080.40 → 2081.56] They're in Russia, right?
[2081.76 → 2082.28] That's what you said?
[2082.34 → 2083.72] Dude, you already know where they are.
[2083.94 → 2085.22] I already told them it was me.
[2086.98 → 2088.94] That's not how you make $20 million, Trash.
[2088.96 → 2089.90] I'm Spartacus.
[2090.14 → 2090.78] I got it.
[2090.78 → 2092.70] What were the terms on it?
[2092.74 → 2095.84] Because it's like, dude, they could turn themselves in, and they could get the $20 million either
[2095.84 → 2096.04] way.
[2096.16 → 2097.92] They UNO reversed the UNO reverse.
[2098.08 → 2098.76] You know what I'm saying?
[2099.46 → 2100.44] Turn it in my kids.
[2101.00 → 2102.82] They still get the bribe.
[2102.90 → 2104.00] They still get the ransom.
[2104.30 → 2105.18] They still get the money.
[2105.42 → 2107.18] By leading to the arrest.
[2107.94 → 2109.84] That would be, that'd be next level.
[2110.00 → 2110.28] There we go.
[2110.28 → 2111.38] That would be a next level play.
[2111.64 → 2114.50] I will say though, that is like a perfect response.
[2114.50 → 2119.38] And when I saw it, I was like, oh, I don't really care much about crypto or Coinbase or
[2119.38 → 2119.66] whatever.
[2119.66 → 2122.40] But you know, when he said that, I was like, yeah, I'd work for him.
[2122.50 → 2122.74] Maybe.
[2123.28 → 2123.68] I don't know.
[2124.08 → 2124.54] I don't know.
[2124.96 → 2126.24] I think he should grow a beard.
[2127.34 → 2130.26] Is it because he's completely bald all the way through?
[2130.26 → 2130.28] He's bald.
[2130.38 → 2131.82] He's just smooth.
[2132.06 → 2133.56] His head is completely smooth.
[2133.64 → 2135.80] So it needs some sort of differential feature on it.
[2135.80 → 2140.78] Most of my contributions about what founders look like and how they can improve.
[2141.38 → 2141.62] Yeah.
[2142.60 → 2144.40] That's why SST is doing so well.
[2145.24 → 2146.28] SST is in the black.
[2146.28 → 2147.24] Have you seen Jay?
[2148.54 → 2149.18] That's true.
[2149.24 → 2150.50] He's a very handsome lad.
[2151.32 → 2155.22] But it did kind of appear that his muscles were just for show when we were trying to lift
[2155.22 → 2155.60] things.
[2155.74 → 2157.06] And it's like, dude, those are show muscles.
[2157.34 → 2158.82] Why can't you lift anything?
[2160.62 → 2162.16] I'm just throwing it out there.
[2162.40 → 2163.28] Like, have a couch.
[2163.78 → 2165.10] Oh, that is the biggest burn.
[2165.10 → 2167.52] I'm just saying, like, pick up the couch, Jay.
[2167.56 → 2168.42] And he's like, ooh.
[2173.94 → 2175.90] Maybe he just wanted you to feel strong, TJ.
[2176.80 → 2178.28] Like, and so it's just like, oh, it's so hard.
[2178.28 → 2179.32] I'm not competing with him.
[2181.62 → 2184.14] We're in very different life stages at the moment.
[2184.76 → 2185.80] T's just staring at Jay.
[2185.92 → 2186.24] Really?
[2186.84 → 2187.16] Really?
[2187.16 → 2191.28] I mean, he's a handsome guy, but that's all I'm saying.
[2191.58 → 2191.96] That's all I'm saying.
[2192.16 → 2193.72] Jay, if you see this later, sorry, dude.
[2193.72 → 2195.48] We have to be done.
[2195.68 → 2195.92] Okay.
[2195.98 → 2199.12] Like, I really appreciate this conversation, but there's no more about Jay.
[2199.34 → 2199.70] All right.
[2199.94 → 2202.56] Hey, thank you, everybody, for being here.
[2202.64 → 2203.74] I am now going to leave.
[2203.86 → 2204.62] Bye, everybody.
[2205.20 → 2206.98] Thanks for joining this stand-up.
[2208.42 → 2209.92] Sorry that I had to end this so abruptly.
[2209.92 → 2235.06] Booze up the day, 是我 card
