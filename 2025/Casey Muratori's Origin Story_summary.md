• Introduction to stand-up comedy with Trash and Casey
• Discussion of Trash's snack addiction, specifically his 9am Doritos habit
• Casey is introduced as the next speaker to share his origin story
• Origin story: Jonathan Blow's demo of JAI/JAI (compiler) in 2014, which showcased metaprogramming capabilities and robustness
• Discussion of how JAI allowed for game development and execution at compile time, with interesting features like compiling a game that plays the game itself
• Commentary on how AI and machine learning have advanced since 2014
• The speaker discusses the challenge of making money from creating a language.
• Bill Hall's company Jenga Effects uses Odin and shows a successful model for language development.
• Starting a company to solve a problem using a custom language is proposed as a viable approach.
• Paying a person to develop and maintain a language as an employee can be effective.
• Examples of companies like Jane Street using their own forks of existing languages are mentioned.
• Oxidizing OCaml: introducing lifetime-related features from Rust
• Jane Street's efforts to improve OCaml with compiler optimizations
• OCaml's use in high-performance applications, such as FPGAs
• Comparison of OCaml and Haskell development communities
• The practicality of the OCaml community versus the theoretical focus of Haskell
• Discussion about Rust programming language and its features
• Global vs local ownership in Rust
• Lifetime semantics in Rust
• Comparison with other languages (implying garbage collector)
• Mention of John's Twitch streams and its relation to a "John show" or recurring show
• Reference to the speaker's work on the Witness game and publishing a blog
• Difficulty designing games
• Preference for creating engines rather than game design
• Importance of a good prompt engineer in team development
• Success of Handmade Hero due to its explanation of underlying programming concepts
• Challenge of introducing complex programming topics in an accessible way
• The person was surprised by the impact of their series on others, including professional programmers who credited it with inspiring their own projects.
• Handmade Hero is mentioned as an example of a project that started from watching the series and went on to create complex software.
• The person reflects on how they didn't realize the full potential of their series and its effect on others until attending the Better Software Conference.
• They discuss the features of Handmade Hero, including its built-in profiler, 3D graphics, and ray-traced lighting.
• The person initially lost interest in creating software but was reinvigorated after attending the conference and now plans to create a condensed version of their series.
• Discussion about a streaming decision being reconsidered
• Impact of a series (BSC) on the speaker's mind and motivation
• Effectiveness of software (handmade hero) in changing user behavior
• Importance of feedback from users to developers
• Value of anecdotal evidence and personal connections in motivating action
• Surprise at the reach and influence of an event or project
• Personal experience with attending a conference without prior knowledge, but being positively surprised
• The speaker compares a programming event to the Game Developers Conference (GDC) from their past experience.
• The GDC was originally called the Computer Game Developers Conference (CGDC), started by Chris Crawford.
• The speaker reminisces about attending SIGGRAPH as a child, but being unable to attend due to an age restriction.
• They speculate on the purpose of this rule and suggest it may be intended to prevent parents from bringing uninterested children.
• Restrictions on attendees for the paper presentation
• Expo floor access and limited other areas
• The film and video show as a separate event with its own content
• Pixar's early work, including "Tin Toy", "Red's Dream", and "Knickknack"
• Conventions and industry events in general
• CGDC (Computer Game Developers Conference) in 96 or 97
• Meeting notable figures in the game programming industry
• The speaker expresses disdain for the GDC (Game Developers Conference) and views it as a corporate event focused on making money.
• They compare their experience at BSC to early times when they were enthusiastic about game development, implying that over time their enthusiasm was crushed by commercialism.
• The speaker reflects on how attending BSC initially felt exciting but ultimately became disillusioning, much like the GDC.
