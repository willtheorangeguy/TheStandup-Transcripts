[0.00 → 1.80] Hey, what's the name of the stand-up today?
[3.38 → 5.92] The stand-up. It's always the stand-up.
[6.08 → 8.58] Welcome to the stand-up. It's the same thing every time.
[9.38 → 10.44] We don't change the title.
[10.66 → 13.84] It'll be Trash's snack addiction right now with his microphone on.
[14.06 → 15.18] What are you doing?
[15.66 → 17.26] I'm getting my 9am Doritos.
[19.24 → 19.92] Hashtag ad.
[20.18 → 20.94] You guys don't get this?
[20.94 → 21.32] Oh yeah.
[21.94 → 24.08] My 9am chip break.
[24.30 → 27.80] Could you tell us a little bit about the flavour, or dare I say,
[27.80 → 30.56] taste sensation that you're experiencing right now?
[31.00 → 34.04] Well, all I'm saying is that I don't ever eat breakfast,
[34.22 → 36.42] but when I'm sitting in a meeting, I just have to snack.
[36.66 → 36.88] Okay.
[36.98 → 37.96] I just don't know.
[38.16 → 40.20] I bought these yesterday after dinner.
[40.68 → 42.18] I got party size.
[43.02 → 45.30] Because it's always a party with Trash.
[49.58 → 50.54] Anyway, sorry.
[50.66 → 51.68] I forgot to do the intro.
[52.22 → 52.70] Hey, everybody.
[52.82 → 55.58] On today's stand-up, we're going to be listening to Casey.
[55.58 → 57.78] Casey, and then Trash just left.
[57.94 → 58.82] Ruined my entire view.
[58.90 → 59.24] Thank you.
[59.54 → 61.04] Today we're going to be listening to Casey.
[61.22 → 62.30] Hey, Trash, he's back.
[62.64 → 67.42] We're going to be listening to Casey give his origin story.
[68.24 → 69.28] Very exciting.
[70.80 → 72.12] Casey, take it away.
[72.70 → 75.60] So the origin story is not even going to be three minutes.
[75.64 → 76.78] I'm going to have to pad this thing.
[76.78 → 83.36] What happened was that Jonathan Blow started, I don't even know.
[83.44 → 84.28] You'll have to ask him.
[84.64 → 90.74] He decided to stream his compiler, like a demo of his compiler.
[91.40 → 94.26] That's what actually originally happened to start it.
[94.36 → 97.66] Because I don't know if you remember, but he made like the JAI,
[97.94 → 102.34] he did a demo of JAI really early on where like you could play Galata
[102.34 → 104.08] basically at compile time.
[105.08 → 105.76] Oh, nice.
[105.96 → 106.14] No.
[106.88 → 108.20] Explain that a little bit more.
[108.58 → 111.44] I better because we got to pad this out to 30 minutes.
[112.86 → 117.98] So one of JAI's big original features that now like everyone has copied,
[118.14 → 123.78] albeit poorly, is that anything that you do in the language can be run at
[123.78 → 124.58] either time.
[124.58 → 129.72] It can either be executed at compile time or it can be executed as like,
[129.80 → 132.04] or it can be compiled into the program and executed there.
[132.24 → 132.36] Right.
[133.62 → 136.96] And so he demoed that in literally like 2014.
[137.26 → 139.70] Like that's how far ahead he was of everybody else.
[140.50 → 145.56] And that because he wanted to demo that he had a game.
[145.94 → 149.76] And what you could do is you could compile the game with JAI,
[149.90 → 152.90] but the act of compiling the game would play the game.
[152.90 → 158.56] Then the number of like enemies you killed during,
[158.74 → 159.62] before you died.
[159.76 → 161.90] And when you died, it would stop and finish to compile.
[162.34 → 168.60] That number would get compiled into the executable that it actually produced.
[168.76 → 168.94] Right.
[169.04 → 170.22] As it was just a cool demo.
[170.30 → 173.06] He was just trying to demo the fact that you could do anything at,
[173.06 → 178.32] at compile time that you wanted to show how like robust the metaprogramming
[178.32 → 179.90] was going to be in this thing.
[179.90 → 183.86] So he did a demo where he showed that and lots of other things like,
[184.00 → 184.46] you know,
[184.50 → 188.26] lots of other JAI features that he had implemented in the first round of
[188.26 → 189.00] JAI stuff.
[190.00 → 192.68] And are you calling it JAI or JI?
[193.62 → 194.54] J AI.
[195.62 → 197.18] I was wondering about that too.
[197.18 → 197.74] Because I was thinking,
[197.86 → 198.06] man,
[198.18 → 200.68] he really was kind of way ahead of his time.
[200.74 → 203.04] He was putting AI into everything before it was cool.
[203.38 → 204.20] That's a good point.
[204.20 → 206.40] If you called it JAI.
[206.92 → 207.24] Yeah.
[207.84 → 208.44] Jonathan AI.
[208.46 → 209.34] John's AI.
[209.74 → 210.04] Yes.
[210.26 → 210.66] But,
[210.82 → 211.38] but no,
[211.60 → 212.74] I don't know that he,
[212.80 → 213.84] I don't know that he realized.
[213.96 → 214.14] Well,
[214.22 → 217.08] the reason that I don't think that he realized that was,
[217.16 → 217.24] yeah,
[217.26 → 218.30] because he didn't,
[218.38 → 221.72] you could run this on a single machine instead of having to have a data
[221.72 → 225.28] centre full of like 100,000 Blackwell GPUs.
[225.28 → 226.46] AI wasn't that advanced back then.
[226.68 → 228.72] Like this was pretty normal behaviour in 2014.
[229.32 → 229.46] Yeah.
[229.46 → 230.70] But then how do you make money?
[232.50 → 232.82] Yeah.
[233.34 → 233.70] Well,
[233.80 → 236.48] that I think John would like to know how to make money for making a
[236.48 → 236.78] language.
[236.78 → 237.72] Cause most of the time,
[237.78 → 239.60] nobody really makes money for making a language,
[239.74 → 239.90] right?
[239.90 → 241.40] You do all this work and like,
[241.44 → 242.26] you don't really make money.
[242.36 → 243.76] So it's often like some other thing.
[243.84 → 244.08] I mean,
[244.08 → 244.86] like for example,
[245.02 → 245.56] Bill Hall,
[245.66 → 247.96] like he kind of works with Jena effects,
[248.00 → 248.92] which uses Odin,
[249.02 → 249.24] right?
[249.24 → 250.06] Like you,
[250.12 → 250.78] you always have to,
[250.90 → 251.60] it sucks.
[251.60 → 254.04] Like it would be cool if when you made a cool language,
[254.04 → 257.04] that that was actually going to be payment in and of itself.
[257.04 → 261.02] But usually it's not because that's just the way the industry has shaken
[261.02 → 261.36] out,
[261.42 → 264.98] which of course also means you don't maybe get as much work on languages
[264.98 → 267.86] as you would like because people aren't being paid to do it.
[267.86 → 268.16] Right.
[268.70 → 272.18] Or they're getting paid to do it only pretty far after the fact when like
[272.18 → 273.40] some company,
[273.40 → 273.90] you know,
[273.94 → 276.02] decides that maybe they're going to fund this thing or whatever.
[276.02 → 276.90] So it's kind of,
[276.90 → 278.90] it always has to find this sort of like,
[279.20 → 282.72] like a secondary funding model,
[282.72 → 283.00] right?
[283.02 → 283.84] Like that's not the
[284.00 → 285.28] not primarily you're not,
[285.56 → 287.42] you weren't just paid because you made a language.
[287.42 → 290.02] You have to be paid because the language is used by a company that's doing
[290.02 → 290.84] something or whatever.
[291.06 → 291.44] Developers.
[291.48 → 295.24] Are you tired of code reviews that just say looks good to me or here's seven
[295.24 → 297.86] things I need you to change that are irrelevant to the PR.

[335.60 → 336.50] So anyway,
[336.68 → 337.42] ginger bills model,
[337.42 → 341.36] like the best model for making a profitable language is to just start a
[341.36 → 344.78] company that you solve a problem by writing a language for a first,
[345.30 → 346.18] which sounds very hard.
[346.18 → 347.44] I don't know.
[347.44 → 348.16] I mean,
[348.16 → 350.44] you should ask him,
[350.56 → 351.50] have him on the standup.
[351.50 → 352.00] Uh,
[352.00 → 352.66] but,
[352.78 → 353.16] uh,
[353.44 → 354.02] I,
[354.34 → 356.60] I would imagine that it's a pretty good way.
[356.60 → 357.38] Like if,
[357.38 → 357.40] if,
[357.40 → 362.08] if you have a company like Jena effects that wants to do some cool stuff and
[362.08 → 362.40] they're like,
[362.52 → 365.64] we kind of just don't want to be shackled to like C plus anymore.
[366.16 → 370.70] We want to have the flexibility to like to get language features in a timely
[370.70 → 373.88] fashion that are well-designed and don't go through a committee that will make
[373.88 → 374.46] them terrible.
[375.18 → 375.62] Uh,
[375.78 → 376.28] then,
[376.42 → 376.72] you know,
[376.72 → 378.62] if you've got someone who you trust,
[378.70 → 380.48] who you can work with to do that,
[380.60 → 385.36] I think it would make perfect sense to pay them as an employee to just be the
[385.36 → 386.02] language guy.
[386.02 → 386.42] Right.
[386.70 → 387.10] Um,
[387.38 → 388.52] and you know,
[388.68 → 388.88] I,
[388.88 → 391.68] I don't know how they all feel like this all worked out.
[391.74 → 392.44] You could ask them,
[392.50 → 394.10] but I'm imagining their very happy.
[394.20 → 397.30] They have very successful products written entirely in Odin.
[397.84 → 400.18] Bill has really liked making Odin.
[400.42 → 402.58] So I think it was a win-win for everybody.
[402.96 → 403.32] Uh,
[403.54 → 404.22] but you know,
[404.82 → 405.04] we should,
[405.04 → 405.50] you should ask him,
[405.56 → 406.12] have him on the show.
[406.24 → 406.70] See what he says.
[407.32 → 409.22] Jane street is doing this basically too.
[409.36 → 412.10] Like they've got their own fork of O camel and everything.
[412.10 → 413.80] And they just released their own.
[413.80 → 415.10] Like now it's more,
[415.10 → 415.80] uh,
[416.58 → 418.98] like accessible for other people to try out their fork.
[419.14 → 420.32] It was pretty accessible before,
[420.32 → 424.90] but they like released it with a bunch of language features that they hope get
[424.90 → 425.70] put into O camel.
[425.82 → 426.44] But they're also like,
[426.48 → 427.24] we don't really care.
[427.30 → 428.02] In some ways,
[428.08 → 428.26] maybe,
[428.40 → 428.80] sorry,
[428.86 → 430.16] that's probably like a little bit,
[430.16 → 430.92] uh,
[430.92 → 432.28] reading between the lines to,
[432.40 → 432.78] to the
[432.78 → 433.90] to the Jane street folks.
[433.90 → 434.92] Because they do try,
[435.02 → 437.52] but like they have a whole team working on the compiler,
[437.68 → 438.52] doing crazy stuff,
[438.58 → 439.72] making it awesome.
[440.00 → 440.62] What's it called?
[440.62 → 441.30] Like for them.
[441.52 → 441.76] What?
[442.06 → 442.64] What's it called?
[442.64 → 443.90] It's called ox camel.
[444.04 → 444.60] Because it's like,
[444.64 → 445.94] it's introducing.
[446.28 → 446.56] Okay.
[446.84 → 447.02] Yeah.
[447.02 → 448.88] It's introducing a bunch of like ideas.
[449.12 → 449.78] Lifetime ones.
[450.14 → 450.32] Yeah.
[450.38 → 450.56] Yeah.
[450.56 → 453.84] Related to like this idea of oxidizing O camel,
[454.18 → 456.70] like bringing some of the features from rust.
[457.36 → 458.20] Into O camel,
[458.36 → 459.22] but in a like,
[460.58 → 461.80] but in a convenient way.
[461.80 → 462.44] Yeah.
[462.64 → 462.76] Yeah.
[462.86 → 463.18] Right.
[463.18 → 466.06] It shouldn't change like the base way that you write O camel.
[466.20 → 468.16] But then when you want to try and do something where you're saying,
[468.24 → 468.34] Hey,
[468.34 → 469.56] like let's allocate less,
[469.58 → 471.44] like let's not get this to the garbage collector.
[471.44 → 474.20] We're going to have some proper ownership semantics of these things.
[474.20 → 475.92] You can specify those.
[475.92 → 476.52] And it just makes,
[476.90 → 478.40] then you don't have to switch to a new language,
[478.40 → 478.68] right.
[478.68 → 479.48] To write the other part.
[479.56 → 479.98] So it's very,
[480.06 → 480.60] it's very cool.
[481.02 → 484.84] They're using it a lot because they have to write fast code to trade things
[484.84 → 485.94] faster than other people.
[485.94 → 487.90] I guess I don't really know what they do,
[487.98 → 488.52] except like,
[488.56 → 490.56] it seems like FPGAs and O camel.
[490.70 → 491.20] That's all I know.
[491.50 → 494.26] They do have a thing where you can program FPGAs with O camel.
[494.40 → 494.50] Yeah.
[494.54 → 495.30] Called hard camel.
[495.50 → 499.90] But I think they just have a big printer inside where they print money.
[499.98 → 500.30] Like,
[500.32 → 501.16] I'm not really sure.
[501.72 → 502.24] I'm not that Casey.
[502.32 → 502.90] That's not a joke,
[502.94 → 503.22] by the way.
[503.22 → 503.80] That's a real thing.
[503.86 → 504.42] They have that.
[504.42 → 508.36] I kind of want to go look at this now because I would have thought that O camel
[508.36 → 509.02] would,
[509.72 → 510.20] I mean,
[510.38 → 512.90] are FP bros furious that,
[513.02 → 517.42] that like people are suggesting that you need features from rust to make O camel
[517.42 → 518.10] better?
[518.30 → 519.24] Like what,
[519.40 → 520.32] how did that go over?
[521.14 → 521.58] Um,
[522.50 → 523.22] I think it's good.
[523.28 → 523.86] I think it's good.
[524.30 → 524.52] I think,
[524.52 → 526.60] I think people in the O camel community like it.
[526.66 → 527.52] I think it's pretty cool.
[527.84 → 527.98] Yeah.
[528.04 → 528.40] I mean,
[528.96 → 531.62] O camel is much more pragmatic than like Haskell bros,
[531.70 → 531.90] right?
[531.90 → 532.62] They're kind of like,
[532.80 → 532.96] that's true.
[533.20 → 533.22] So,
[533.42 → 533.98] and it's,
[533.98 → 536.30] and all the people like most interested in it,
[536.32 → 537.58] I think are like,
[537.64 → 540.82] it's cool that Jane street makes money, and we're like more confident.
[540.92 → 541.12] Okay.
[541.12 → 543.14] And we'll still be a thing in five years.
[543.38 → 543.50] Like,
[543.64 → 543.80] okay.
[543.96 → 544.50] Cause you know,
[544.60 → 545.26] sponsor now,
[545.26 → 545.54] right.
[545.62 → 545.84] It's got,
[545.96 → 546.22] I mean,
[546.22 → 547.30] it has for a long time.
[547.30 → 547.48] Right.
[547.48 → 549.44] But that's kind of nice to see like,
[549.48 → 549.58] Oh,
[549.58 → 553.52] they can push forward like their vision of some stuff and see what happens.
[553.52 → 554.12] I don't know.
[554.26 → 554.68] I like,
[554.70 → 555.26] I think it's,
[555.34 → 555.80] I think it's cool.
[555.82 → 556.68] It's very interesting too,
[556.68 → 560.26] because most of the time I feel like when I write rust,
[560.26 → 561.44] I really just want to say like,
[561.52 → 563.92] does this thing live in this function or does it,
[563.92 → 565.66] like escape the function,
[565.74 → 565.86] right?
[565.96 → 568.04] Global or local like ownership.
[568.24 → 572.38] And that would simplify like a lot of very painful things in rust.
[572.38 → 575.48] If you couldn't specify like in between lifetimes,
[575.58 → 575.70] like,
[575.82 → 575.92] Oh,
[575.92 → 579.32] it lasts as long as like the outer scope of this function attached to like
[579.32 → 579.54] this,
[579.66 → 579.82] right?
[579.82 → 584.12] Like that's where a lot of really painful lifetime semantics come in,
[584.12 → 585.38] but like for okay.
[585.38 → 585.54] Well,
[585.54 → 585.80] it's like,
[585.86 → 585.98] Oh,
[586.04 → 588.42] well we can just say like the garbage collector will handle it.
[588.42 → 589.82] If it escapes this region.
[590.22 → 592.96] Otherwise we're going to basically like stack allocate it.
[593.30 → 593.70] Not,
[593.80 → 594.50] not exactly,
[594.62 → 595.44] but like close.
[595.44 → 598.40] And then we'll be able to like free those really quickly and easily.
[598.40 → 602.22] So it has a lot of cool features that are not like just straight wholesale
[602.22 → 603.84] copied from rust,
[604.06 → 604.28] but,
[604.36 → 604.72] uh,
[605.10 → 607.24] that I think will improve the language,
[607.24 → 609.58] like in terms of making it go zoom,
[609.66 → 611.00] zoom and like,
[611.14 → 611.64] uh,
[611.64 → 613.94] multicore safe stuff too,
[614.00 → 614.58] which is nice.
[615.34 → 615.52] Dan,
[615.56 → 616.08] that's crazy.
[616.22 → 616.54] Uh,
[616.86 → 617.38] Casey,
[617.38 → 618.92] we got to get back to your origin story.
[619.00 → 621.06] We're so far out of the pot right now,
[621.06 → 622.02] but that's it.
[622.02 → 622.26] I mean,
[622.26 → 624.42] like literally if you guys don't keep doing that,
[624.46 → 626.40] there is no standup because we are now,
[626.52 → 630.24] we have now finished a minute and 30 seconds of the three minutes that I've
[630.24 → 630.46] got.
[630.46 → 633.76] So the next thing I say is going to be the end of the story.
[634.28 → 634.96] I'm ready.
[635.12 → 635.88] Don't worry.
[636.30 → 636.70] Don't worry.
[636.70 → 637.76] We got something for you.
[637.86 → 639.88] So John did that.
[640.02 → 640.94] He did that,
[640.98 → 641.64] that demo.
[641.90 → 643.72] And there were maybe like three,
[643.72 → 645.28] it was like three streams or something.
[645.38 → 646.74] He did like a series of them.
[647.04 → 649.78] So it wasn't really a recurring show,
[649.78 → 651.22] but it was kind of like,
[651.28 → 651.46] Oh,
[651.56 → 653.32] John's kind of streaming now.
[653.44 → 653.84] Right.
[654.24 → 654.64] Uh,
[654.84 → 656.34] and is this on Twitch or like,
[656.42 → 656.84] it was,
[656.92 → 657.46] it was on Twitch.
[657.46 → 658.90] And then he posted them on YouTube afters,
[658.94 → 659.42] but it was,
[659.46 → 660.12] it was on Twitch.
[660.96 → 663.32] And so at that point,
[663.32 → 666.20] because people knew I had worked on the witness,
[666.20 → 669.70] because I used to publish this little blog called witness Wednesdays,
[669.70 → 672.66] where I would talk about something that we were doing,
[672.66 → 673.42] um,
[673.42 → 674.02] on the
[674.14 → 674.80] on the game.
[675.86 → 676.26] And,
[676.36 → 677.30] uh,
[677.30 → 677.98] people knew,
[678.18 → 679.20] so people knew that.
[679.38 → 680.72] And they asked me,
[680.76 → 682.36] when was I going to stream on Twitch?
[683.92 → 684.36] Right.
[684.80 → 685.68] They were just like,
[685.68 → 685.86] Oh,
[685.94 → 687.96] John's John streaming on Twitch,
[687.96 → 690.36] which he hadn't like committed to or anything.
[690.36 → 691.56] He didn't start the John show,
[691.58 → 692.18] but he is like,
[692.32 → 694.54] he had enough on Twitch that kind of seemed like,
[694.58 → 694.68] Oh,
[694.72 → 694.88] okay.
[694.88 → 696.32] John's just going to be doing streaming now.
[696.32 → 696.86] Like he would,
[697.02 → 700.66] I think he maybe even did some when he just was working a little bit.
[700.66 → 700.84] Right.
[700.84 → 701.20] So he,
[701.28 → 704.06] he was like the person who started that whole thing was him.
[704.82 → 705.22] Uh,
[705.28 → 705.68] and,
[705.80 → 706.70] and so then I was like,
[706.74 → 707.06] all right,
[707.06 → 708.30] I guess I'll try something.
[709.54 → 710.18] There you go.
[710.34 → 710.44] Try.
[711.14 → 711.38] Yeah.
[711.38 → 712.36] What did you try though?
[712.68 → 713.16] Handmade hero,
[713.56 → 714.34] which is,
[714.34 → 716.20] I know what it is,
[716.30 → 716.46] Casey,
[716.60 → 717.76] but I mean,
[717.76 → 719.08] I just tried like doing anything.
[719.20 → 719.22] Well,
[719.28 → 720.52] I'll just start making a game.
[720.82 → 722.58] I'll do all the things that we normally do.
[722.78 → 723.12] Right.
[723.14 → 723.42] I'm like,
[723.46 → 723.58] well,
[723.58 → 724.50] make a platform layer.
[724.66 → 724.90] I'll,
[724.98 → 725.12] you know,
[725.12 → 726.76] make a rendering backend.
[727.00 → 727.18] I'll,
[727.26 → 727.42] you know,
[727.42 → 729.46] show out a load bitmap and that stuff.
[730.02 → 730.40] That's,
[730.50 → 730.92] that was it.
[731.70 → 732.52] So I just,
[732.66 → 735.58] what did you end up making the game all the way through?
[736.08 → 736.44] No.
[736.58 → 736.94] I mean,
[736.94 → 737.52] like it's,
[737.64 → 737.74] it,
[738.10 → 740.36] as with everything,
[740.36 → 741.88] I cannot design games.
[741.88 → 743.70] I am so bad at it.
[743.86 → 744.88] So basically like,
[745.26 → 745.62] really,
[745.70 → 747.54] you can only count on me to make engines.
[747.74 → 749.42] That's all I know how to make.
[749.68 → 750.52] If that makes sense.
[750.60 → 754.60] Like I kind of need somebody else to come in and do whatever the game is.
[754.60 → 758.04] And then just tell me what you need, and I will make that for you.
[758.04 → 758.32] Right.
[759.06 → 762.82] But like game design stuff is just not my thing.
[763.22 → 763.98] And so,
[764.10 → 766.16] so you need a good prompt engineer on your team,
[766.26 → 766.52] Casey,
[766.78 → 767.08] you know,
[767.12 → 767.78] who's there.
[767.78 → 769.16] They're prompting you for,
[769.50 → 769.76] yeah,
[769.86 → 771.14] basically advanced AI.
[771.14 → 772.94] You don't even need to be a good prompt engineer.
[773.06 → 773.72] You can just be vague.
[773.86 → 775.14] Like I need the thing that has,
[775.94 → 776.48] you know,
[776.52 → 777.72] this going on, and I'll be like,
[777.74 → 777.96] all right,
[778.60 → 780.06] we'll get that for you.
[781.34 → 781.78] Certainly.
[782.52 → 782.96] Absolutely.
[783.08 → 783.58] You're right.
[785.32 → 786.50] What a great idea.
[786.96 → 787.48] So anyway,
[787.66 → 788.60] that happened.
[788.60 → 790.38] And for some reason it was very popular.
[791.60 → 792.58] Because it's good.
[793.06 → 793.32] Jeez.
[793.38 → 794.70] I wonder why it was popular,
[794.86 → 795.10] Casey.
[796.20 → 797.48] I don't really know.
[797.48 → 798.28] That's the thing.
[798.28 → 803.64] What I've heard since then is that the problem for a lot of people is that like,
[803.64 → 805.72] they thought that programming was like,
[806.42 → 812.14] you have to just learn these giant stacks of random stuff that don't really make sense to them.
[812.14 → 816.56] And this was the first time they could see someone explaining like,
[816.84 → 817.00] well,
[817.10 → 817.38] okay,
[817.38 → 819.88] so here's like the operating system part.
[819.88 → 821.02] And here's how that works.
[821.02 → 822.14] And here's the memory part.
[822.14 → 823.06] And here's how that works.
[823.06 → 825.12] And we can just like directly poke at that.
[825.12 → 826.12] And there's a window.
[826.12 → 826.52] And then like,
[826.56 → 828.92] and then we could directly poke at this and here's the bitmap.
[829.04 → 829.20] Right.
[829.22 → 830.40] And here's how we read.
[830.40 → 830.66] Like,
[831.16 → 831.48] you know,
[831.60 → 836.10] a bitmap file is literally just these things on the drive and there's the colour values.
[836.10 → 836.32] Right.
[836.36 → 840.82] And I think like for a certain class of programmer,
[841.10 → 846.66] that is something that they really needed because they were never shown that.
[846.66 → 851.60] Like it was hard for them to find an introduction into that kind of programming.
[852.18 → 853.92] And so what ended up happening,
[854.10 → 857.34] like most of Handmade Hero is not necessary.
[857.34 → 861.16] They just need like the first 30 episodes where I just show like,
[861.52 → 863.94] here's how you make a program that does these things.
[864.06 → 867.82] And then for the people who seem to be fans of the series,
[868.00 → 870.42] that was just like a big eye-opener for them.
[870.52 → 871.46] And then they are just like,
[871.50 → 871.62] oh,
[871.68 → 871.92] okay,
[872.02 → 873.78] I can just go make stuff now.
[873.92 → 874.88] And then they did.
[875.26 → 875.46] Right.
[875.46 → 877.50] And so like,
[877.56 → 878.34] that's what happened.
[878.46 → 879.10] That was like,
[879.14 → 886.66] basically one of the things that was so cool for me about that better software conference is like so many of the people were like,
[886.74 → 888.82] I got started by watching Handmade Hero.
[889.08 → 890.06] And then I'm like,
[890.54 → 893.74] and then that person went on to make something absolutely insane,
[893.74 → 894.52] like the
[894.58 → 896.00] like file pilot or something.
[896.00 → 896.36] Right.
[896.36 → 899.50] Like stuff that's so fricking cool that I'm like,
[899.58 → 904.56] I cannot believe that that was because of this stupid series I made.
[904.56 → 904.96] Right.
[905.46 → 905.90] Uh,
[905.90 → 907.22] and that was a really like,
[907.30 → 910.68] it was kind of incredible and totally blew my mind because I didn't really,
[910.68 → 911.28] uh,
[911.28 → 911.94] think about,
[912.10 → 919.26] I didn't think that it was going to have the effect where like really great programmers would go on to do these amazing things.
[919.26 → 919.72] Right.
[919.72 → 920.16] Uh,
[920.16 → 921.84] just from this little bit of like,
[921.94 → 922.10] Hey,
[922.14 → 922.88] you can do this.
[923.00 → 924.76] You don't have to do this other thing.
[924.76 → 925.56] You could do this thing.
[925.68 → 926.04] Like,
[926.08 → 926.98] that's all they needed.
[927.02 → 928.04] And then from there,
[928.04 → 930.34] they're just like going off into the stratosphere,
[930.56 → 931.68] doing these amazing things.
[932.16 → 932.56] Uh,
[932.56 → 933.24] and so like,
[933.24 → 934.12] it was really cool.
[934.12 → 934.84] And it was kind of like,
[934.90 → 935.26] Oh wow.
[935.26 → 937.56] Like they are literally making software better.
[937.80 → 938.12] Like,
[938.30 → 938.72] uh,
[939.12 → 939.66] it was,
[939.74 → 940.38] it was super cool.
[941.32 → 941.60] Yeah.
[941.66 → 941.88] I didn't,
[942.00 → 943.20] so I'm not familiar with handmade here.
[943.22 → 947.34] And I looked it up while you were talking, and I saw it was like at 656 episodes.
[947.84 → 948.08] Yeah.
[948.10 → 949.40] And there's so much stuff in there.
[949.46 → 950.38] Like it built you,
[950.56 → 952.70] there's a thing you show how to build like a debug system.
[952.70 → 955.38] It's got a profiler that's built in that runs in real time.
[955.38 → 957.86] You can see like zones and everything inside the game.
[957.86 → 958.44] And it's got,
[958.50 → 959.22] it actually,
[959.22 → 960.40] I added 3d later.
[960.62 → 961.92] So it's got 3d and lighting.
[962.08 → 963.90] It's got ray traced lighting and that kind of stuff.
[963.98 → 965.06] It's got a lot of stuff in there.
[965.76 → 966.08] Um,
[966.88 → 968.98] I don't know how much of its helpful for people.
[969.12 → 971.20] I think like one of the things I learned,
[971.38 → 972.44] I think I,
[972.62 → 975.20] I was just kind of like done.
[975.28 → 975.40] Like,
[975.42 → 975.62] I'm like,
[975.64 → 977.30] I don't really care about doing this anymore.
[977.34 → 979.48] And I was pretty much just not interested in it.
[979.50 → 979.82] I'm like,
[979.88 → 980.04] I,
[980.34 → 980.80] you know,
[980.80 → 981.76] like what else am I going to do?
[982.00 → 983.94] But after going to better software conference,
[983.94 → 985.10] I kind of changed my mind on that.
[985.14 → 985.38] I was like,
[985.38 → 985.92] you know,
[986.04 → 989.86] I might want to just do a condensed version of this in the future where I
[989.86 → 991.16] just go through and go like,
[991.50 → 991.76] okay,
[991.76 → 994.54] now that I know what people actually needed out of this,
[994.74 → 997.62] I could put together something that's pretty good.
[997.84 → 998.66] That's like,
[998.96 → 1001.24] here's the like very simple,
[1001.24 → 1001.38] uh,
[1003.00 → 1005.42] straight line version of this that still keeps that,
[1005.48 → 1005.64] like,
[1005.64 → 1006.72] you see me doing it.
[1006.80 → 1007.72] So it's not weird,
[1007.72 → 1008.94] but that,
[1008.94 → 1009.26] uh,
[1009.26 → 1012.36] cuts out anything extraneous and gets to the
[1012.46 → 1012.60] you know,
[1012.60 → 1014.56] cause there are some things like ray tracing that just,
[1014.92 → 1016.40] you'd probably just don't want them in there.
[1016.48 → 1018.62] They took a really long time, and you have to do a lot of experimentation.
[1018.62 → 1019.40] It's just like,
[1019.40 → 1021.10] they account for like a hundred,
[1021.10 → 1021.58] uh,
[1021.58 → 1023.20] episodes out of the 600 or something.
[1023.20 → 1023.48] Right.
[1023.62 → 1024.98] And so you'd want to like,
[1025.04 → 1025.52] not,
[1025.62 → 1026.68] you'd want to be really careful.
[1026.68 → 1028.18] Or if you do something like that,
[1028.26 → 1029.72] do it in a much more controlled way.
[1029.72 → 1030.02] Right.
[1030.90 → 1031.26] Um,
[1031.26 → 1032.04] and so like,
[1032.74 → 1033.04] yeah,
[1033.12 → 1033.76] I kind of like,
[1033.86 → 1035.26] now I just don't know what I should do,
[1035.30 → 1035.76] but sorry.
[1035.80 → 1038.14] Was that you announcing that you're going to be streaming again?
[1038.42 → 1038.78] No,
[1039.32 → 1040.00] no.
[1040.52 → 1040.92] Uh,
[1040.92 → 1042.70] I have too much work right now to do,
[1042.78 → 1043.32] to do that.
[1043.32 → 1043.80] uh,
[1043.98 → 1045.92] but I'm just saying after BSC,
[1046.26 → 1047.60] I changed my mind about that.
[1047.72 → 1051.22] I w I would have said absolutely not three weeks ago,
[1051.22 → 1052.00] but now it's,
[1052.10 → 1052.86] that's good to know.
[1052.94 → 1053.68] That's good to know.
[1053.74 → 1054.44] But now I'm like,
[1054.46 → 1054.90] all right,
[1055.48 → 1059.16] this actually had an effect that really was impressive to me.
[1059.16 → 1059.92] Like I was like,
[1059.96 → 1063.94] I am shocked that people are saying these things about this series.
[1064.54 → 1065.02] Uh,
[1065.06 → 1065.98] and so now I'm like,
[1066.00 → 1066.36] okay,
[1067.68 → 1069.28] the chat changed my mind.
[1069.96 → 1070.42] Um,
[1071.54 → 1072.00] I mean,
[1072.00 → 1078.52] file palette is the thing I use now to browse files on my computer.
[1078.64 → 1079.04] Right.
[1079.08 → 1081.32] And so it's completely nuts to hear that,
[1081.32 → 1083.14] that handmade hero had,
[1083.22 → 1083.80] uh,
[1083.80 → 1087.20] an effect that like the person saying that he might not have done it.
[1087.20 → 1089.44] If it hadn't been for that series is absurd to me.
[1089.44 → 1089.76] Right.
[1090.04 → 1091.12] But incredibly,
[1091.12 → 1091.88] uh,
[1092.50 → 1094.90] emotional for me because what I cared about,
[1094.90 → 1098.02] like the whole reason that I do stuff usually is that I want the
[1098.02 → 1099.38] software to not suck as much.
[1099.38 → 1099.86] Right.
[1099.86 → 1102.80] And so to have like some evidence that actually like,
[1102.88 → 1103.16] okay,
[1103.16 → 1103.94] like people,
[1104.12 → 1107.30] there are perfect people who are going and doing this now who might
[1107.30 → 1108.06] not have done it.
[1108.28 → 1108.92] That's like,
[1109.16 → 1109.40] crap,
[1109.50 → 1111.10] then I needed to do this.
[1111.14 → 1111.40] Right.
[1111.44 → 1113.66] Like this was actually something that was worth doing.
[1114.28 → 1114.68] Uh,
[1115.34 → 1118.04] so don't forget that for every one person that you talk to,
[1118.04 → 1122.52] there could be a hundred or a thousand people that will never tell you a
[1122.52 → 1122.80] story.
[1122.80 → 1125.42] That's going to be similar in a way that you'll never be able to see.
[1125.48 → 1128.42] They're at a company, or they're somewhere else that are also exact same
[1128.42 → 1128.72] thing.
[1129.78 → 1130.18] Yeah.
[1130.18 → 1130.66] It's just,
[1130.74 → 1131.42] it's surprising,
[1131.56 → 1131.76] right?
[1131.82 → 1132.42] It's surprising,
[1132.42 → 1133.04] um,
[1133.04 → 1133.38] to me,
[1133.50 → 1134.02] but I,
[1134.16 → 1135.62] but I was super psyched about it.
[1135.62 → 1137.62] And I was so happy to hear that,
[1137.64 → 1138.08] uh,
[1138.08 → 1140.16] from so many people at that conference,
[1140.16 → 1140.74] uh,
[1140.74 → 1141.74] that I was just like,
[1141.94 → 1142.62] this is awesome.
[1142.78 → 1143.22] And,
[1143.28 → 1143.46] uh,
[1143.46 → 1144.20] because I didn't know,
[1144.20 → 1146.68] I didn't know anything about the conference going to it.
[1147.10 → 1147.50] Right.
[1148.30 → 1149.62] I literally knew nothing.
[1149.62 → 1151.06] I knew I was going to give a talk,
[1151.06 → 1151.50] uh,
[1151.50 → 1154.56] and that people who I thought were really cool were involved.
[1154.66 → 1155.06] Right.
[1155.24 → 1155.60] Um,
[1156.16 → 1156.94] that's all I knew.
[1157.32 → 1158.92] So it was kind of really,
[1159.00 → 1159.62] really amazing.
[1159.62 → 1163.92] And the kind of quality of talks that they had at the thing and just like
[1163.92 → 1164.48] how,
[1164.62 → 1168.24] how like serious everyone was about like programming there.
[1168.30 → 1169.40] It's just kind of nuts.
[1169.40 → 1169.66] Right.
[1169.76 → 1171.02] It felt a lot like,
[1171.26 → 1172.94] you know what it felt like?
[1172.94 → 1177.90] It felt a lot like when I first went to the CGDC.
[1178.16 → 1181.08] So before the game developers conference was called the game developers
[1181.08 → 1181.54] conference,
[1181.54 → 1184.50] it was called the computer game developers conference.
[1184.64 → 1186.86] It was actually started by Chris Crawford.
[1186.96 → 1188.24] If anyone knows who that is,
[1188.66 → 1190.02] it is like living room.
[1190.28 → 1190.68] Right.
[1191.48 → 1193.88] And it got bigger and bigger.
[1194.78 → 1196.50] And by the time I went,
[1196.56 → 1198.28] I think it was 96 or 97.
[1199.60 → 1200.60] It was big enough.
[1200.60 → 1201.96] That was being held in a hotel,
[1201.96 → 1202.78] a small one,
[1202.88 → 1203.70] I think in San Jose,
[1203.90 → 1204.66] if I remember correctly.
[1205.82 → 1206.18] Um,
[1206.62 → 1207.62] and I went to it.
[1207.90 → 1209.46] That was the first time I'd ever been to a
[1209.46 → 1209.82] uh,
[1210.02 → 1210.38] um,
[1210.74 → 1212.64] like any kind of conference as an attendee.
[1212.64 → 1214.94] I had gone to SIGGRAPH one time.
[1215.30 → 1215.46] Uh,
[1215.46 → 1215.92] this is great.
[1216.02 → 1217.00] We're filling up the time.
[1217.08 → 1217.74] I'm so happy.
[1217.92 → 1218.22] Okay.
[1218.74 → 1219.10] Uh,
[1219.70 → 1221.12] I went to well past three minutes.
[1221.18 → 1221.46] You're doing,
[1221.68 → 1221.94] I know,
[1221.96 → 1222.60] which is crazy.
[1222.72 → 1224.14] We have a whole episode already.
[1224.50 → 1225.10] This is great.
[1225.32 → 1226.38] I'm so happy right now.
[1226.42 → 1226.78] Okay.
[1227.60 → 1228.28] Because like I said,
[1228.40 → 1229.28] the origin story is done.
[1229.38 → 1230.18] We got nothing left.
[1230.30 → 1230.88] So we're on tangent.
[1230.88 → 1232.02] We're still originating.
[1232.26 → 1233.14] This is origin.
[1233.68 → 1236.12] This is pre when you started streaming Casey.
[1236.12 → 1237.36] So this is part of the origin.
[1237.62 → 1238.48] When I was a kid,
[1239.14 → 1240.64] I wanted to go to SIGGRAPH.
[1240.84 → 1241.88] I was a little kid.
[1242.20 → 1242.44] Right.
[1243.00 → 1243.78] And SIGGRAPH,
[1243.92 → 1245.04] like we talked about last time,
[1245.12 → 1246.70] special interest groups for graphics,
[1246.86 → 1247.08] right?
[1247.08 → 1249.84] It's the ACM subdivision where they do graphic stuff.
[1249.84 → 1253.90] And we know the mostly by the big SIGGRAPH,
[1254.02 → 1254.66] uh,
[1254.66 → 1256.42] conference proceedings that they would print.
[1256.56 → 1259.46] That is like where all the new graphics research shows up.
[1259.46 → 1259.82] Right.
[1260.84 → 1261.24] And,
[1261.24 → 1261.62] uh,
[1261.64 → 1261.78] it,
[1261.88 → 1263.02] and in that era,
[1263.02 → 1264.10] they only had one.
[1264.28 → 1265.62] I believe now they have multiple,
[1265.62 → 1266.88] like they have a SIGGRAPH Asia,
[1267.00 → 1267.46] for example.
[1267.46 → 1267.90] I know,
[1267.98 → 1268.26] uh,
[1268.26 → 1269.62] I don't follow it as close as I used to.
[1269.66 → 1270.56] I just read the papers.
[1270.56 → 1272.32] I don't even really remember where they,
[1272.36 → 1273.64] but I just remember now I see like,
[1273.66 → 1273.76] Oh,
[1273.76 → 1274.34] there's SIGGRAPH,
[1274.42 → 1275.46] SIGGRAPH Asia and stuff like that.
[1275.46 → 1275.72] So there's,
[1275.80 → 1277.74] there's more now at that time.
[1277.74 → 1279.78] There was only one big conference a year that,
[1279.84 → 1284.82] it was the big one that everyone went to and other things were smaller, and it was in Boston.
[1285.46 → 1287.04] And of course I lived in Massachusetts.
[1287.04 → 1288.94] So it was in Boston one year, and I'm like,
[1289.00 → 1290.16] I want to go to this.
[1290.36 → 1291.70] I want to go to SIGGRAPH,
[1291.86 → 1298.40] but they had a rule and I have no idea why you cannot attend SIGGRAPH.
[1298.54 → 1302.30] If you're like under 16 or under 18 or something.
[1302.36 → 1303.10] So I didn't,
[1303.26 → 1305.00] I didn't make the age cutoff.
[1305.26 → 1305.94] Good rule.
[1305.94 → 1306.86] Now,
[1309.12 → 1310.22] who is this preventing?
[1310.34 → 1311.04] I don't know if kids,
[1311.24 → 1314.32] maybe it's just to prevent parents from bringing their kids who aren't interested in graphics.
[1314.68 → 1314.96] But I mean,
[1315.00 → 1317.22] like if some 14-year-old or something shows up,
[1317.26 → 1318.48] who's so interested in graphics,
[1318.58 → 1321.70] they want to sit around and listen to people talk about paper presentations all day.
[1321.80 → 1322.68] You're going to tell them,
[1322.76 → 1322.92] no,
[1322.98 → 1323.72] they can't come in.
[1323.74 → 1324.20] I have no idea.
[1324.60 → 1325.70] Maybe it was an insurance thing.
[1325.80 → 1326.40] I don't know.
[1326.44 → 1326.90] But point being,
[1326.90 → 1330.52] they wouldn't let you into anything other than like the expo floor.
[1330.52 → 1333.02] So you could buy an expo ticket,
[1333.22 → 1333.46] right?
[1333.60 → 1336.42] But you couldn't actually go to any of the real stuff.
[1336.84 → 1341.64] But my dad being nice just took me to that anyway.
[1342.06 → 1343.68] And we could do that.
[1343.74 → 1345.36] And we got to see the film and video show,
[1345.48 → 1346.76] which is the other thing you could get into.
[1346.76 → 1349.02] If you're under their age limit,
[1349.02 → 1353.44] the film and video show back in those days was really effing cool as well,
[1353.44 → 1360.80] because it's all the like reels that all the graphics researchers are putting together to show the cool stuff that they've been doing.
[1360.80 → 1361.22] Right.
[1361.62 → 1362.34] And so,
[1362.48 → 1363.02] for example,
[1363.02 → 1366.92] if you have ever seen the Pixar short knick-knack,
[1367.06 → 1370.70] it's about this little snowman who gets trapped in a snow globe.
[1371.06 → 1371.76] I don't know if you've.
[1371.92 → 1373.30] I think I've seen that one.
[1373.54 → 1374.70] I think I've seen it a long time ago.
[1374.70 → 1376.10] They now put them out on their like things.
[1376.20 → 1376.30] Right.
[1376.32 → 1376.78] Cause there's like,
[1376.90 → 1377.94] there was tin toy.
[1378.24 → 1378.68] Right.
[1378.88 → 1381.44] And there was a red's dream.
[1381.62 → 1383.36] And then there's knick-knack.
[1384.12 → 1384.56] Anyway,
[1384.76 → 1386.84] Pixar hadn't made any movies yet.
[1386.92 → 1387.34] Right.
[1387.72 → 1389.90] All they did was make advertisements.
[1390.22 → 1397.28] And then part of their ramp up to trying to make a feature length film was they were doing these shorts.
[1397.48 → 1397.92] Right.
[1397.96 → 1400.06] And every year at the film and video show,
[1400.14 → 1402.62] they would have a new one a lot of times.
[1402.62 → 1402.90] Right.
[1402.92 → 1404.84] Maybe not every year is a bit of an overstatement,
[1404.98 → 1408.26] but so I got to see the premiere of knick-knack,
[1408.36 → 1410.58] which was the first time that short had ever been shown.
[1410.72 → 1412.78] And so I was pretty psyched about that too.
[1412.78 → 1413.10] Anyway,
[1413.40 → 1413.62] blah,
[1413.68 → 1413.78] blah,
[1413.82 → 1413.94] blah.
[1415.06 → 1417.64] So I had gone to that.
[1417.78 → 1419.32] That's the only time I've ever been to a convention.
[1419.54 → 1420.50] I wasn't an attendee.
[1420.60 → 1422.14] I didn't get to go to any of the technical stuff.
[1422.50 → 1426.72] So the first time I'm ever able to go to a real convention is the CGDC,
[1426.90 → 1427.56] which I think was in,
[1427.64 → 1428.82] it was 96 or 97.
[1428.94 → 1430.00] I don't remember which one it was.
[1430.00 → 1430.80] Uh,
[1430.80 → 1431.96] uh,
[1431.96 → 1439.70] and I went there, and it was like super amazing because every single person there pretty much at that time.
[1439.70 → 1439.84] I mean,
[1439.86 → 1441.10] that's an exaggeration,
[1441.10 → 1447.30] but like almost everyone I interacted with was like super serious about game programming.
[1447.30 → 1447.88] Right.
[1447.88 → 1452.24] And there's people walking by that are people like I knew who they were.
[1452.40 → 1452.74] Right.
[1452.74 → 1453.60] It's like,
[1453.64 → 1454.66] Oh crap.
[1454.70 → 1456.68] Like that's like David Jones.
[1456.78 → 1457.88] He's the guy who made,
[1457.90 → 1458.22] uh,
[1458.22 → 1460.04] so no one's going to know this reference,
[1460.04 → 1463.30] but he used to do a lot of programming on like the Amiga,
[1463.30 → 1464.08] uh,
[1464.08 → 1466.16] and Atari ST,
[1466.32 → 1468.52] I think he made a program called music X.
[1468.80 → 1471.40] And he also made this thing called the fairy tale adventure,
[1471.40 → 1474.58] which was a really cool adventure game for its time.
[1474.68 → 1475.44] Super awesome.
[1475.50 → 1476.10] You can look it up.
[1476.70 → 1477.10] Uh,
[1477.22 → 1477.84] and like,
[1477.84 → 1479.14] I know who these guys are.
[1479.16 → 1479.46] I'm like,
[1479.52 → 1479.90] Holy cow.
[1479.94 → 1480.58] Like that's this dude.
[1480.60 → 1481.24] And that's this dude.
[1481.32 → 1485.22] And so it felt kind of crazy because when you're there,
[1485.22 → 1485.66] it's like,
[1485.72 → 1491.54] it's like you're being surrounded by all people who are super into game programming and are all wicked hardcore.
[1491.54 → 1491.92] Right.
[1491.92 → 1493.64] Cause in order to be good at game program at that time,
[1493.64 → 1494.86] you had to know so much stuff.
[1494.86 → 1495.12] Right.
[1496.12 → 1496.46] And,
[1496.56 → 1496.78] uh,
[1496.90 → 1497.68] and so anyway,
[1498.28 → 1498.50] you know,
[1498.50 → 1499.12] you fast-forward today,
[1499.14 → 1500.32] I don't even bother going to the GDC.
[1500.50 → 1501.04] Because I'm just like,
[1501.06 → 1502.78] it's just this corporate nonsense fest.
[1502.78 → 1504.08] Like most of the people there don't,
[1504.16 → 1505.44] they just want to make money or whatever,
[1505.44 → 1506.62] or they're just like getting,
[1506.74 → 1507.34] I have,
[1507.40 → 1511.10] I have like the most cynical possible view of something like that.
[1511.16 → 1513.06] Now that I don't even care.
[1513.06 → 1514.88] I don't even look at to proceed,
[1515.16 → 1516.20] at the proceedings.
[1516.20 → 1518.08] Like I don't even look at what the talks are.
[1518.12 → 1518.28] Right.
[1519.66 → 1520.06] So,
[1520.06 → 1520.50] uh,
[1520.50 → 1523.34] it felt going to BSC kind of felt like that.
[1523.64 → 1524.58] And,
[1524.58 → 1524.98] uh,
[1524.98 → 1529.24] it felt like that early version where everyone's super hardcore, and you're just excited.
[1529.24 → 1529.76] And like,
[1529.76 → 1531.64] you come back from it being like,
[1531.74 → 1532.22] Holy cow,
[1532.26 → 1532.88] this is awesome.
[1532.88 → 1534.30] Like programming is awesome again.
[1534.86 → 1535.44] So anyway,
