[0.00 --> 3.84]  Welcome to the startup today we have on with us we have teach say hi teach
[3.84 --> 12.56]  Hi teach all right uh we got casey muratore hello everyone and we got dhh the race car driver himself
[12.56 --> 21.94]  all righty so by the way today we got a good topic topic is should you go to college
[21.94 --> 26.86]  i thought the topic was is college worth it that's a different that's a different question
[26.86 --> 33.68]  the topic is is college worth it nailed the intro he's got it first try right here all right
[33.68 --> 43.06]  uh anyway sorry it is college worth it hey david you are on the show for the first time so why don't
[43.06 --> 51.40]  you kick us off is college worth it and as the only non-american well is it worth what is it worth
[51.40 --> 56.84]  10 grand yeah i think it's worth 10 grand is it worth a quarter of a million dollars in debt
[56.84 --> 62.88]  absolutely not unless you're guaranteed to be raking it in when you get out on the other side
[62.88 --> 70.60]  i think the weirdness of all of this is coming from denmark where the state will pay for your
[70.60 --> 77.20]  college education the state will spend like last i looked it up i think it was something like 10 grand
[77.20 --> 86.42]  to educate you so to hear that people go to college where you can spend 90 000 a year for a
[86.42 --> 92.04]  four-year degree and i think that's even without room and board just sounds insane i don't understand
[92.04 --> 99.40]  why americans married the idea of getting education with getting a four-year cruise like why did that
[99.40 --> 106.32]  have to be the same thing oh you also get a five-star hotel thrown in and by the way you gotta pay for it
[106.32 --> 111.66]  for the rest of your life that just seems insane to me not the idea that you have to or should get
[111.66 --> 116.68]  an education if you're so inclined to get high education but that you're gonna pay a ridiculous
[116.68 --> 123.52]  ungodly sum for it that you're gonna carry on your back for the next 10 15 20 years is there any
[123.52 --> 128.86]  education that's worth it that is worth the 250 000 like is there some role that it's like okay it's fine
[128.86 --> 133.08]  because is it purely just because you're gonna make money is that your argument like so like a doctor
[133.08 --> 136.30]  doctors come out they spend obviously hundreds of thousands of dollars because they have to go to
[136.30 --> 141.74]  you know college for eight to ten years just like me but i'm not a doctor and uh like does that is
[141.74 --> 146.56]  that the same thing are you okay with that because you know they're gonna make a lot i think that's
[146.56 --> 153.30]  at least a financial sort of situation that can make sense i know in denmark there are educations where
[153.30 --> 158.16]  you spend a lot if you want to become a pilot that's really expensive and you normally take on
[158.16 --> 163.98]  some sort of loan agreement or you sometimes take something on with the military you're going to do this
[163.98 --> 169.98]  amount of years of service and they're going to teach you how to become a pilot but in the u.s this
[169.98 --> 178.20]  idea that you can spend four years learning russian poetry and that's going to cost you 100 grand 200
[178.20 --> 183.78]  grand 50 grand 20 grand like on the other side like what the fuck are you going to do how are you going
[183.78 --> 190.84]  to make that money back i think it's just absolutely mind-blowingly insane that there's a system set up
[190.84 --> 195.36]  where the loans are backed by the government which means that there's no skin in the game for
[195.36 --> 203.14]  neither the lenders nor the educational institutions to actually produce something that will create a
[203.14 --> 209.56]  return that someone is going to spend a proportionate amount on the education as to what they're going to
[209.56 --> 215.16]  get out of it from a job and i i mean i'm not even against russian poetry i think there should be
[215.16 --> 221.56]  people who study that but they should be perhaps encouraged to take on an obscene amount of debt
[221.56 --> 229.12]  for prospects that just aren't there to ever ever pay it off in the end and i think that's really what
[229.12 --> 235.76]  just fires me up about all this stuff is that the economics is so warped and it all seems to hinge on
[235.76 --> 241.38]  this idea that like well if we can just convince uh i don't know a president to forgive all the loans
[241.38 --> 248.16]  without changing a damn thing about how the system works somehow that's going to be good no no the
[248.16 --> 252.58]  fundamentally flawed part is that there is there's no skin in the game for the lenders there's no skin
[252.58 --> 259.02]  in the game for the universities and there's just a bunch of 18 year olds being asked whether they
[259.02 --> 266.12]  would like free money to take a four-year fucking cruise to come out of the other side with a degree
[266.12 --> 274.80]  in russian poetry that's going to pay 22 000 a year like what the why why are you doing this to kids
[274.80 --> 282.66]  i think that borders into something that's morally reprehensible even if you can say like well you knew
[282.66 --> 288.18]  you signed on the dotted line you could have read the it's not even fine print i mean you actually do
[288.18 --> 292.92]  have to be slightly retarded to think that you can take on two hundred thousand dollars or hundred
[292.92 --> 298.02]  thousand dollars worth of debt and that that degree in russian poetry is somehow going to work
[298.02 --> 301.98]  out but you know what that's what 17 year olds are that's what 18 year olds are they're retarded
[301.98 --> 307.42]  in the sense that they're like their brains are not literally not fully formed i think the the female
[307.42 --> 314.74]  brain formed a little earlier the male brain 25 that's by the time in my experience there's still
[314.74 --> 321.86]  sometimes a little time left to cook even after 25 so i think it's just i mean it's just a really bad
[321.86 --> 332.20]  construct to entice kids to take on these massive loan burdens with the entire pressure of a society
[332.20 --> 337.70]  telling them that if they don't go to college and preferably if they don't go to a prestige college
[337.70 --> 342.48]  they're fucked right like their life is over they they're never going to make any money they're going
[342.48 --> 347.90]  to be a loser which by the way isn't true there are plenty of losers who finished their four-year
[347.90 --> 353.92]  degree and again saddled with a bunch of debt and can't get a job and like that's a fair definition
[353.92 --> 358.70]  of a loser in fact it's a worse definition of a loser than someone who doesn't go through all that
[358.70 --> 366.02]  and at least doesn't have the debt burden right but this idea that we've shuffled all kind of societal
[366.02 --> 370.62]  pressures towards you have to get a college degree because hey look at the statistics over time blah blah
[370.62 --> 378.54]  yeah also we need some welders we need some carpenters we need a bunch of other professions
[378.54 --> 386.22]  to keep society fucking running and some of them can be quite lucrative right so even just for an
[386.22 --> 391.92]  individual there is something really screwed up about how the encouragement system goes i think uh
[391.92 --> 399.64]  mike wrote and the whole 30 jobs things and so on i is absolutely spot on in my optics um but all right
[399.64 --> 404.34]  not everyone wants to be a welder and and some folks should go to college we should also have a
[404.34 --> 412.24]  bunch of educated people we don't need to take that a desire and a need for education and marry it to a
[412.24 --> 419.52]  luxury cruise that's going to cost an obscene amount of money developers are you tired of code reviews that

[457.54 --> 463.88]  dash vs code links in the description and ship cleaner code today you bring up a really good point
[463.88 --> 467.40]  which is these 18 year olds can make a decision that's going to cost them hundreds of thousands
[467.40 --> 470.84]  of dollars but they can't even buy alcohol because we think they're not responsible enough to be able to
[470.84 --> 475.62]  drink alcohol which is kind of like a really funny kind of world we live in where it's just like oh yeah
[475.62 --> 480.30]  they totally get a life decision that's going to saddle them with debt for the for the next 20 potential
[480.30 --> 486.30]  years of their life but hey you can't rent a car yet honestly you're not you're not capable to run
[486.30 --> 491.64]  to rent a car but hey you can definitely make this decision like one is way worse than the other one
[491.64 --> 496.46]  and it's just far more impactful that's actually that's why the the car company doesn't want to
[496.46 --> 500.96]  let them rent a car because they know they're going to make bad decisions and the car company is going
[500.96 --> 509.38]  the game the one yes if if that 18 year old crashes the car and the company renting them
[509.38 --> 514.30]  can't recoup that money because the fucking 18 year old doesn't have any they know you know what
[514.30 --> 518.90]  that wouldn't be smart i should not rent this person my car because they're going to crash it and i won't
[518.90 --> 523.68]  be able to get my money back therefore i'm not going to do it and i think that's by the way at the
[523.68 --> 530.00]  root of all this is good intentions the good intention that if we underwrite the loans the student loans
[530.00 --> 535.66]  more people have access to loans which means that more people will have access to education
[535.66 --> 541.30]  and zero consideration has been taken to like the second order effect what happens when there's just
[541.30 --> 546.76]  free unbacked money with no skin in the game yeah prices are going to go to the moon and who's going
[546.76 --> 554.24]  to vacuum all all the excess capital administrators you've seen the graph right like since whatever 1960
[554.24 --> 562.36]  complete flat line with uh professors and educators and adjuncts and then you see from 1980 forward the
[562.36 --> 569.36]  chart just goes parabolical when you look at administrators i what was the the stat something
[569.36 --> 575.54]  like some college had a 10 to 1 ratio of admins to students or something just truly bizarre it might
[575.54 --> 579.08]  have been columbia i think or something yeah i remember seeing something like that yeah
[579.08 --> 583.60]  and you just make any sense that can't be real there can't be a hundred thousand administrators
[583.60 --> 588.98]  he's not really exaggerating i don't remember the exact for it either but like there were there
[588.98 --> 594.66]  were numbers that would be absurd right i remember it being i'm gonna fucking ask it yeah it's there
[594.66 --> 600.70]  was more ridiculous than you think our number yeah it had to be like administrators to professors
[600.70 --> 605.94]  for every single professor there's 10 administrators because students would just be just would be the
[605.94 --> 608.96]  most ridiculous yeah it was it was something like 10 to 1 but it was like one-to-one with students
[608.96 --> 613.42]  it was like it was like the same number or something maybe it was insane okay which also it's like
[613.42 --> 617.40]  having a company and you have more managers than employees like everybody's walking around like
[617.40 --> 626.92]  we're managing oh no here it is thanks thanks uh chat gpt uh at yale 5,460 administrators
[626.92 --> 635.64]  managing fewer than 5,000 undergraduate students more than a one-to-one ratio what what you don't think
[635.64 --> 640.42]  you're paying for that you don't think you're paying for that uh hall monitor like all the time
[640.42 --> 645.30]  just dedicated to you and only you it'd be one thing too if they like literally followed you around
[645.30 --> 651.34]  they're like yo we're gonna we have a person whose sole job is they're gonna follow you for four years
[651.34 --> 655.54]  yeah we're gonna optimize everything about your life we're gonna get you in the best classes i'm
[655.54 --> 659.76]  gonna be reaching out to people to get you internships i'm gonna be like yeah your personal
[659.76 --> 664.36]  assistant your gail personal assistant right and also like it gets drunk for you like whoever that
[664.36 --> 668.42]  person is they get drunk for you they get in fights for you they date for you all the stuff
[668.42 --> 673.88]  and then you just get the outcome whatever it is at the end of it imagine you could just be like hey
[673.88 --> 680.62]  can you ask out the personal assistant of so and so over there and we can sort of figure out if we're a
[680.62 --> 685.56]  match and then like we'll go on a date i'm too busy studying and working hard but it sounds like
[685.56 --> 690.26]  what are these people doing absolutely what are these people fucking doing well first of all they're
[690.26 --> 697.18]  making your life fucking miserable 100 the college experience that had a one-on-one ratio of admins to
[697.18 --> 704.80]  students is infinitely worse than the experience of 1967 that had 100 students to one administrator
[704.80 --> 710.80]  whatever the ratio used to be 100 that experience is worth worse and i think i mean for me the great
[710.80 --> 717.48]  illustration of this was during covid where student was just treated like cattle in a cage and you're
[717.48 --> 721.82]  thinking like wait what people are paying for this they're paying for this fucking experience they
[721.82 --> 728.90]  don't even get to go to classes they don't even get to have the joy of that four-year uh cruise they get
[728.90 --> 734.78]  to be confined into a dorm and then there's an administrator that's gonna run around and yell at them if
[734.78 --> 742.32]  they walk outside without a mask on well what are you doing this is insane and then like did they not
[742.32 --> 748.88]  just admit like yeah well i know you guys didn't really learn anything this semester so everyone
[748.88 --> 753.28]  just gets an a they didn't even like pretend at the end of the semester like i had younger siblings
[753.28 --> 759.48]  in college like during covid and they're like we just didn't do anything and you're like what do you
[759.48 --> 763.70]  you still got the grade you didn't have to like repeat or anything oh yeah i got a check for that you're
[763.70 --> 769.08]  like what that's i didn't even know that was a thing that that is that's crazy that's like the okay
[769.08 --> 773.18]  so i can't tell what is the worst part about or the best part about college whether it's the actual
[773.18 --> 778.46]  education or the fact that you're going through college with people approximately your age learning
[778.46 --> 782.90]  the same topic and being able to kind of learn how to argue with each other and really become a full
[782.90 --> 789.16]  formed adult and all that if you're not even going to school or class during that time and you didn't
[789.16 --> 792.90]  get to be around other people like the whole entire college experience doesn't make any sense this is
[792.90 --> 797.84]  also my whole problem with remote education they're really there's a big push into like remotify all
[797.84 --> 803.52]  aspects of life and it's just like how why would you ever pay to go to a university when like the
[803.52 --> 809.26]  true value of a university is in the moments of being around people and learning in some sort of
[809.26 --> 815.30]  co kind of way like those were those were single-handedly my best experiences in college and really where i
[815.30 --> 821.50]  learned how to become actually a good programmer was at was the after labs after hours arguing about an
[821.50 --> 826.22]  acm programming competition figuring out how to solve the coin change problem because none of us were ever
[826.22 --> 830.94]  able to do it and there was no just chat gpt to spit out an answer it's like that's where the magic was
[830.94 --> 838.48]  well i would actually argue like one one greater or one more severe than that i guess i would say which
[838.48 --> 846.60]  is that college what it really is as far as i've been able to determine is like a institution that is
[846.60 --> 855.96]  extracting money from you while getting the value from you so it's basically a a strictly one-sided thing
[855.96 --> 860.90]  all of the students who come together they're actually the value like you interacting with
[860.90 --> 865.96]  the other students and stuff like that and being there and you know going through the process
[865.96 --> 872.10]  is valuable to you and valuable to the other students because of each other but the actual
[872.10 --> 877.76]  education you're receiving is usually not very good compared to that right and compared to the other
[877.76 --> 883.32]  you know resources that you now have available for learning things and the reason that i think that's
[883.32 --> 887.74]  somewhat like the reason i think there's a reasonable amount of evidence for that is just
[887.74 --> 893.56]  because people right now are doing stuff like using chat gpt to cheat on their papers or whatever right
[893.56 --> 899.00]  and all this sort of stuff if you were going there for the education you would never cheat because
[899.00 --> 904.18]  that's like paying for something and then not taking the thing right that's like buying a car and
[904.18 --> 908.52]  saying oh keep the car i'm gonna walk it's kind of like getting a gym membership and never going to the gym
[908.52 --> 913.72]  so we know we know like basically it's like no the thing what you were getting was whatever was
[913.72 --> 917.68]  happening with you and the other students that's the thing and the credential at the end is the part
[917.68 --> 923.74]  that you actually cared about and wanted to pay for but the the education even can't be that good
[923.74 --> 927.22]  because people aren't even mad when they don't get it or like with covid people are probably like
[927.22 --> 932.74]  sweet i didn't have to read all the books for that class i just got the a for free that would never
[932.74 --> 936.64]  happen if you felt like the thing you were getting was really valuable right you would never do that
[936.64 --> 941.86]  you'd be like oh my god i object like i want those classes back i need to study that particular piece
[941.86 --> 947.96]  of russian poetry and you didn't let me do that right yeah i want to inject one thing which is the
[947.96 --> 953.16]  reason why that's true is because these kids are retarded in the same way we just talked about they're
[953.16 --> 959.54]  retarded taking on 200 grand worth of student loan debt right they're not literally they their brains are
[959.54 --> 965.74]  not formed they are forming that is what the university college experience is supposed to do right
[965.74 --> 970.80]  but in that moment no they don't have that i didn't have that i mean i was always thrilled
[970.80 --> 978.24]  whenever class was canceled i was like sweet um so they're not thinking long term because literally
[978.24 --> 983.12]  the brain is not done with the part that does long-term thinking so when you're asking them like
[983.12 --> 988.54]  hey do you know what maybe you should study because who's going to care about this diploma by the way
[988.54 --> 994.60]  not a lot do by the time you get into say uh programming if you're getting a diploma for
[994.60 --> 1001.00]  for programming and you don't know how to program that diploma ain't worth shit right there's a status
[1001.00 --> 1008.20]  token in that diploma that may open some doors may give you an opportunity may give you an audition
[1008.20 --> 1014.00]  you still gotta fucking act you still gotta be able to do the thing i mean it's all good that you can
[1014.00 --> 1020.16]  apply and you'll make the first cut uh of the recruiter sorting oh this person went to yale like
[1020.16 --> 1024.98]  let's make sure that they are in the second round of this shit and then you're gonna be at the whiteboard
[1024.98 --> 1029.94]  and then fucking what what are you gonna do you don't know anything because you just coasted through
[1029.94 --> 1036.56]  everything you spend an enormous amount of money for a status token that's gonna be revealed in a
[1036.56 --> 1042.88]  second to be worth nothing now i don't know how it works in i don't know investment banking
[1042.88 --> 1047.90]  maybe the status token there kind of opened some doors and everyone is full of shit in investment
[1047.90 --> 1052.44]  banking you don't have to know anything i mean that's the stereotype programmers would like to
[1052.44 --> 1056.02]  believe about finance people i think or maybe management or something you go into management
[1056.02 --> 1061.16]  consulting but also i mean government i don't actually think that's true i do think you'll you
[1061.16 --> 1067.16]  gotta have some smarts to it right so i think you're exactly right it's an awful deal awful deal
[1067.16 --> 1072.84]  to pay way too much even if it has something of value it's an even worse deal to pay all that money
[1072.84 --> 1079.06]  for something of zero value and i think again that's part of the that's why kids go to school
[1079.06 --> 1085.30]  because they don't fucking know anything or everything they have so i think they do i remember
[1085.30 --> 1091.04]  oh right i remember knowing everything dh okay and i mean that by the way that does have value right
[1091.04 --> 1095.56]  like ignorance i'm actually a big fan of when it comes to a lot of things it has to be backed by
[1095.56 --> 1101.48]  some degree of competence or at least a trajectory towards competence but if you have those things
[1101.48 --> 1107.42]  ignorance is great right like it allows you to not know how hard it's going to be and you're going
[1107.42 --> 1111.94]  to start and you're going to be delusional about how big it's going to be and you know what maybe it
[1111.94 --> 1117.78]  will be right like i started my uh programming adventure when i was 20 something well before my
[1117.78 --> 1125.64]  prefrontal cortex was fully formed so i'm not against that i mean i think what what you said about
[1125.64 --> 1132.56]  how wonderful these years can be how formative they can be it 100 has value 100 something that
[1132.56 --> 1138.16]  i'd say anyone who's sort of cognitively inclined to pursue higher education should try to get
[1138.16 --> 1144.84]  but why would you pick the most expensive version of that right so you know what i'm going to make a
[1144.84 --> 1151.34]  computer parallel here i've been testing these mini pcs right and i bought this mini pc that's
[1151.34 --> 1161.98]  313 from minis forum 313 i'm like holy shit i i make a lot of money i should just buy it the best
[1161.98 --> 1167.14]  right i buy this thing for 313 and like i fucking can't tell the difference i have a two thousand
[1167.14 --> 1172.60]  dollar computer next to it and a four thousand computer four thousand dollar computer next to that
[1172.60 --> 1180.16]  i can't tell the difference like if you're not just money is unlimited you're a retard if you buy the
[1180.16 --> 1183.82]  four thousand dollar computer if the three hundred and third or the thirteen dollar computer can do
[1183.82 --> 1189.92]  which that's how i look at american education like hey if you just do in-state if you just do in-state
[1189.92 --> 1196.62]  like what 80 of it is paid for yeah whatever the state rate is something like six seven eight grand
[1196.62 --> 1200.98]  or something seven grand a year for me it's a lot closer to the denmark model if you go in-state
[1200.98 --> 1209.50]  exactly exactly because it's closer to just like sheer cost why would anyone who does not have the
[1209.50 --> 1217.18]  money just to throw around go into debt to get essentially the same product right like i understand
[1217.18 --> 1221.32]  there can be differences between colleges but for most people getting most educations like you know
[1221.32 --> 1225.98]  what if you're not really going to class or trying to learn and you're just using you're going for the
[1225.98 --> 1231.60]  sort of the social experience and all that good stuff that's great but i think it's just
[1231.60 --> 1241.56]  there's a weird um prestige luxury product aspect of this that is just so actually repulsive in many
[1241.56 --> 1246.72]  ways when you think about what it is and what the consequences of it is like do you know what if you
[1246.72 --> 1254.48]  can afford to spend uh twenty thousand dollars on a watch and you just it's nothing to you great like
[1254.48 --> 1262.86]  do it yeah i've done that great i i that's the spoils of having succeeded in some ways if you're
[1262.86 --> 1267.08]  spending twenty thousand dollars on a watch and you're making like forty five and forty five thousand
[1267.08 --> 1273.84]  a year again you're a retard what are you doing that no the casio which by the way casio makes some
[1273.84 --> 1280.26]  sweet ass watches one of my favorite watches is an eighteen dollar casio right where you pay twenty
[1280.26 --> 1286.98]  grand it tells the time worse it's a luxury item for people where money at that scale just doesn't
[1286.98 --> 1291.26]  matter right it's the same thing with education like don't don't do the out of the state thing
[1291.26 --> 1296.98]  unless your parents are paying for it unless there's some direct line where you can just see like all
[1296.98 --> 1302.96]  right if i do this it's gonna open that door i want to work at whatever jp morgan or some other
[1302.96 --> 1311.62]  company where i know the huddle goes through yale or some other status token uh anyone else yeah it's
[1311.62 --> 1319.56]  just dumb so i guess i can can we put some blame on the industry here though because i feel like if if
[1319.56 --> 1325.34]  the industry at large like let's say like you know a couple of these big companies you know amazon
[1325.34 --> 1330.44]  microsoft google whoever if they actually came out and said we're not going to look at college degrees
[1330.44 --> 1335.10]  anymore period like hr is not going to use them for screening they're not going to get handed to
[1335.10 --> 1340.60]  the interviewer we're just they're off the resume we just white it out and send it on i think that
[1340.60 --> 1347.48]  would have a major effect like overnight on whether or not people because there probably are nowadays
[1347.48 --> 1352.18]  especially with thanks to the internet and youtube and all these things where people can hear more
[1352.18 --> 1358.44]  opinions they get more information they can access other things i do think people would be like oh cool
[1358.44 --> 1363.82]  all right awesome then i'll just study on my own or i'll just work with some other people you know
[1363.82 --> 1367.32]  in a study group on the internet and i'll learn programming and i'll and i'll do this sort of stuff
[1367.32 --> 1373.00]  and then i know i won't be disadvantaged when i go to apply to one of these jobs but the reality is that
[1373.00 --> 1377.06]  the hr departments who by the way none of them have any idea what programming is or how it works
[1377.06 --> 1381.72]  at all right i can just tell you this like they have no idea what a good programmer looks like none
[1381.72 --> 1387.68]  right they still use to do first pass screening and things like this they will use things like
[1387.68 --> 1392.22]  cs degrees and i've checked that recently like i've asked people at companies like that you know is
[1392.22 --> 1399.54]  that slab and it is and so i feel like we're we are to blame to some degree for still using this like
[1399.54 --> 1406.48]  expense plus attrition plus whatever you want to call the like filtering process that college is
[1406.48 --> 1411.62]  like could you grind through four years of having to listen to professors who themselves don't know how to
[1411.62 --> 1417.42]  tell you stuff and then still get through that after and pay eighty thousand dollars if you can
[1417.42 --> 1423.50]  maybe you're more slightly more likely to be a good employee for us so we're gonna make you all do that
[1423.50 --> 1428.70]  first if we could get rid of that if we if we took it among ourselves to get rid of that i think it
[1428.70 --> 1432.72]  would be a much better world but the industry isn't they're still doing that because there's a little
[1432.72 --> 1437.02]  bit of signal there i think probably right i think you're also i think there is we're confusing a
[1437.02 --> 1441.54]  little bit which is that there was a time in computer science when it was just computer science and
[1441.54 --> 1447.00]  programming was like the expression of computer science it's just like hey google we're doctorates
[1447.00 --> 1452.44]  we're researching better search algorithms oh wow we started a company hey we are a bunch of doctors
[1452.44 --> 1456.58]  and now we need to get other people to help us with this we should hire other doctors right like
[1456.58 --> 1461.08]  there's this actual computer science giving birth to something that was a product but most of the
[1461.08 --> 1466.18]  things that are happening today are more akin to a trades job like hey i need you to sit down and i need
[1466.18 --> 1470.60]  you to go to the pixel mines and swing that like pickaxe for the next eight hours to kind of just
[1470.60 --> 1474.78]  make some sort of progress on our product and then i want you to go home and then i'm going to call you
[1474.78 --> 1478.86]  at two in the morning when everything crashes and burns like that's what you're doing it's a 99 trade job
[1478.86 --> 1484.64]  it's a one percent like educational job whereas i think if you went backwards in time you would see
[1484.64 --> 1490.98]  much more hey this is closer related to research than it is uh closer related to a trades job and so i think
[1490.98 --> 1496.52]  there's a we're in this weird shift where we still have all the holding backs of the previous time
[1496.52 --> 1500.22]  and now we're in this kind of trades job because i'm sure there was other times that where this
[1500.22 --> 1505.22]  existed in other industries i'm sure it has happened but right now i that's right i mean i think that's
[1505.22 --> 1510.60]  why education is still accidentally important is that we still have this hold back it i mean i can go
[1510.60 --> 1516.80]  backwards in time i was born in 1976 and no you can go back it never was like it like there was never a
[1516.80 --> 1522.66]  time when the putting you know when actually dealing with the reality of computing didn't
[1522.66 --> 1529.26]  require the trades job part mostly like in fact if anything back then it was like if you weren't
[1529.26 --> 1533.18]  programming a semi-language you probably weren't really going to have a pretty well-functioning
[1533.18 --> 1537.80]  product right whereas nowadays no one does that right i mean not no one the ffm peg team does
[1537.80 --> 1542.94]  right yeah and occasionally some of the people at rad game tools or whatever but everyone else right
[1542.94 --> 1547.46]  we write in something at least slightly higher even if we're doing performance stuff usually
[1547.46 --> 1551.70]  so i would say actually going back in time there was even less of an argument for cs
[1551.70 --> 1556.76]  yes it was a valuable thing to have a few people working on it you know you wanted your new dikstra's
[1556.76 --> 1561.58]  and stuff like that doing work because we want to know stuff like how do we do shortest path
[1561.58 --> 1566.62]  algorithms or things like that but generally speaking that's a very small number of people and you
[1566.62 --> 1572.42]  usually don't need very many of those people if any to make a software product even then you didn't need
[1572.42 --> 1576.62]  that many of those people to make a software product i would i i'd like to convince my man
[1576.62 --> 1580.26]  the other side for a second because there's too much agreement here and i don't like yes go for
[1580.26 --> 1588.00]  yeah go for it um do you know what i believe the 10x programmer is 100 real perhaps even an
[1588.00 --> 1594.10]  understatement because remember the 10x programmer is not saying that the best program is 10 times
[1594.10 --> 1597.70]  better than the average programmer it's saying that the best program is 10 times better than the
[1597.70 --> 1603.72]  worst programmer i think that it's a vast understatement i think it's probably the 100x
[1603.72 --> 1608.66]  programmer is true or maybe even the thousand x program 10,000 x programmers i've seen some shitty
[1608.66 --> 1614.76]  programs written in my life and i'm like when i've looked at what that output is and i compared it to
[1614.76 --> 1622.80]  the best programs the best programmers i'm like i would not trade 10 of these idiots for one of these
[1622.80 --> 1631.52]  geniuses right well it's genius it's worth way way more so to steal my like what if and i don't fully
[1631.52 --> 1636.44]  believe this but i'm gonna present it anyway what if the kinds of people who can make it through a
[1636.44 --> 1644.46]  harvard cs degree were in the just abstract classical sense before dei bullshit like this was actually the
[1644.46 --> 1651.60]  cream of the crop of the crop right like it was your perfect si sat score individual just like
[1651.60 --> 1659.02]  iq 150 that individual has been filtered through because harvard only has these few spots and like
[1659.02 --> 1665.98]  that they get the very best and then you get to arm that person with a cs degree and you let them loose
[1665.98 --> 1672.56]  on sort of run-of-the-mill software and what they do is they don't just they don't just do the thing
[1672.56 --> 1678.24]  right like they make a machine to build more of the things and that the leverage you get out of a
[1678.24 --> 1685.10]  10 or 100x programmer is actually worth it now i don't actually think this is happening and i don't
[1685.10 --> 1691.14]  even think google knows it's not happening google did this multi-year study on their hiring processes
[1691.14 --> 1696.36]  where they were trying to figure out like what's the signal who ends up doing really well and who
[1696.36 --> 1700.92]  ends up not doing very well they didn't find a signal they couldn't go like oh it's because i have
[1700.92 --> 1705.78]  an mit cheaper icon oh it's because they have this or that but at least the pursuit of it does make
[1705.78 --> 1713.24]  some sense in my mind because i've worked with a lot of programmers in my time and the capacity the
[1713.24 --> 1719.60]  productivity of the very best is just on a completely different plane so i don't i don't disagree that
[1719.60 --> 1724.70]  companies the very best companies the most valuable companies the richest companies in the world
[1724.70 --> 1731.20]  should try to find those because if you do find one they can do things that most people are not
[1731.20 --> 1738.70]  going to do now is your task worthy of that like if you're some regional office for a third tier
[1738.70 --> 1744.28]  rental company and you just need to have your form updated like is that worth the super genius to apply
[1744.28 --> 1752.30]  to that problem probably not right like we need multiple layers of it um but everyone also wants the
[1752.30 --> 1757.76]  best right like they or they want the best that they can get so i don't actually i a little bit
[1757.76 --> 1765.06]  sympathize with the idea that the googles and the fangs and whatever who worth trillions would go like
[1765.06 --> 1771.66]  but think about the cost right this is the way i look at it it's like i i totally want them to be trying
[1771.66 --> 1778.28]  to get the best right and the problem is the college system doesn't do that filtering as far as i can tell
[1778.28 --> 1783.42]  and so what what i would love is if they took it more seriously and went okay how do we build
[1783.42 --> 1790.32]  something because what we know is that you could spend eighty thousand dollars per person
[1790.32 --> 1796.60]  and still come out ahead on that filtering because that's how much harvard or whatever is charging these
[1796.60 --> 1801.66]  people right now i think though it does get uncomfortable okay because if you're like what are the raw
[1801.66 --> 1808.82]  materials okay that's worth that kind of investment okay and i think and i didn't i've i've never taken
[1808.82 --> 1812.88]  an iq test in my life and i'm kind of afraid that if i do one like i'm not gonna like the result just
[1812.88 --> 1817.16]  do three of them you'll score super high you just once you do one you get a higher score every time
[1817.16 --> 1822.32]  i'm thinking 100 still no you take enough of them you'll be like i read this wonderful book about
[1822.32 --> 1827.74]  i went read this wonderful book about um the correlations with iq and like it was actually kind of sort of
[1827.74 --> 1837.68]  depressing because the amount of set trajectories or at least um whatever confidence that originate out
[1837.68 --> 1843.62]  of that point is actually rather great and that means that there are simply there is a hardware
[1843.62 --> 1848.92]  difference right like some people can make up for a lack of hardware with some incredible other
[1848.92 --> 1854.58]  ingenuity but generally speaking if you take mass numbers you need a certain amount of hardware and
[1854.58 --> 1860.88]  that's partly what the sat is it's an iq test by another name um that's what lead code is
[1860.88 --> 1870.94]  lead code is essentially hey here's an iq test or an iq derivative and it sucks but it's going to
[1870.94 --> 1876.48]  produce a signal that at least like this individual has the hardware to perform at the top level because
[1876.48 --> 1884.40]  you know what there's no amount of smart tricks you can do at like 95 like you're not it's just
[1884.40 --> 1891.98]  that's not going to be your profession it's just not it's not there right so i think um this all
[1891.98 --> 1898.82]  these ways we're searching for it to at least find this out of the potentials of the very very best um
[1898.82 --> 1906.42]  tie into that notion that both college the the admission to college and all the rest of it is
[1906.42 --> 1912.46]  essentially trying to suss out like who's the smart cookies again there's a million not not there are many
[1912.46 --> 1917.48]  other variables you're right very few of them are as determined as that one you you have a point
[1917.48 --> 1922.48]  there which is that at least in the u.s i guess companies are sort of prohibited from using
[1922.48 --> 1927.96]  intelligence tests as part of hiring as part of like various sort of civil rights legislations and
[1927.96 --> 1933.28]  things like this i guess i've heard it said anyway i've never actually looked to see what the case law
[1933.28 --> 1939.76]  is on it but that they're not allowed to actually administer something that's roughly like how smart is this
[1939.76 --> 1946.54]  person so yeah they're not right and and so i guess you could say me is you know if we want to be
[1946.54 --> 1951.38]  really blunt about it is this just a legal issue is it like does that just need to go and then it's
[1951.38 --> 1956.86]  like they could put a screening process in place that would allow anyone who could show sufficient
[1956.86 --> 1962.36]  ability to get through it without paying the eighty thousand dollars uh or am i probably master
[1962.36 --> 1965.90]  say it two hundred thousand dollars i don't know what costs go to harvard these days it's probably absurd
[1965.90 --> 1970.44]  i think it's in north and two hundred and why are you using harvard i've actually never met a good
[1970.44 --> 1974.42]  programmer from harvard maybe there are some all my harvard experiences are actually horrible yeah
[1974.42 --> 1980.82]  caltech all the programmers from caltech are unbelievably good right yeah so yeah but so caltech
[1980.82 --> 1987.04]  whatever it is but point being like whatever that cost is i feel like you know you you would want some
[1987.04 --> 1990.80]  way that people could just demonstrate that they're they're good enough and they've studied enough on
[1990.80 --> 1994.68]  their own to get through it without having to go through that whole process that simply isn't
[1994.68 --> 1998.78]  accessible for anyone who doesn't have a lot of money or isn't willing to go into a huge amount
[1998.78 --> 2003.76]  of debt which isn't good but also isn't that i mean and i'm not a fan of it and i fucking hate
[2003.76 --> 2009.14]  algorithm in general right but isn't that what lead code is like lead code essentially if you can
[2009.14 --> 2017.38]  crack the top tiers of that i mean unless you're doing it with ai it is a intelligence test it is a filter
[2017.38 --> 2021.76]  and i think at least from what i've heard from a lot of hiring processes a lot of it has sort of
[2021.76 --> 2027.22]  leaned heavily into that that that becomes a qualifier if you can really smash lead code and
[2027.22 --> 2032.66]  have the tenacity and the time and whatever and the firepower up here between your neurons
[2032.66 --> 2039.18]  to grind it for three months and we're able to do those hards like at the very least maybe you're not
[2039.18 --> 2043.74]  a great programmer which i actually think there's something to that too i met some very very smart
[2043.74 --> 2050.36]  people who are also programmers who i would not want to program my code yeah right correct but but
[2050.36 --> 2056.14]  i mean i'd say on on average you'd rather want a smart person than a not so smart person working
[2056.14 --> 2062.30]  next to you um as a programmer so i think maybe actually the industry what happened with lead code
[2062.30 --> 2068.70]  was some sense of trying to get towards that right can we can we just route around the fact that
[2068.70 --> 2073.82]  universities are actually no longer i should say all that great of a filter like they're broken in
[2073.82 --> 2081.12]  all these ways they're not as meritocratic and as focused on um objective scores as they once were
[2081.12 --> 2085.90]  and therefore they're not a great signal here's another kind of signal which by the way has been
[2085.90 --> 2092.74]  completely blown out of the water right like ai killed lead code right so yes i'm gonna go with an
[2092.74 --> 2099.04]  opposite take on this one which is uh i i don't like the idea of intelligence tests um because i i
[2099.04 --> 2104.18]  think that intelligent tests one thing that they largely lack the ability of is to identify wisdom
[2104.18 --> 2110.08]  in somebody i'd much rather hire a wise not so smart programmer who's going to make the right decision
[2110.08 --> 2115.72]  given enough time than i would to hire the super smart person that can make fast decisions but their
[2115.72 --> 2120.24]  decisions may be incredibly unwise because i always define just for everybody intelligence is the ability
[2120.24 --> 2125.78]  to solve a problem wisdom is the ability to know which problem to solve right like which which one
[2125.78 --> 2131.20]  would you rather have and i i don't think there is a standardized test that's going to be like and
[2131.20 --> 2136.10]  this right here is how wise you are here's your wise score sir right because it's just gonna it's just
[2136.10 --> 2140.62]  gonna be completely broken it's gonna be absolutely a crap test and so for me i don't like the idea of
[2140.62 --> 2146.60]  like gated things based on some sort of nebulous scoring especially when it comes to things like iq or
[2146.60 --> 2151.44]  leak code because the reason why i specifically don't like those is any of those tests you take
[2151.44 --> 2155.92]  them more than once you'll do better like that's a fundamentally broken test that if you're like hey
[2155.92 --> 2160.30]  how intelligence is this person let's make him take a test okay they did something let's make him take
[2160.30 --> 2164.56]  another test they are now proportionally better than they were the last time they've done it there's
[2164.56 --> 2168.86]  something a bit broken that's a very well-studied phenomenon if you'd have if you just get you can move
[2168.86 --> 2173.60]  it you're not gonna move it that much but you're still gonna move it but 10 points is a generation of
[2173.60 --> 2178.02]  of intelligence like it doesn't you're not gonna you're not gonna move iq 10 points i mean i'll
[2178.02 --> 2182.38]  send you the i sent you some references on this on this topic because i mean what's interesting about
[2182.38 --> 2190.84]  iq testing is it's one of the few areas of psychology that replicates um where basically like
[2190.84 --> 2197.02]  everything else done in the last goddamn 80 years seems to fail replication time and again um iq testing
[2197.02 --> 2203.94]  and it's um correlation with positive outcomes and other aspects of life and professional
[2203.94 --> 2209.20]  performance is is very well established not to a total degree and i completely agree with you in
[2209.20 --> 2214.22]  the sense that like i met some very smart people who are also incredibly stupid right like they have
[2214.22 --> 2220.26]  the the firepower but it's not been programmed well right like there's like hey you gotta you got an
[2220.26 --> 2225.22]  m4 chip here and you're running some shitty ass software on it like this chip could do amazing
[2225.22 --> 2231.42]  things and you're not doing that um now either way i think the fundamental problem is no one has
[2231.42 --> 2237.22]  cracked hiring and i say that as someone who's currently in the final stages of trying to hire
[2237.22 --> 2245.38]  three programmers um two we're trying to hire who are juniors and one who's a senior and fuck it's
[2245.38 --> 2251.02]  really difficult it's really goddamn difficult and it's actually only gotten more difficult now that
[2251.02 --> 2258.14]  the best test that we've used for years and years which is sort of an at-home programming test um not
[2258.14 --> 2264.22]  even test yeah well maybe it is you build a product or something at home and just we give you a constrained
[2264.22 --> 2269.94]  uh part of one of our applications like something that resembles the work you would be doing day to
[2269.94 --> 2276.94]  day and we ask you to extend it in some specific ways and i've always found it so fascinating how this
[2276.94 --> 2282.36]  test has been able to reveal to me almost right away whether i would want to work with this person
[2282.36 --> 2287.78]  or not in ways that all the other signals as you say like oh this person went to yale like i'd be
[2287.78 --> 2292.88]  actually inclined to go if you could make it through a four-year program at a ivy league institution
[2292.88 --> 2298.90]  at least historically you would have to be pretty smart so that's a good signal it's just it's not
[2298.90 --> 2304.24]  it's not the determinant signal to me the determinant signal and now i can look back upon 25 years of
[2304.24 --> 2309.82]  hiring other people hiring other programmers seeing someone work with the real kind of code they'll be
[2309.82 --> 2316.08]  working on on a day-to-day basis with me is i've found no better measure the problem with that is a
[2316.08 --> 2324.18]  it's hard to do at scale so the the test that we ask applicants to to do they take like four to six
[2324.18 --> 2329.72]  hours i not only do they take four to six hours which is a lot to ask for someone who's applying for
[2329.72 --> 2335.68]  a job you better well be quite a ways down the pipeline before that request comes up right like
[2335.68 --> 2340.44]  you don't want to give that test to a thousand people it also takes quite a while to assess it
[2340.44 --> 2349.24]  right so i can't process a thousand uh applications that had that kind of uh test in it um so it's a late
[2349.24 --> 2359.54]  stage but really nice test and now i kind of fear ai fucked it yeah right oh absolutely but i mean
[2359.54 --> 2363.14]  i say that and then we actually this last test we were just about to get we gave it to all the
[2363.14 --> 2368.48]  models right like every i think we did like six models like all right solve the thing and some of
[2368.48 --> 2373.22]  the models you're like do you know what that's not actually bad and what was interesting about it was
[2373.22 --> 2378.86]  the solutions that model come up with would be quite reminiscent of a lot of junior code and you're
[2378.86 --> 2384.82]  like shit we're trying to hire junior programmers and if i can't tell anymore whether it's ai doing it
[2384.82 --> 2388.52]  or not because i'm giving a lot of allowances right right if you're hiring a junior programmer you're not
[2388.52 --> 2394.28]  going to ask the same things none of the models were even remotely close to the bar i would set
[2394.28 --> 2399.72]  for a senior programmer in terms of like the the code and so on that i i heard there's not just a new
[2399.72 --> 2405.90]  whatever claude four or sonnet four just drop that people are freaking out about in my feet so maybe
[2405.90 --> 2413.04]  maybe now we're all the way up there but at the junior end of scale i it's really hard how are you
[2413.04 --> 2417.38]  going to figure out who you're going to give a chance yeah well i would also i do want to rewind a
[2417.38 --> 2422.74]  little bit can we really rewind yeah i wanted to rewind with you prime actually um okay where so
[2422.74 --> 2429.08]  where are you rewinding to just i would like to be a touch more focused on college more itself in the
[2429.08 --> 2433.58]  sense that we haven't quite answered if college is worth it we we've all i think we all universally
[2433.58 --> 2438.54]  agree you probably shouldn't go four hundred thousand dollars into debt over especially over
[2438.54 --> 2443.32]  an education that is like largely based in trades if you will with programming like i think there is a
[2443.32 --> 2448.14]  good argument to be made in that but there's also the argument that there are countries where you
[2448.14 --> 2452.66]  you must get a degree if you expect anything like if you go to india if you if you were born and raised
[2452.66 --> 2456.90]  in india you can't just be like ah i'm just not going to get a degree and succeed like they don't
[2456.90 --> 2461.04]  have a you know a culture around that you're going to largely fail simply because you didn't go to
[2461.04 --> 2464.92]  school so there are also immigration like a lot of countries immigration requirements including the
[2464.92 --> 2469.60]  united states you you get preferential treatment if you have a degree in something that you're
[2469.60 --> 2474.60]  getting hired for you will get preferential treatment in many countries because the government
[2474.60 --> 2480.94]  uses that as a standard for competence and what i would say is the reason i think we're talking about
[2480.94 --> 2485.88]  the screening process part though prime is because that's the problem the problem is that companies
[2485.88 --> 2492.30]  don't have the ability to put in a good screening process i understand your uh your um
[2492.30 --> 2496.40]  uneasiness with something like an iq test and i kind of share that with you because
[2496.40 --> 2502.26]  one of the problems i find so what i'm no eugenicist as i can't eugenics all that is
[2502.26 --> 2507.28]  iq is based no i just can't sure yeah i mean whatever there's a there's a bad history but also i think
[2507.28 --> 2512.52]  the process has a couple issues too which is that because they're trying to do a standardized test with
[2512.52 --> 2519.46]  something like an iq test they're focusing on your ability to concentrate on very small problems so
[2519.46 --> 2524.66]  problems that have very low scope and especially in the world of programming one of the things that i find
[2524.66 --> 2529.78]  that people who i would consider very smart but are terrible programmers usually the reason for that
[2529.78 --> 2535.32]  is their ability to conceptualize large scope does not exist like they're a bit like they're the degree
[2535.32 --> 2540.44]  to which they can spend a lot of time thinking about larger things or to hold the larger things in their
[2540.44 --> 2546.50]  head is compromised for whatever reason but they do have tremendous firepower on a tiny thing so you
[2546.50 --> 2549.52]  know that's not to say they're necessarily going to be a horrible programmer at all things you could
[2549.52 --> 2554.52]  you could really clearly just go optimize this loop or something and maybe they could really do that
[2554.52 --> 2559.74]  because it's so tiny but when you're talking about i want someone you know like um david was saying
[2559.74 --> 2563.44]  senior programmer someone who's going to conceptualize the system and know like not to do stupid stuff
[2563.44 --> 2568.02]  they can't do that right even if there may be high iq because they can't hold the whole thing in their
[2568.02 --> 2573.78]  head right whereas um some of the other things like is what could this person be a great novelist or
[2573.78 --> 2578.86]  something that actually probably bears more on could you be a great systems architect because
[2578.86 --> 2582.52]  you're holding all these things in your head and knowing how some fuzzy things will
[2582.52 --> 2587.14]  interrelate with each other and will they play out well and so while i share your concern about
[2587.14 --> 2593.04]  that i would say it's still no matter what you think the screening thing is it's still a screening
[2593.04 --> 2597.64]  problem at the end of the day and outsourcing that screening by saying what we're going to do
[2597.64 --> 2602.82]  is have this four-year thing that kids go to that they pay all this money for and then they get a degree
[2602.82 --> 2609.48]  and by the way the entrance to that is basically an iq test it's just it's ridiculous right it's not it's a
[2609.48 --> 2616.14]  nonsensical solution to this problem that probably made sense in the past when it was hard to bring
[2616.14 --> 2621.86]  people together right you having professors in one place to work on stuff together made a lot of sense
[2621.86 --> 2627.66]  before the internet right nowadays it's like do we need these antiquated ideas of buildings where the
[2627.66 --> 2632.20]  people gather like can we do something better and can we do something better than charging people
[2632.20 --> 2636.90]  two hundred thousand dollars or whatever to go to certain ones with limited accessibility so only
[2636.90 --> 2641.38]  three thousand people can go through it blah blah blah blah blah it's like it just seems antiquated
[2641.38 --> 2647.32]  like a horse and buggy and my question is just can we make that pipeline that's part screening part
[2647.32 --> 2652.72]  education can we make it better and i think the answer has to be yes and unfortunately we're not
[2652.72 --> 2657.96]  trying that's what i would say iq test aside i i think you're also focusing on we're focusing on
[2657.96 --> 2663.80]  unique colleges um there are a good university right now uh you may not i know it's gonna sound like i'm
[2663.80 --> 2668.70]  just kind of toot my own horn here but the uh school of mines in south dakota a they've been uh
[2668.70 --> 2674.24]  in the acm world competition with there's only been like what 17 of them 20 of them has been hosted here
[2674.24 --> 2679.38]  because of that because of how good this school is at like just problem solving right but on top of it
[2679.38 --> 2685.14]  every single graduating class universally gets just hired out by google every single time all 50 just go
[2685.14 --> 2689.64]  straight to google straight into this pipeline and so i do think there are some schools that are just
[2689.64 --> 2694.96]  objectively better and they have created a culture and everybody that goes to the school it's not just
[2694.96 --> 2698.00]  about learning because that's i think that's one thing that we're kind of breaking down this is why
[2698.00 --> 2704.42]  iq tests again fail completely is that a job is not simply your ability to apply knowledge it is also
[2704.42 --> 2709.36]  your ability to like interact with others and you will never get that in the day and age of on the
[2709.36 --> 2715.06]  internet that's why i think like discord as great as it is is also really kind of bad thing for a lot of
[2715.06 --> 2719.72]  people because they abstain from having real relationships real interactions being able to
[2719.72 --> 2724.28]  look somebody in the eye and talk to somebody for a while and instead they have this kind of nice
[2724.28 --> 2729.18]  filtered screen and they don't ever have to do that i actually during college one of my interviews was
[2729.18 --> 2735.68]  for uh the naval underwater warfare group up in seattle and the reason why i got selected out of all
[2735.68 --> 2740.16]  the kids to go and do the like the on-site interview is the lady was like you're the only person that looked
[2740.16 --> 2745.10]  in my eyes while you talked to me not a single other student made eye contact the entire time
[2745.10 --> 2750.90]  and it's just like i won by simply being sociable like that's how i got in so it had nothing to do
[2750.90 --> 2754.94]  with whether i was smart or not i would like to think i was smart but nonetheless it's just because
[2754.94 --> 2760.48]  i was able to just talk to another human being which is a skill i fundamentally received by being
[2760.48 --> 2765.64]  around people my age doing the same thing solving the same problems i think that's where like the real
[2765.64 --> 2769.62]  again that's where i think a lot of the value is is that i think it's just in the group
[2769.62 --> 2773.92]  with some sort of smart person hopefully at the head leading people tj you haven't said a single
[2773.92 --> 2778.20]  thing so tj you got to get in thanks i've been trying but you know you keep it you keep hopping
[2778.20 --> 2781.80]  in prime it's just been years i got another thing to say and i'd like to say right now no okay go i'm
[2781.80 --> 2786.84]  gonna mute you right now uh i have that power so prime you can talk again in a little while uh no i'm
[2786.84 --> 2794.78]  just kidding uh do that i have to touch riverside and ruin everything anyway so um the thing that it feels
[2794.78 --> 2800.08]  like so often there's there's two things that i feel like for some reason a lot of hiring doesn't
[2800.82 --> 2804.78]  at least try and factor in i don't know how you do it i've i've had experience with doing the take
[2804.78 --> 2808.96]  home project before that's my favorite interview that i've ever had it was at the first startup that
[2808.96 --> 2814.56]  i worked on submitted it at the end of the week blah blah blah it was great they paid me for my time
[2814.56 --> 2820.38]  which was cool because it was a big ask whatever um but one is like what you're saying prime
[2820.38 --> 2826.42]  programming like in a company is way more than like typing into the computer you have to like
[2826.42 --> 2830.74]  figure out what your customers want what your clients want what other people on your team want
[2830.74 --> 2836.08]  what historical decisions were made for the company because of differing business expectations
[2836.08 --> 2841.68]  six months ago or a year ago or 10 years ago or 40 years ago depending on where you work and like
[2841.68 --> 2847.96]  what are the things that are coming up so there's a whole bunch of like social and like relational
[2847.96 --> 2853.66]  things and like a lot of businesses relationships anyways outside of just like can you even get your
[2853.66 --> 2859.28]  product working it's like why does someone stay with your product or whatever so and like you know
[2859.28 --> 2864.52]  a bunch of these have no factor it seems like they're just like the only way they test that is the first
[2864.52 --> 2868.96]  phone screen where they're like oh are you a human and like you talk to some hr person and they're like
[2868.96 --> 2875.68]  cool uh you can accurately reflect your birth date and your name congratulations you've made it past the
[2875.68 --> 2880.30]  first round and you're like that was it that's that's the only thing we're going to find out if
[2880.30 --> 2886.40]  i want to work with this guy later um and then the second thing which is kind of like it's related to
[2886.40 --> 2892.50]  the idea of like 10x programming is that like the worst software developers are like way negative x
[2892.50 --> 2896.98]  programming in the sense that they not only do they not do the thing you're looking for they actively
[2896.98 --> 2904.08]  set your entire company back either by like literally taking down prod all the time like the most obvious
[2904.08 --> 2910.30]  one but they can just make code that makes it worse to write more code in the future so it's not only
[2910.30 --> 2916.12]  that oh well we just had to wait six months and billy finally finished the feature it would have been
[2916.12 --> 2921.16]  cool if that was six days but it took six months it's like no billy took six weeks to make this and
[2921.16 --> 2928.12]  now no one else can ship to prod no like no one else can figure out what billy did and now it's broken
[2928.12 --> 2935.98]  forever so that like and the long tail of that is like there's a lot of area under that curve of
[2935.98 --> 2943.50]  people i have like worked with or seen where they actively just make the entire product uh worse and
[2943.50 --> 2950.42]  then the last thing too is that there's some scales where you can't even compare like for me i can't run
[2950.42 --> 2955.88]  a marathon like i like physically i wouldn't be able to like finish one i would get eliminated i would
[2955.88 --> 2959.72]  get disqualified right like i wouldn't be able to finish literally can't get disqualified but
[2959.72 --> 2963.46]  somehow you would figure it out tj well they like close it down at some point they're like people
[2963.46 --> 2968.98]  have to drive on the road again you know it's dnf did not finish yeah this exists in a marathon yeah
[2968.98 --> 2975.40]  and that's the same thing is true for a bunch of software projects i've worked with people who like
[2975.40 --> 2981.90]  no matter how much time you gave them no matter how whatever they're just not ever going to fix
[2981.90 --> 2987.70]  this particular problem due to technical complexity or handling all the scope or like
[2987.70 --> 2994.40]  figuring out the way that the customer actually wants to use the thing so that's like infinity x
[2994.40 --> 3002.16]  programmer like the there's there's no comparison it's it never happens or someday it happens there's
[3002.16 --> 3008.44]  infinity difference between the two and like all of those things it feels like just it doesn't seem
[3008.44 --> 3011.72]  like people care about maybe it's because hr departments at the big companies are in charge
[3011.72 --> 3015.38]  of a lot of the hiring process i don't know that's where i feel like i'm taking crazy pills over here
[3015.38 --> 3019.76]  can i say one thing really quick before we get in too much like the before the youtube comments just
[3019.76 --> 3025.60]  fill up yeah it'd be an undefined difference between programmers not infinity because i just know
[3025.60 --> 3031.28]  i know that's going to be the top comment if i don't say that so okay keep going okay i'll go get
[3031.28 --> 3037.38]  my math degree out and then i'll have to burn it because i have a divide by zero yeah right i have a
[3037.38 --> 3042.60]  mathematics major and i failed them sorry sorry uh because it's a divide by zero right so you have
[3042.60 --> 3047.46]  you know you've got this person finished it in in six days and this person will never finish it so
[3047.46 --> 3052.62]  it's six over zero is the dip is the ratio between those two and it's not infinity infinity
[3052.62 --> 3056.58]  times zero will never be six i mean i'm sure there is a mathematician somewhere who's like actually
[3056.58 --> 3061.54]  in this particular type of group it is and i'm like so that will be the second top comment
[3061.54 --> 3065.86]  so i had to say that as well but i just that mathematician so it's approaching infinity
[3065.86 --> 3071.42]  oh go ahead brian no it's just undefined it cannot infinity this is not you want a mathematician not
[3071.42 --> 3076.94]  me to tell you this so but it's undefined because there's no there is no ability to reach it period
[3076.94 --> 3082.80]  not not at infinity it will never happen this discussion is the zero x programmer one who never
[3082.80 --> 3093.42]  finishes all right anyway go ahead well yeah so anyway so those are just some of the things where i feel
[3093.42 --> 3099.66]  like college college can help you in some of those verticals right where like you can get some skills
[3099.66 --> 3106.00]  for learning how to work with people if you're like actually trying at college like i went to a small
[3106.00 --> 3113.00]  liberal arts college i lived at home to save money and like you know didn't have to pay room and board
[3113.00 --> 3118.50]  thanks mom and dad shout out mom and dad they didn't make me pay rent while i was living at home uh you
[3118.50 --> 3123.80]  know and like but i did activities at school i met people i made relationships talked to my professors
[3123.80 --> 3128.84]  you know like they helped me get internships whatever i learned how to work with people and
[3128.84 --> 3134.22]  make connections awesome those things would have been a lot harder for me like otherwise because my dad's
[3134.22 --> 3141.24]  an accountant and he doesn't know anybody my family is far from tech adjacent you know like you know
[3141.24 --> 3146.96]  my mom's a music teacher and my dad's an accountant right like there was no connections to get into
[3146.96 --> 3152.06]  like software world so like that can be that first vertical can help you out a lot in college if
[3152.06 --> 3156.62]  you're paying attention and trying but you could also spend your whole day on discord like you're
[3156.62 --> 3162.20]  saying prime playing video games and never talking to a real human at school which seems crazy it seems
[3162.20 --> 3166.18]  like that would be impossible but it's definitely possible twitch chat can back us up half of them are
[3166.18 --> 3171.98]  that guy go out and talk to somebody um right and and then it can also help you with some of the other
[3171.98 --> 3176.82]  problems because you can like talk to your professors and figure out how these like you could just
[3176.82 --> 3181.08]  you got to do some of those things though it's not going to be the school handing those to you i think
[3181.08 --> 3191.04]  yeah for me the bottom line here is uh if you i mean we're talking to programmers here if you aspire to
[3191.04 --> 3198.76]  be a programmer i think going to college is totally worth it at the right price and it's all about the
[3198.76 --> 3205.40]  price like a product isn't bad or good mode i mean some products are just truly bad at any price
[3205.40 --> 3211.80]  but a lot of things that exist in this world are bad or good depending on how much they cost right
[3211.80 --> 3217.40]  like you have completely different expectations about what you get out of something if you didn't
[3217.40 --> 3224.92]  spend the next 20 years worth of salary on it if it was something more affordable more approachable
[3224.92 --> 3230.86]  i'd say it'd be far more of a no-brainer i there's a lot of kids in the u.s where i just feel like
[3230.86 --> 3238.10]  no it wasn't worth it for you even if you got like a decent education it the price was just too high
[3238.10 --> 3242.90]  yeah it's like warren buffett uh always said like there's not a good or bad stock there's just a good
[3242.90 --> 3248.32]  or bad price for it again caveats of company going out of business is literally worth zero but
[3248.32 --> 3254.92]  with almost everything it's all about what is the price yeah and i think too like the opportunity cost
[3254.92 --> 3260.68]  like i was just talking with a guy who was in the middle of school and then i don't know if i can
[3260.68 --> 3265.98]  say the company some nice company that is doing well offered to hire him and so he just left school
[3265.98 --> 3272.60]  and then he's working there and it's like the opportunity cost was go stay at school and maybe
[3272.60 --> 3276.78]  get the same job later or just like go there and work for two years and then if he needs to he can go
[3276.78 --> 3282.14]  finish the other two years of school awesome good for him i was like dude that's so awesome i'm so hyped
[3282.14 --> 3287.36]  for you he's moving to san francisco he's gonna go do his thing like that's really good i tried to
[3287.36 --> 3291.46]  convince my younger sister she's 10 years younger than i am she just graduated school but when she
[3291.46 --> 3297.84]  was starting i was like yo i will you can come work with me for four years and you only have to pay me
[3297.84 --> 3305.76]  half of what your tuition was and she didn't take me up on the offer but i was like a little bit
[3305.76 --> 3310.56]  serious actually that if she really wanted to like try and work with me like we could do basically
[3310.56 --> 3314.32]  like a tradesman thing i wouldn't have actually charged her money i wish there was more of that
[3314.32 --> 3319.68]  i was just talking to someone about that that programming in general seems exceedingly well
[3319.68 --> 3326.20]  suited for the apprenticeship model exactly for all the reasons you guys were mentioning that this is
[3326.20 --> 3332.60]  more of a trade in many ways if you take the total sum of all programmers out there the vast majority
[3332.60 --> 3338.96]  of them are trades people and they would learn more quicker better if they were apprenticing under
[3338.96 --> 3344.28]  someone yeah and i was like your resume will look cooler like you have real job experience for four
[3344.28 --> 3351.66]  years as opposed to like one little degree spot that gets discarded like at a lot of places um but
[3351.66 --> 3355.74]  there were other you know there were other factors or whatever but i was like i would you know that
[3355.74 --> 3360.64]  would have been cool like to be able to do that and i think if there were more options like this
[3360.64 --> 3365.98]  or ways for this to happen it would be really exciting to see because i think like the tradesmen
[3365.98 --> 3371.06]  like i have a bunch of friends one of my buddy one one semester of college was like this sucks
[3371.06 --> 3379.18]  quit started plumbing immediately he was a professional plumber long before i graduated school
[3379.18 --> 3384.96]  was doing great owned a house married you know the whole thing and it's like that was awesome for him
[3384.96 --> 3389.58]  but they do the apprenticeship model he went and he followed a plumber around and did plumbing things
[3389.58 --> 3394.42]  you know and it's like that would have been way better if those opportunities i think existed in
[3394.42 --> 3401.88]  programming more often do you think so do you think spending four years at an accredited place
[3401.88 --> 3408.32]  in the site of ai now that it's coming down and all that do you think that it is still just
[3408.32 --> 3415.52]  practically worth it at the right price yes i want to say that what david said is exactly the way to
[3415.52 --> 3421.26]  think of it it's like it you have to know how much you're spending and and if you don't know how
[3421.26 --> 3425.30]  much you're spending on it then i don't think you could make that decision because it certainly does
[3425.30 --> 3430.62]  change the equation it means that now like you know if you don't think you're gonna be very good
[3430.62 --> 3436.94]  at this thing eventually then a high price school is simply not it should never really be considered
[3436.94 --> 3442.84]  at that point right because ai will be ai will be taking some of the hiring away presumably right
[3442.84 --> 3448.52]  uh if for no other reason than like the the junior programmer thing where it's like if you have
[3448.52 --> 3452.78]  someone who's never really gonna get all that good well ai at least what i've seen of the
[3452.78 --> 3457.78]  programming from ai it looks like somebody i would never hire but that i know does work at a number of
[3457.78 --> 3463.02]  these companies right that's what ai looks like it looks like like i would never let this thing
[3463.02 --> 3467.90]  anywhere near any code i was working on but i know a ton of code bases where this is just a like
[3467.90 --> 3473.76]  accepted commit right the microsoft start menu right oh yeah like for example this thing you know the
[3473.76 --> 3478.80]  the ai could just produce the same quality as that right like you know brought to you that by the
[3478.80 --> 3484.20]  people who said that it would take a very long time for them to figure out how to make it uh so that
[3484.20 --> 3488.90]  you could put it back on the top again like it used to that was like a huge thing they were like well
[3488.90 --> 3493.84]  there's a lot of work that would have to go into that i'm like yes that's the ai would be operating at
[3493.84 --> 3500.06]  about the same level as that start menu right um but i guess i would say that does affect the market
[3500.06 --> 3507.26]  though because plenty of programmers were currently in that tranche of you know not very good and so
[3507.26 --> 3512.52]  that does remove that does change the the market dynamics even if ai never really gets any better
[3512.52 --> 3517.42]  than today it still changes those market dynamics at least a little bit which means that price that
[3517.42 --> 3522.60]  you should be looking for is going to change that price for education can't be as high it has to be a
[3522.60 --> 3527.14]  little bit less if if economics is you know if economics works the way we think it does right
[3527.14 --> 3531.72]  and the other opportunities can't be like as good that's the other thing that i feel like
[3531.72 --> 3539.02]  because if more people are like hiring or like trying to do apprenticeship or like you can even just
[3539.02 --> 3543.82]  try like i'm not a huge boot camp guy or anything but like you could try a boot camp for way less money
[3543.82 --> 3549.86]  and see if you can get hired for it like and you grind on that for a year instead of going to school
[3549.86 --> 3558.60]  like just even making money for three years instead of paying money at like any ratio is like that adds
[3558.60 --> 3564.92]  up really fast like even if you're making 40 000 and not spending 10 yeah that's 200k difference in
[3564.92 --> 3570.10]  your life like that's a lot of money you know so the other opportunities i'm interested to see what's
[3570.10 --> 3576.62]  going to happen with with like ai and with what is software development going to look like what what or
[3576.62 --> 3582.30]  like what our crud software development jobs going to look like you know because there's a huge portion
[3582.30 --> 3585.90]  of the market where it's like i don't know i don't know what that's going to look like market yeah
[3585.90 --> 3590.94]  they're just like market firms that just build simple sites for people that's a big thing and people
[3590.94 --> 3597.62]  need them so yeah all right um there's a common thing that everybody says and i'd love to get
[3597.62 --> 3603.66]  everyone's prime gotta go soon okay uh dj do you want your 15 seconds super hot take on this one
[3603.66 --> 3609.90]  shoot every single programmer says that they want to be a farmer are they delusional or is it true
[3609.90 --> 3618.44]  uh they're absolutely delusional i don't think most programs that have actually ever spend a day on a
[3618.44 --> 3624.20]  farm looking at what it is but i also do i do think there's something true in it in the sense that
[3624.20 --> 3630.70]  working with a computer all day can be alienating in a sense that i don't actually get from
[3630.70 --> 3637.16]  as many people as i know who have worked farming that it isn't deeply alienating in the same way so
[3637.16 --> 3642.12]  i totally get the aspiration but i i think it is delusional and the vast majority of people
[3642.12 --> 3648.20]  actually would do better not to test that delusion because it's the delusion that gives them hope
[3648.20 --> 3652.50]  do you know what life sucks right now this week sucks right now but you know what i can imagine
[3652.50 --> 3659.04]  i could be a farmer and i'd be happy and if you test out that delusion and you find out it's not true
[3659.04 --> 3665.52]  at all and you can't hack it for four hours milking cows what are you left with no hope at all right
[3665.52 --> 3671.24]  like total nihilism so like keep your little illusions around like keep them little jars of delusion
[3671.24 --> 3677.64]  of illusions because if you take them down and examining them too uh close you might find like
[3677.64 --> 3683.58]  yeah do you know what a little alienation can uh get replaced real quick by existential dread
[3683.58 --> 3690.56]  love it that was absolutely a great ending all right thanks so much for having me on that was
[3690.56 --> 3696.44]  really uh thanks for coming yes my pleasure today's show was sponsored by code rabbit and so i just
[3696.44 --> 3700.56]  wanted to take a quick little moment to shout them out developers are you tired of getting code reviews
[3700.56 --> 3706.58]  that just say lgtm or nit please take these seven things hey your variable name is res it should be
[3706.58 --> 3713.06]  result and reject no uh meet code rabbit ai reviews right inside your editor starting with vs code
[3713.06 --> 3719.32]  cursor and windsurf sorry no vim yet i know my heart is broken hit review and bam feedback appears before
[3719.32 --> 3725.98]  you even open a poll request code rabbit can help you flag the bugs your vibe code lm bot missed and with
[3725.98 --> 3731.92]  one easy click hand the context back for fixes line by line to some of your frantic or your favorite
[3731.92 --> 3737.06]  agentic tools they offer generous free tier 50 reviews a day no cost grab the extension at uh
[3737.06 --> 3745.40]  coderabbit.link slash primogen dash vs code and ship cleaner code today link in the description link in
[3745.40 --> 3752.08]  the description in the future thanks dj oh yes it worked i just dude i set up a second scene for
[3752.08 --> 3756.54]  three people just to see if this would work and oh my gosh it worked let's go let's go i did not expect
[3756.54 --> 3764.44]  this to work anyways uh hey that was awesome by the way no i are we ready i had never met him before
[3764.44 --> 3769.26]  and he what a fantastic guest oh my god he was he is one of my favorite people in the universe are we
[3769.26 --> 3773.96]  still live yeah we're still live okay all right just making sure yeah i thought we were still live
[3773.96 --> 3780.78]  yeah i meant to say that live if uh if possible because i i really enjoyed it i really enjoyed what
[3780.78 --> 3786.64]  he had to say yeah no i absolutely uh i absolutely am just in just a huge fan of what he has to say
[3786.64 --> 3791.42]  and i think he he's right on a huge portion of things now i'm still not on your guys team with
[3791.42 --> 3796.58]  the whole iq test thing but i do i do appreciate about iq so don't lump me into anybody well like i said
[3796.58 --> 3802.34]  that was more his thing than mine because like i like i said i i don't feel like it captures i don't
[3802.34 --> 3808.48]  feel like iq tests capture what i'm really looking for in a programmer because they would only really
[3808.48 --> 3814.54]  tell me like how hyper fixated they can be on small things so like i don't know and you know
[3814.54 --> 3819.40]  i'm not up on the psychology research here maybe it's true that iq generalizes out to that
[3819.40 --> 3825.44]  more or less like or as well as any other test we have and that could be true but at least for me
[3825.44 --> 3831.72]  i prefer screening to be something more action oriented like okay here's this like larger pool of
[3831.72 --> 3838.10]  things go sort through it figure out how to do something with it right and uh that kind of stuff
[3838.10 --> 3841.90]  if you were going to do something for screening i would think it would be more like that and not
[3841.90 --> 3848.34]  like an iq test but i so i'm not really i'm not on the same page uh as dhh was i guess if if he's
[3848.34 --> 3853.12]  actually suggesting that an iq test would be useful but i am on the same page in the term in the terms
[3853.12 --> 3858.62]  of like it it'd be better even an iq test would be better than the system we have now so i think now
[3858.62 --> 3866.44]  it's just saying bad college is like a very roundabout method of like right iq plus some other stuff i would
[3866.44 --> 3873.66]  also say i've definitely seen and or seen some code by 155 iq haskell geniuses yeah that nobody
[3873.66 --> 3878.12]  in the world should have ever written and should be wiped from the face of the earth yeah so if
[3878.12 --> 3884.40]  it's just iq then they would get hired and they would bring the company to an end goodbye that's
[3884.40 --> 3887.20]  the end of the episode right now bye everybody
[3887.20 --> 3889.36]  boot up the day
[3889.36 --> 3894.12]  vibe caught in errors on my screen
[3894.12 --> 3896.98]  terminal coffee
[3896.98 --> 3901.88]  live in the dream
[3901.88 --> 3904.62]  you
