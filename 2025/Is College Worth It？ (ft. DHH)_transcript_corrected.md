[0.00 → 3.84] Welcome to the startup today we have on with us, we have taught say hi teach
[3.84 → 12.56] Hi teach all right uh we got Casey curator hello everyone, and we got DHH the race car driver himself
[12.56 → 21.94] all righty so by the way today we got a good topic it should you go to college
[21.94 → 26.86] I thought the topic was college worth it that's a different that's a different question
[26.86 → 33.68] the topic is college worth it nailed the intro he's got it first try right here all right
[33.68 → 43.06] uh anyway sorry it is college worth it hey David you are on the show for the first time so why don't
[43.06 → 51.40] you kick us off is college worth it and as the only non-American well is it worth what is it worth
[51.40 → 56.84] 10 grand yeah I think it's worth 10 grand is it worth a quarter of a million dollars in debt
[56.84 → 62.88] absolutely not unless you're guaranteed to be raking it in when you get out on the other side
[62.88 → 70.60] I think the weirdness of all of this is coming from Denmark where the state will pay for your
[70.60 → 77.20] college education the state will spend like last I looked it up I think it was something like 10 grand
[77.20 → 86.42] to educate you so to hear that people go to college where you can spend 90 000 a year for a
[86.42 → 92.04] four-year degree and I think that's even without room and board just sounds insane I don't understand
[92.04 → 99.40] why Americans married the idea of getting education with getting a four-year cruise like why did that
[99.40 → 106.32] have to be the same thing oh you also get a five-star hotel thrown in and by the way you have to pay for it
[106.32 → 111.66] for the rest of your life that just seems insane to me not the idea that you have to or should get
[111.66 → 116.68] an education if you're so inclined to get high education but that you're going to pay a ridiculous
[116.68 → 123.52] ungodly sum for it that you're going to carry on your back for the next 10 15 20 years is there any
[123.52 → 128.86] education that's worth it that is worth the 250 000 like is there some role that it's like okay it's fine
[128.86 → 133.08] because is it purely just because you're going to make money is that your argument like so like a doctor
[133.08 → 136.30] doctors come out they spend obviously hundreds of thousands of dollars because they have to go to
[136.30 → 141.74] you know college for eight to ten years just like me but I'm not a doctor and uh like does that is
[141.74 → 146.56] that the same thing are you okay with that because you know they're going to make a lot I think that's
[146.56 → 153.30] at least a financial sort of situation that can make sense I know in Denmark there are educations where
[153.30 → 158.16] you spend a lot if you want to become a pilot that's really expensive, and you normally take on
[158.16 → 163.98] some sort of loan agreement, or you sometimes take something on with the military you're going to do this
[163.98 → 169.98] amount of years of service, and they're going to teach you how to become a pilot but in the U.S. this
[169.98 → 178.20] idea that you can spend four years learning Russian poetry and that's going to cost you 100 grand 200
[178.20 → 183.78] grand 50 grand 20 grand like on the other side like what the fuck are you going to do how are you going
[183.78 → 190.84] to make that money back I think it's just absolutely mind-blowing insane that there's a system set up
[190.84 → 195.36] where the loans are backed by the government which means that there's no skin in the game for
[195.36 → 203.14] neither the lenders nor the educational institutions to actually produce something that will create a
[203.14 → 209.56] return that someone is going to spend a proportionate amount on the education as to what they're going to
[209.56 → 215.16] get out of it from a job and i I mean I'm not even against Russian poetry I think there should be
[215.16 → 221.56] people who study that, but they should be perhaps encouraged to take on an obscene amount of debt
[221.56 → 229.12] for prospects that just aren't there to ever, ever pay it off in the end and I think that's really what
[229.12 → 235.76] just fires me up about all this stuff is that the economics is so warped, and it all seems to hinge on
[235.76 → 241.38] this idea that like well if we can just convince uh I don't know a president to forgive all the loans
[241.38 → 248.16] without changing a damn thing about how the system works somehow that's going to be good no, no the
[248.16 → 252.58] fundamentally flawed part is that there is's no skin in the game for the lenders there's no skin
[252.58 → 259.02] in the game for the universities and there are just a bunch of 18-year-olds being asked whether they
[259.02 → 266.12] would like free money to take a four-year fucking cruise to come out of the other side with a degree
[266.12 → 274.80] in Russian poetry that's going to pay 22 000 a year like what why why are you doing this to kids
[274.80 → 282.66] I think that borders into something that's morally reprehensible even if you can say like well you knew
[282.66 → 288.18] you signed on the dotted line you could have read it's not even fine print I mean you actually do
[288.18 → 292.92] have to be slightly retarded to think that you can take on two hundred thousand dollars or a hundred
[292.92 → 298.02] thousand dollars worth of debt and that that degree in Russian poetry is somehow going to work
[298.02 → 301.98] out, but you know what that's what 17-year-olds are that's what 18-year-olds are they're retarded
[301.98 → 307.42] in the sense that they're like their brains are not literally not fully formed I think the female
[307.42 → 314.74] brain formed a little earlier the male brain 25 that's by the time in my experience there's still
[314.74 → 321.86] sometimes a little time left to cook even after 25 so I think it's just I mean it's just a terrible
[321.86 → 332.20] construct to entice kids to take on these massive loan burdens with the entire pressure of a society
[332.20 → 337.70] telling them that if they don't go to college and preferably if they don't go to a prestige college
[337.70 → 342.48] they're fucked right like their life is over they're never going to make any money they're going
[342.48 → 347.90] to be a loser which by the way isn't true there are plenty of losers who finished their four-year
[347.90 → 353.92] degree and again saddled with a bunch of debt and can't get a job and like that's a fair definition
[353.92 → 358.70] of a loser in fact it's a worse definition of a loser than someone who doesn't go through all that
[358.70 → 366.02] and at least doesn't have the debt burden right but this idea that we've shuffled all kind of societal
[366.02 → 370.62] pressures towards you have to get a college degree because hey look at the statistics over time blah blah
[370.62 → 378.54] yeah also we need some welders we need some carpenters we need a bunch of other professions
[378.54 → 386.22] to keep society fucking running and some of them can be quite lucrative right so even just for an
[386.22 → 391.92] individual there is something really screwed up about how the encouragement system goes I think uh
[391.92 → 399.64] mike wrote and the whole 30 jobs things and so on I is absolutely spot on in my optics um but all right
[399.64 → 404.34] not everyone wants to be a welder and some folks should go to college we should also have a
[404.34 → 412.24] bunch of educated people we don't need to take that a desire and a need for education and marry it to a
[412.24 → 419.52] luxury cruise that's going to cost an obscene amount of money developers are you tired of code reviews that

[463.88 → 467.40] which is these 18-year-olds can make a decision that's going to cost them hundreds of thousands
[467.40 → 470.84] of dollars, but they can't even buy alcohol because we think they're not responsible enough to be able to
[470.84 → 475.62] drink alcohol which is kind of like a hilarious kind of world we live in where it's just like oh yeah
[475.62 → 480.30] they totally get a life decision that's going to saddle them with debt for the next 20 potential
[480.30 → 486.30] years of their life but hey you can't rent a car, yet honestly you're not you're not capable to run
[486.30 → 491.64] to rent a car but hey you can definitely make this decision like one is way worse than the other one
[491.64 → 496.46] and it's just far more impactful that's actually that's why the car company doesn't want to
[496.46 → 500.96] let them rent a car because they know they're going to make bad decisions and the car company is going
[500.96 → 509.38] the game the one yes if is that 18-year-old crashes the car and the company renting them
[509.38 → 514.30] can't recoup that money because the fucking 18-year-old doesn't have any they know you know what
[514.30 → 518.90] that wouldn't be smart I should not rent this person my car because they're going to crash it and I won't
[518.90 → 523.68] be able to get my money back therefore I'm not going to do it and I think that's by the way at the
[523.68 → 530.00] root of all this is good intentions the good intention that if we underwrite the loans the student loans
[530.00 → 535.66] more people have access to loans which means that more people will have access to education
[535.66 → 541.30] and zero consideration has been taken to like the second order effect what happens when there's just
[541.30 → 546.76] free unbacked money with no skin in the game yeah prices are going to go to the moon and who's going
[546.76 → 554.24] to vacuum all the excess capital administrators you've seen the graph right like since whatever 1960
[554.24 → 562.36] complete flat line with uh professors and educators and adjuncts, and then you see from 1980 forward the
[562.36 → 569.36] chart just goes parabolical when you look at administrators i what was the stat something
[569.36 → 575.54] like some college had a 10 to 1 ratio of admins to students or something just truly bizarre it might
[575.54 → 579.08] have been Columbia i think or something yeah I remember seeing something like that yeah
[579.08 → 583.60] and you just make any sense that can't be real there can't be a hundred thousand administrators
[583.60 → 588.98] he's not really exaggerating I don't remember the exact for it either but like there were
[588.98 → 594.66] were numbers that would be absurd right I remember it being I'm gonna fucking ask it yeah it's there
[594.66 → 600.70] was more ridiculous than you think our number yeah it had to be like administrators to professors
[600.70 → 605.94] for every single professor there are 10 administrators because students would just be would be the
[605.94 → 608.96] most ridiculous yeah it was something like 10 to 1, but it was like one-to-one with students
[608.96 → 613.42] it was like it was like the same number or something maybe it was insane okay which also it's like
[613.42 → 617.40] having a company, and you have more managers than employees like everybody's walking around like
[617.40 → 626.92] we're managing oh no here it is thanks, thanks uh ChatGPT uh at Yale 5,460 administrators
[626.92 → 635.64] managing fewer than 5,000 undergraduate students more than a one-to-one ratio what you don't think
[635.64 → 640.42] you're paying for that you don't think you're paying for that uh hall monitor like all the time
[640.42 → 645.30] just dedicated to you and only you'd be one thing too if they like literally followed you around
[645.30 → 651.34] they're like to we're gonna we have a person whose sole job is they're going to follow you for four years
[651.34 → 655.54] yeah we're going to optimize everything about your life we're going to get you in the best classes I'm
[655.54 → 659.76] going to be reaching out to people to get you internships I'm going to be like yeah your personal
[659.76 → 664.36] assistant your Gail personal assistant right and also like it gets drunk for you like whoever that
[664.36 → 668.42] person is they get drunk for you, they get in fights for you, they date for you all the stuff
[668.42 → 673.88] and then you just get the outcome whatever it is at the end of it imagine you could just be like hey
[673.88 → 680.62] can you ask out the personal assistant of so-and-so over there, and we can sort of figure out if we're a
[680.62 → 685.56] match and then like we'll go on a date I'm too busy studying and working hard, but it sounds like
[685.56 → 690.26] what are these people doing absolutely what are these people fucking doing well first they're
[690.26 → 697.18] making your life fucking miserable 100 the college experience that had a one-on-one ratio of admins to
[697.18 → 704.80] students is infinitely worse than the experience of 1967 that had 100 students to one administrator
[704.80 → 710.80] whatever the ratio used to be 100 that experience is worth worse and I think I mean for me the great
[710.80 → 717.48] illustration of this was during covid where student was just treated like cattle in a cage, and you're
[717.48 → 721.82] thinking like wait what people are paying for this they're paying for this fucking experience they
[721.82 → 728.90] don't even get to go to classes they don't even get to have the joy of that four-year uh cruise they get
[728.90 → 734.78] to be confined into a dorm and then there's an administrator that's going to run around and yell at them if
[734.78 → 742.32] they walk outside without a mask on well what are you doing this is insane and then like did they not
[742.32 → 748.88] just admit like yeah well I know you guys didn't really learn anything this semester so everyone
[748.88 → 753.28] just gets an a didn't even like pretend at the end of the semester like I had younger siblings
[753.28 → 759.48] in college like during covid, and they're like we just didn't do anything, and you're like what do you
[759.48 → 763.70] you still got the grade you didn't have to like repeat or anything oh yeah I got a check for that you're
[763.70 → 769.08] like what that's I didn't even know that was a thing that that is that's crazy that's like the okay
[769.08 → 773.18] so I can't tell what is the worst part about or the best part about college whether it's the actual
[773.18 → 778.46] education or the fact that you're going through college with people approximately your age learning
[778.46 → 782.90] the same topic and being able to kind of learn how to argue with each other and really become a full
[782.90 → 789.16] formed adult and all that if you're not even going to school or class during that time, and you didn't
[789.16 → 792.90] get to be around other people like the whole entire college experience doesn't make any sense this is
[792.90 → 797.84] also my whole problem with remote education they're really there's a big push into like remodify all
[797.84 → 803.52] aspects of life, and it's just like how why would you ever pay to go to a university when like the
[803.52 → 809.26] true value of a university is in the moments of being around people and learning in some sort of
[809.26 → 815.30] co kind of way like those were single-handedly my best experiences in college and really where i
[815.30 → 821.50] learned how to become actually a good programmer was at was the after labs after hours arguing about an
[821.50 → 826.22] ACM programming competition figuring out how to solve the coin change problem because none of us were ever
[826.22 → 830.94] able to do it and there was no just ChatGPT to spit out an answer it's like that's where the magic was
[830.94 → 838.48] well I would actually argue like one greater or one more severe than that I guess I would say which
[838.48 → 846.60] is that college what it really is as far as I've been able to determine is like an institution that is
[846.60 → 855.96] extracting money from you while getting the value from you so it's basically a strictly one-sided thing
[855.96 → 860.90] all the students who come together they're actually the value like you interacting with
[860.90 → 865.96] the other students and stuff like that and being there, and you know going through the process
[865.96 → 872.10] is valuable to you and valuable to the other students because of each other but the actual
[872.10 → 877.76] education you're receiving is usually not very good compared to that right and compared to the other
[877.76 → 883.32] you know resources that you now have available for learning things and the reason that I think that's
[883.32 → 887.74] somewhat like the reason I think there's a reasonable amount of evidence for that is just
[887.74 → 893.56] because people right now are doing stuff like using ChatGPT to cheat on their papers or whatever right
[893.56 → 899.00] and all this sort of stuff if you were going there for the education you would never cheat because
[899.00 → 904.18] that's like paying for something and then not taking the thing right that's like buying a car and
[904.18 → 908.52] saying oh keep the car I'm going to walk it's kind of like getting a gym membership and never going to the gym
[908.52 → 913.72] so we know like basically it's like no the thing what you were getting was whatever was
[913.72 → 917.68] happening to you and the other students that's the thing and the credential at the end is the part
[917.68 → 923.74] that you actually cared about and wanted to pay for but the education even can't be that good
[923.74 → 927.22] because people aren't even mad when they don't get it or like with covid people are probably like
[927.22 → 932.74] sweet I didn't have to read all the books for that class I just got the for free that would never
[932.74 → 936.64] happen if you felt like the thing you were getting was really valuable right you would never do that
[936.64 → 941.86] you'd be like oh my god I object like I want those classes back I need to study that particular piece
[941.86 → 947.96] of Russian poetry, and you didn't let me do that right yeah I want to inject one thing which is the
[947.96 → 953.16] reason why that's true is because these kids are retarded in the same way we just talked about they're
[953.16 → 959.54] retarded taking on 200 grand worth of student loan debt right they're not literally they their brains are
[959.54 → 965.74] not formed they are forming that is what the university college experience is supposed to do right
[965.74 → 970.80] but at that moment no they don't have that I didn't have that I mean I was always thrilled
[970.80 → 978.24] whenever class was cancelled I was like sweet um so they're not thinking long term because literally
[978.24 → 983.12] the brain is not done with the part that does long-term thinking so when you're asking them like
[983.12 → 988.54] hey do you know what maybe you should study because who's going to care about this diploma by the way
[988.54 → 994.60] not a lot do by the time you get into say uh programming if you're getting a diploma for
[994.60 → 1001.00] for programming, and you don't know how to program that diploma ain't worth shit right there's a status
[1001.00 → 1008.20] token in that diploma that may open some doors may give you an opportunity may give you an audition
[1008.20 → 1014.00] you still gotta fucking act you still gotta be able to do the thing I mean it's all good that you can
[1014.00 → 1020.16] apply, and you'll make the first cut uh of the recruiter sorting oh this person went to Yale like
[1020.16 → 1024.98] let's make sure that they are in the second round of this shit, and then you're going to be at the whiteboard
[1024.98 → 1029.94] and then fucking what are you going to do you don't know anything because you just coasted through
[1029.94 → 1036.56] everything you spend an enormous amount of money for a status token that's going to be revealed in a
[1036.56 → 1042.88] second to be worth nothing now I don't know how it works in I don't know investment banking
[1042.88 → 1047.90] maybe the status token there kind of opened some doors and everyone is full of shit in investment
[1047.90 → 1052.44] banking you don't have to know anything I mean that's the stereotype programmers would like to
[1052.44 → 1056.02] believe about finance people I think or maybe management or something you go into management
[1056.02 → 1061.16] consulting but also I mean government I don't actually think that's true I do think you'll you
[1061.16 → 1067.16] gotta have some smarts to it right so I think you're exactly right it's an awful deal
[1067.16 → 1072.84] to pay way too much even if it has something of value it's an even worse deal to pay all that money
[1072.84 → 1079.06] for something of zero value and I think again that's part of the that's why kids go to school
[1079.06 → 1085.30] because they don't fucking know anything or everything they have so I think they do I remember
[1085.30 → 1091.04] oh right I remember knowing everything DH okay and I mean that by the way that does have value right
[1091.04 → 1095.56] like ignorance I'm actually a big fan of when it comes to a lot of things it has to be backed by
[1095.56 → 1101.48] some degree of competence or at least a trajectory towards competence but if you have those things
[1101.48 → 1107.42] ignorance is great right like it allows you to not know how hard it's going to be, and you're going
[1107.42 → 1111.94] to start, and you're going to be delusional about how big it's going to be, and you know what maybe it
[1111.94 → 1117.78] will be right like I started my uh programming adventure when I was 20 something well before my
[1117.78 → 1125.64] prefrontal cortex was fully formed so I'm not against that I mean I think what you said about
[1125.64 → 1132.56] how wonderful these years can be how formative they can be it 100 has value 100 something that
[1132.56 → 1138.16] I'd say anyone who's sort of cognitively inclined to pursue higher education should try to get
[1138.16 → 1144.84] but why would you pick the most expensive version of that right so you know what I'm going to make a
[1144.84 → 1151.34] computer parallel here I've been testing these mini pcs right and I bought this mini pc that's
[1151.34 → 1161.98] 313 from minis forum 313 I'm like holy shit i I make a lot of money I should just buy it the best
[1161.98 → 1167.14] right I buy this thing for 313 and like I fucking can't tell the difference I have a two thousand
[1167.14 → 1172.60] dollar computer next to it and a four thousand computer four thousand dollar computer next to that
[1172.60 → 1180.16] I can't tell the difference like if you're not just money is unlimited you're a retard if you buy the
[1180.16 → 1183.82] four thousand dollar computer if the three hundred and third or the thirteen dollar computer can do
[1183.82 → 1189.92] which that's how I look at American education like hey if you just do in-state if you just do in-state
[1189.92 → 1196.62] like what 80 of it is paid for yeah whatever the state rate is something like six seven eight grand
[1196.62 → 1200.98] or something seven grand a year for me, it's a lot closer to the Denmark model if you go in-state
[1200.98 → 1209.50] exactly, exactly because it's closer to just like sheer cost why would anyone who does not have the
[1209.50 → 1217.18] money just to throw around go into debt to get essentially the same product right like I understand
[1217.18 → 1221.32] there can be differences between colleges but for most people getting most educations like you know
[1221.32 → 1225.98] what if you're not really going to class or trying to learn, and you're just using you're going for the
[1225.98 → 1231.60] sort of the social experience and all that good stuff that's great but I think it's just
[1231.60 → 1241.56] there's a weird um prestige luxury product aspect of this that is just so actually repulsive in many
[1241.56 → 1246.72] ways when you think about what it is and what the consequences of it is like do you know what if you
[1246.72 → 1254.48] can afford to spend uh twenty thousand dollars on a watch and you just it's nothing to you great like
[1254.48 → 1262.86] do it yeah I've done that great i that's the spoils of having succeeded in some ways if you're
[1262.86 → 1267.08] spending twenty thousand dollars on a watch, and you're making like forty-five and forty-five thousand
[1267.08 → 1273.84] a year again you're a retard what are you doing that no the Casio which by the way Casio makes some
[1273.84 → 1280.26] sweet ass watches one of my favourite watches is an eighteen dollar Casio right where you pay twenty
[1280.26 → 1286.98] grand it tells the time worse it's a luxury item for people where money at that scale just doesn't
[1286.98 → 1291.26] matter right it's the same thing with education like don't do the out of the state thing
[1291.26 → 1296.98] unless your parents are paying for it unless there's some direct line where you can just see like all
[1296.98 → 1302.96] right if I do this it's going to open that door I want to work at whatever J.P. Morgan or some other
[1302.96 → 1311.62] company where I know the huddle goes through Yale or some other status token uh anyone else yeah it's
[1311.62 → 1319.56] just dumb so I guess I can we put some blame on the industry here though because I feel like if is
[1319.56 → 1325.34] the industry at large like let's say like you know a couple of these big companies you know Amazon
[1325.34 → 1330.44] Microsoft google whoever if they actually came out and said we're not going to look at college degrees
[1330.44 → 1335.10] any more period like hr is not going to use them for screening they're not going to get handed to
[1335.10 → 1340.60] the interviewer we're just they're off the resume we just white it out and send it on I think that
[1340.60 → 1347.48] would have a major effect like overnight on whether people because there probably are nowadays
[1347.48 → 1352.18] especially with thanks to the internet and YouTube and all these things where people can hear more
[1352.18 → 1358.44] opinions they get more information they can access other things I do think people would be like oh cool
[1358.44 → 1363.82] all right awesome then I'll just study on my own or I'll just work with some other people you know
[1363.82 → 1367.32] in a study group on the internet and I'll learn programming and I'll and I'll do this sort of stuff
[1367.32 → 1373.00] and then I know I won't be disadvantaged when I go to apply to one of these jobs, but the reality is that
[1373.00 → 1377.06] the hr departments who by the way none of them have any idea what programming is or how it works
[1377.06 → 1381.72] at all right I can just tell you this like they have no idea what a good programmer looks like none
[1381.72 → 1387.68] right they still use to do first pass screening and things like this they will use things like
[1387.68 → 1392.22] CS degrees and I've checked that recently like I've asked people at companies like that you know is
[1392.22 → 1399.54] that slab, and it is, and so I feel like we're we are to blame to some degree for still using this like
[1399.54 → 1406.48] expense plus attrition plus whatever you want to call the like filtering process that college is
[1406.48 → 1411.62] like could you grind through four years of having to listen to professors who themselves don't know how to
[1411.62 → 1417.42] tell you stuff and then still get through that after and pay eighty thousand dollars if you can
[1417.42 → 1423.50] maybe you're more slightly more likely to be a good employee for us so we're going to make you all do that
[1423.50 → 1428.70] first if we could get rid of that if we took it among ourselves to get rid of that I think it
[1428.70 → 1432.72] would be a much better world, but the industry isn't they're still doing that because there's a little
[1432.72 → 1437.02] bit of signal there I think probably right I think you're also I think there is we're confusing a
[1437.02 → 1441.54] little bit which is that there was a time in computer science when it was just computer science and
[1441.54 → 1447.00] programming was like the expression of computer science it's just like hey google we're doctorates
[1447.00 → 1452.44] we're researching better search algorithms oh wow we started a company hey we are a bunch of doctors
[1452.44 → 1456.58] and now we need to get other people to help us with this we should hire other doctors right like
[1456.58 → 1461.08] there's this actual computer science giving birth to something that was a product but most of the
[1461.08 → 1466.18] things that are happening today are more akin to a trades job like hey I need you to sit down and I need
[1466.18 → 1470.60] you to go to the pixel mines and swing that like pickaxe for the next eight hours to kind of just
[1470.60 → 1474.78] make some sort of progress on our product and then I want you to go home and then I'm going to call you
[1474.78 → 1478.86] at two in the morning when everything crashes and burns like that's what you're doing it's a 99 trade job
[1478.86 → 1484.64] it's a one percent like educational job whereas I think if you went backwards in time you would see
[1484.64 → 1490.98] much more hey this is closer related to research than it is uh closer related to a trades job, and so I think
[1490.98 → 1496.52] there's a're in this weird shift where we still have all the holding backs of the previous time
[1496.52 → 1500.22] and now we're in this kind of trades job because I'm sure there were other times that where this
[1500.22 → 1505.22] existed in other industries I'm sure it has happened but right now i that's right I mean I think that's
[1505.22 → 1510.60] why education is still accidentally important is that we still have this hold back it I mean I can go
[1510.60 → 1516.80] backwards in time I was born in 1976 and no you can go back it was never like it like there was never a
[1516.80 → 1522.66] time when the putting you know when actually dealing with the reality of computing didn't
[1522.66 → 1529.26] require the trades job part mostly like in fact if anything back then it was like if you weren't
[1529.26 → 1533.18] programming a semi-language you probably weren't really going to have a pretty well-functioning
[1533.18 → 1537.80] product right whereas nowadays, no one does that right I mean not no one the FFM peg team does
[1537.80 → 1542.94] right yeah and occasionally some of the people at rad game tools or whatever but everyone else right
[1542.94 → 1547.46] we write in something at least slightly higher even if we're doing performance stuff usually
[1547.46 → 1551.70] so I would say actually going back in time there was even less of an argument for CS
[1551.70 → 1556.76] yes it was a valuable thing to have a few people working on it, you know you wanted your new Dijkstra's
[1556.76 → 1561.58] and stuff like that doing work because we want to know stuff like how do we do the shortest path
[1561.58 → 1566.62] algorithms or things like that but generally speaking that's a very small number of people and you
[1566.62 → 1572.42] usually don't need very many of those people if any to make a software product even then you didn't need
[1572.42 → 1576.62] that many of those people to make a software product I would I I'd like to convince my man
[1576.62 → 1580.26] the other side for a second because there's too much agreement here and I don't like yes go for
[1580.26 → 1588.00] yeah go for it um do you know what I believe the 10x programmer is 100 real perhaps even an
[1588.00 → 1594.10] understatement because remember the 10x programmer is not saying that the best program is 10 times
[1594.10 → 1597.70] better than the average programmer it's saying that the best program is 10 times better than the
[1597.70 → 1603.72] the worst programmer I think that it's a vast understatement I think it's probably the 100x
[1603.72 → 1608.66] programmer is true or maybe even the thousand x program 10,000 x programmers I've seen some shitty
[1608.66 → 1614.76] programs written in my life and I'm like when I've looked at what that output is and I compared it to
[1614.76 → 1622.80] the best programs the best programmers I'm like I would not trade 10 of these idiots for one of these
[1622.80 → 1631.52] geniuses right well it's genius it's a worth way more so to steal my like what if and I don't fully
[1631.52 → 1636.44] believe this but I'm going to present it anyway what if the kinds of people who can make it through a
[1636.44 → 1644.46] Harvard CS degree were in the just abstract classical sense before DEI bullshit like this was actually the
[1644.46 → 1651.60] cream of the crop of the crop right like it was your perfect is sat score individual just like
[1651.60 → 1659.02] IQ 150 that individual has been filtered through because Harvard only has these few spots and like
[1659.02 → 1665.98] that they get the very best, and then you get to arm that person with a CS degree, and you let them loose
[1665.98 → 1672.56] on sort of run-of-the-mill software and what they do is they don't just they don't just do the thing
[1672.56 → 1678.24] right like they make a machine to build more of the things and that the leverage you get out of a
[1678.24 → 1685.10] 10 or 100x programmer is actually worth it now I don't actually think this is happening and I don't
[1685.10 → 1691.14] even think google knows it's not happening google did this multi-year study on their hiring processes
[1691.14 → 1696.36] where they were trying to figure out like what's the signal who ends up doing really well and who
[1696.36 → 1700.92] ends up not doing very well they didn't find a signal they couldn't go like oh it's because I have
[1700.92 → 1705.78] a MIT cheaper icon oh it's because they have this or that but at least the pursuit of it does make
[1705.78 → 1713.24] some sense in my mind because I've worked with a lot of programmers in my time and the capacity the
[1713.24 → 1719.60] productivity of the very best is just on a completely different plane so I don't I don't disagree that
[1719.60 → 1724.70] companies the very best companies the most valuable companies the richest companies in the world
[1724.70 → 1731.20] should try to find those because if you do find one they can do things that most people are not
[1731.20 → 1738.70] going to do now is your task worthy of that like if you're some regional office for a third tier
[1738.70 → 1744.28] rental company, and you just need to have your form updated like is that worth the super genius to apply
[1744.28 → 1752.30] to that problem probably not right like we need multiple layers of it um, but everyone also wants the
[1752.30 → 1757.76] the best right like they or they want the best that they can get so I don't actually i am little bit
[1757.76 → 1765.06] sympathize with the idea that the googles and the fangs and whatever who worth trillions would go like
[1765.06 → 1771.66] but think about the cost right this is the way I look at if it's like i I totally want them to be trying
[1771.66 → 1778.28] to get the best right and the problem is the college system doesn't do that filtering as far as I can tell
[1778.28 → 1783.42] and so what I would love is if they took it more seriously and went okay how do we build
[1783.42 → 1790.32] something because what we know is that you could spend eighty thousand dollars per person
[1790.32 → 1796.60] and still come out ahead on that filtering because that's how much Harvard or whatever is charging these
[1796.60 → 1801.66] people right now I think though it does get uncomfortable okay because if you're like what are the raw
[1801.66 → 1808.82] materials okay that's worth that kind of investment okay and I think and I didn't I've I've never taken
[1808.82 → 1812.88] an IQ test in my life and I'm kind of afraid that if I do one like I'm not going to like the result just
[1812.88 → 1817.16] do three of them you'll score super high you just once you do one you get a higher score every time
[1817.16 → 1822.32] I'm thinking 100 still no you take enough of them you'll be like I read this wonderful book about
[1822.32 → 1827.74] I went read this wonderful book about um the correlations with IQ and like it was actually kind of sort of
[1827.74 → 1837.68] depressing because the amount of set trajectories or at least um whatever confidence that originate out
[1837.68 → 1843.62] of that point is actually rather great and that means that there are simply there is a hardware
[1843.62 → 1848.92] difference right like some people can make up for a lack of hardware with some incredible other
[1848.92 → 1854.58] ingenuity but generally speaking if you take mass numbers you need a certain amount of hardware and
[1854.58 → 1860.88] that's partly what the sat is it's an IQ test by another name um that's what lead code is
[1860.88 → 1870.94] lead code is essentially hey here's an IQ test or an IQ derivative, and it sucks, but it's going to
[1870.94 → 1876.48] produce a signal that at least like this individual has the hardware to perform at the top level because
[1876.48 → 1884.40] you know what there's no amount of smart tricks you can do at like 95 like you're not it's just
[1884.40 → 1891.98] that's not going to be your profession it's just not it's not there right so I think um this all
[1891.98 → 1898.82] these ways we're searching for it to at least find this out of the potentials of the very best um
[1898.82 → 1906.42] tie into that notion that both college the admission to college and all the rest of it is
[1906.42 → 1912.46] essentially trying to sums out like who's the smart cookies again there's a million not there are many
[1912.46 → 1917.48] other variables you're right very few of them are as determined as that one you have a point
[1917.48 → 1922.48] there which is that at least in the U.S. I guess companies are sort of prohibited from using
[1922.48 → 1927.96] intelligence tests as part of hiring as part of like various sorts of civil rights legislations and
[1927.96 → 1933.28] things like this I guess I've heard it said anyway I've never actually looked to see what the case law
[1933.28 → 1939.76] is on it but that they're not allowed to actually administer something that's roughly like how smart is this
[1939.76 → 1946.54] person so yeah they're not right and so I guess you could tell me is you know if we want to be
[1946.54 → 1951.38] really blunt about it is this just a legal issue is it like does that just need to go, and then it's
[1951.38 → 1956.86] like they could put a screening process in place that would allow anyone who could show sufficient
[1956.86 → 1962.36] ability to get through it without paying the eighty thousand dollars uh or am I probably master
[1962.36 → 1965.90] say it two hundred thousand dollars I don't know what costs go to Harvard these days it's probably absurd
[1965.90 → 1970.44] I think it's in north and two hundred and why are you using Harvard I've actually never met a good
[1970.44 → 1974.42] programmer from Harvard maybe there are some all my Harvard experiences are actually horrible yeah
[1974.42 → 1980.82] Caltech all the programmers from Caltech are unbelievably good right yeah so yeah but so Caltech
[1980.82 → 1987.04] whatever it is but point being like whatever that cost is I feel like you know you would want some
[1987.04 → 1990.80] way that people could just demonstrate that they're they're good enough, and they've studied enough on
[1990.80 → 1994.68] their own to get through it without having to go through that whole process that simply isn't
[1994.68 → 1998.78] accessible for anyone who doesn't have a lot of money or isn't willing to go into a huge amount
[1998.78 → 2003.76] of debt which isn't good but also isn't that I mean and I'm not a fan of it and I fucking hate
[2003.76 → 2009.14] algorithm in general right but isn't that what lead code is like lead code essentially if you can
[2009.14 → 2017.38] crack the top tiers of that I mean unless you're doing it with AI it is an intelligence test it is a filter
[2017.38 → 2021.76] and I think at least from what I've heard from a lot of hiring processes a lot of it has sort of
[2021.76 → 2027.22] leaned heavily into that that that becomes a qualifier if you can really smash lead code and
[2027.22 → 2032.66] have the tenacity and the time and whatever and the firepower up here between your neurons
[2032.66 → 2039.18] to grind it for three months, and we're able to do those hard like at the very least maybe you're not
[2039.18 → 2043.74] a great programmer which I actually think there's something to that too I met some very, very smart
[2043.74 → 2050.36] people who are also programmers who I would not want to program my code yeah right correct but
[2050.36 → 2056.14] I mean I'd say on average you'd rather want a smart person than a not so smart person working
[2056.14 → 2062.30] next to you um as a programmer so I think maybe actually the industry what happened with lead code
[2062.30 → 2068.70] was some sense of trying to get towards that right can we just route around the fact that
[2068.70 → 2073.82] universities are actually no longer I should say all that great of a filter like they're broken in
[2073.82 → 2081.12] all these ways they're not as meritocratic and as focused on um objective scores as they once were
[2081.12 → 2085.90] and therefore they're not a great signal here's another kind of signal which by the way has been
[2085.90 → 2092.74] completely blown out of the water right like AI killed lead code right so yes I'm going to go with an
[2092.74 → 2099.04] opposite take on this one which is uh i I don't like the idea of intelligence tests um because i
[2099.04 → 2104.18] think that intelligent tests one thing that they largely lack the ability of is to identify wisdom
[2104.18 → 2110.08] in somebody I'd much rather hire a wise not so smart programmer who's going to make the right decision
[2110.08 → 2115.72] given enough time than I would to hire the super smart person that can make fast decisions but their
[2115.72 → 2120.24] decisions may be incredibly unwise because I always define just for everybody intelligence is the ability
[2120.24 → 2125.78] to solve a problem wisdom is the ability to know which problem to solve right like which one
[2125.78 → 2131.20] would you rather have and i I don't think there is a standardized test that's going to be like and
[2131.20 → 2136.10] this right here is how wise you are here's your wise score sir right because it's just gonna it's just
[2136.10 → 2140.62] going to be completely broken it's going to be absolutely a crap test and so for me, I don't like the idea of
[2140.62 → 2146.60] like gated things based on some sort of nebulous scoring especially when it comes to things like IQ or
[2146.60 → 2151.44] leak code because the reason why I specifically don't like those is any of those tests you take
[2151.44 → 2155.92] them more than once you'll do better like that's a fundamentally broken test that if you're like hey
[2155.92 → 2160.30] how intelligence is this person let's make him take a test okay they did something let's make him take
[2160.30 → 2164.56] another test they are now proportionally better than they were the last time they've done it there's
[2164.56 → 2168.86] something a bit broken that's a very well-studied phenomenon if you'd have if you just get you can move
[2168.86 → 2173.60] it you're not going to move it that much, but you're still going to move it, but 10 points is a generation of
[2173.60 → 2178.02] of intelligence like it doesn't you're not gonna you're not going to move IQ 10 points I mean I'll
[2178.02 → 2182.38] send you the I sent you some references on this topic because I mean what's interesting about
[2182.38 → 2190.84] IQ testing is its one of the few areas of psychology that replicates um where basically like
[2190.84 → 2197.02] everything else done in the last goddamn 80 years seems to fail replication time and again um IQ testing
[2197.02 → 2203.94] and it's um correlation with positive outcomes and other aspects of life and professional
[2203.94 → 2209.20] performance is very well established not to a total degree and I completely agree with you in
[2209.20 → 2214.22] the sense that like I met some very smart people who are also incredibly stupid right like they have
[2214.22 → 2220.26] the firepower, but it's not been programmed well right like there's like hey you have to you got an
[2220.26 → 2225.22] m4 chip here, and you're running some shitty ass software on it like this chip could do amazing
[2225.22 → 2231.42] things, and you're not doing that um now either way I think the fundamental problem is no one has
[2231.42 → 2237.22] cracked hiring and I say that as someone who's currently in the final stages of trying to hire
[2237.22 → 2245.38] three programmers um two we're trying to hire who are juniors and one who's a senior and fuck it's
[2245.38 → 2251.02] really difficult it's really goddamn difficult, and it's actually only gotten more difficult now that
[2251.02 → 2258.14] the best test that we've used for years and years which is sort of an at-home programming test um not
[2258.14 → 2264.22] even test yeah well maybe it is you build a product or something at home and just we give you a constrained
[2264.22 → 2269.94] uh part of one of our applications like something that resembles the work you would be doing day to
[2269.94 → 2276.94] day, and we ask you to extend it in some specific ways and I've always found it so fascinating how this
[2276.94 → 2282.36] test has been able to reveal to me almost right away whether I would want to work with this person
[2282.36 → 2287.78] or not in ways that all the other signals as you say like oh this person went to Yale like I'd be
[2287.78 → 2292.88] actually inclined to go if you could make it through a four-year program at an Ivy League institution
[2292.88 → 2298.90] at least historically you would have to be pretty smart so that's a good signal it's just it's not
[2298.90 → 2304.24] it's not the determinant signal to me the determinant signal and now I can look back upon 25 years of
[2304.24 → 2309.82] hiring other people hiring other programmers seeing someone work with the real kind of code they'll be
[2309.82 → 2316.08] working on a day-to-day basis with me is I've found no better measure the problem with that is a
[2316.08 → 2324.18] it's hard to do at scale so the test that we ask applicants to do they take like four to six
[2324.18 → 2329.72] hours i not only do they take four to six hours which is a lot to ask for someone who's applying for
[2329.72 → 2335.68] a job you better well be quite a ways down the pipeline before that request comes up right like
[2335.68 → 2340.44] you don't want to give that test to a thousand people it also takes quite a while to assess it
[2340.44 → 2349.24] right so I can't process a thousand uh applications that had that kind of uh test in it um so it's a late
[2349.24 → 2359.54] stage but really nice test and now i kind of fear AI fucked it yeah right oh absolutely but I mean
[2359.54 → 2363.14] I say that and then we actually this last test we were just about to get we gave it to all the
[2363.14 → 2368.48] models right like every I think we did like six models like all right solve the thing and some of
[2368.48 → 2373.22] the models you're like do you know what that's not actually bad and what was interesting about it was
[2373.22 → 2378.86] the solutions that model come up with would be quite reminiscent of a lot of junior code and you're
[2378.86 → 2384.82] like shit we're trying to hire junior programmers and if I can't tell anymore whether it's AI doing it
[2384.82 → 2388.52] or not because I'm giving a lot of allowances right if you're hiring a junior programmer you're not
[2388.52 → 2394.28] going to ask the same things none of the models were even remotely close to the bar I would set
[2394.28 → 2399.72] for a senior programmer in terms of like the code and so on that i I heard there's not just a new
[2399.72 → 2405.90] whatever Claude four or sonnet four just drop that people are freaking out about in my feet so maybe
[2405.90 → 2413.04] maybe now we're all the way up there but at the junior end of scale i it's really hard how are you
[2413.04 → 2417.38] going to figure out who you're going to give a chance yeah well I would also I do want to rewind a
[2417.38 → 2422.74] little bit can we really rewind yeah I wanted to rewind with you prime actually um okay where so
[2422.74 → 2429.08] where are you rewinding to just I would like to be a touch more focused on college more itself in the
[2429.08 → 2433.58] sense that we haven't quite answered if college is worth it we've all I think we all universally
[2433.58 → 2438.54] agree you probably shouldn't go four hundred thousand dollars into debt over especially over
[2438.54 → 2443.32] an education that is like largely based in trades if you will with programming like I think there is a
[2443.32 → 2448.14] good argument to be made in that, but there's also the argument that there are countries where you
[2448.14 → 2452.66] you must get a degree if you expect anything like if you go to India if you were born and raised
[2452.66 → 2456.90] in India you can't just be like ah I'm just not going to get a degree and succeed like they don't
[2456.90 → 2461.04] have a know a culture around that you're going to largely fail simply because you didn't go to
[2461.04 → 2464.92] school, so there are also immigration like a lot of countries immigration requirements including the
[2464.92 → 2469.60] United States you get preferential treatment if you have a degree in something that you're
[2469.60 → 2474.60] getting hired for you will get preferential treatment in many countries because the government
[2474.60 → 2480.94] uses that as a standard for competence and what I would say is the reason I think we're talking about
[2480.94 → 2485.88] the screening process part though prime is because that's the problem is that companies
[2485.88 → 2492.30] don't have the ability to put in a good screening process I understand your uh your um
[2492.30 → 2496.40] uneasiness with something like an IQ test and i kind of share that with you because
[2496.40 → 2502.26] one of the problems I find so what I'm no eugenicist as I can't eugenics all that is
[2502.26 → 2507.28] IQ is based no I just can't sure yeah I mean whatever there's a there's a bad history but also I think
[2507.28 → 2512.52] the process has a couple issues too which is that because they're trying to do a standardized test with
[2512.52 → 2519.46] something like an IQ test they're focusing on your ability to concentrate on very small problems so
[2519.46 → 2524.66] problems that have very low scope and especially in the world of programming one of the things that I find
[2524.66 → 2529.78] that people who I would consider very smart but are terrible programmers usually the reason for that
[2529.78 → 2535.32] is their ability to conceptualize large scope does not exist like they're a bit like they're the degree
[2535.32 → 2540.44] to which they can spend a lot of time thinking about larger things or to hold the larger things in their
[2540.44 → 2546.50] head is compromised for whatever reason, but they do have tremendous firepower on a tiny thing so you
[2546.50 → 2549.52] know that's not to say they're necessarily going to be a horrible programmer at all things you could
[2549.52 → 2554.52] you could really clearly just go optimize this loop or something, and maybe they could really do that
[2554.52 → 2559.74] because it's so tiny but when you're talking about I want someone you know like um David was saying
[2559.74 → 2563.44] senior programmer someone who's going to conceptualize the system and know like not to do stupid stuff
[2563.44 → 2568.02] they can't do that right even if there may be high IQ because they can't hold the whole thing in their
[2568.02 → 2573.78] head right whereas um some of the other things like is what could this person be a great novelist or
[2573.78 → 2578.86] something that actually probably bears more on could you be a great systems architect because
[2578.86 → 2582.52] you're holding all these things in your head and knowing how some fuzzy things will
[2582.52 → 2587.14] interrelate with each other and will they play out well and so while I share your concern about
[2587.14 → 2593.04] that I would say it's still no matter what you think the screening thing is its still a screening
[2593.04 → 2597.64] problem at the end of the day and outsourcing that screening by saying what we're going to do
[2597.64 → 2602.82] is had this four-year thing that kids go to that they pay all this money for, and then they get a degree
[2602.82 → 2609.48] and by the way the entrance to that is basically an IQ test it's just it's ridiculous right it's not it's a
[2609.48 → 2616.14] nonsensical solution to this problem that probably made sense in the past when it was hard to bring
[2616.14 → 2621.86] people together right you having professors in one place to work on stuff together made a lot of sense
[2621.86 → 2627.66] before the internet right nowadays it's like do we need these antiquated ideas of buildings where the
[2627.66 → 2632.20] people gather like can we do something better and can we do something better than charging people
[2632.20 → 2636.90] two hundred thousand dollars or whatever to go to certain ones with limited accessibility so only
[2636.90 → 2641.38] three thousand people can go through it blah blah blah blah blah it's like it just seems antiquated
[2641.38 → 2647.32] like a horse and buggy and my question is just can we make that pipeline that's part screening part
[2647.32 → 2652.72] education can we make it better and I think the answer has to be yes, and unfortunately we're not
[2652.72 → 2657.96] trying that's what I would say IQ test aside i I think you're also focusing on we're focusing on
[2657.96 → 2663.80] unique colleges um there are a good university right now uh you may not I know it's gonna sound like I'm
[2663.80 → 2668.70] just kind of toot my own horn here but the uh school of mines in South Dakota a've been uh
[2668.70 → 2674.24] in the ACM world competition with there's only been like what 17 of them 20 of them has been hosted here
[2674.24 → 2679.38] because of that because of how good this school is at like just problem-solving right but on top of it
[2679.38 → 2685.14] every single graduating class universally gets just hired out by google every single time all 50 just go
[2685.14 → 2689.64] straight to google straight into this pipeline, and so I do think there are some schools that are just
[2689.64 → 2694.96] objectively better, and they have created a culture and everybody that goes to the school it's not just
[2694.96 → 2698.00] about learning because that's I think that's one thing that we're kind of breaking down this is why
[2698.00 → 2704.42] IQ tests again fail completely is that a job is not simply your ability to apply knowledge it is also
[2704.42 → 2709.36] your ability to like interact with others, and you will never get that in the day and age of on the
[2709.36 → 2715.06] internet that's why I think like discord as great as it is also really kind of bad thing for a lot of
[2715.06 → 2719.72] people because they abstain from having real relationships real interactions being able to
[2719.72 → 2724.28] look somebody in the eye and talk to somebody for a while, and instead they have this kind of nice
[2724.28 → 2729.18] filtered screen, and they don't ever have to do that i actually during college one of my interviews was
[2729.18 → 2735.68] for uh the naval underwater warfare group up in Seattle and the reason why I got selected out of all
[2735.68 → 2740.16] the kids to go and do the like the on-site interview is the lady was like you're the only person that looked
[2740.16 → 2745.10] in my eyes while you talked to me not a single other student made eye contact the entire time
[2745.10 → 2750.90] and it's just like I won by simply being sociable like that's how I got in so it had nothing to do
[2750.90 → 2754.94] with whether I was smart or not I would like to think I was smart but nonetheless it's just because
[2754.94 → 2760.48] I was able to just talk to another human being which is a skill I fundamentally received by being
[2760.48 → 2765.64] around people my age doing the same thing solving the same problems I think that's where like the real
[2765.64 → 2769.62] again that's where I think a lot of the value is that I think it's just in the group
[2769.62 → 2773.92] with some sort of smart person hopefully at the head leading people TJ you haven't said a single
[2773.92 → 2778.20] thing so TJ you got to get in thanks I've been trying, but you know you keep it you keep hopping
[2778.20 → 2781.80] in prime it's just been years I got another thing to say and I'd like to say right now no okay go I'm
[2781.80 → 2786.84] going to mute you right now uh I have that power so prime you can talk again in a little while uh no I'm
[2786.84 → 2794.78] just kidding uh do that I have to touch riverside and ruin everything anyway so um the thing that it feels
[2794.78 → 2800.08] like, so often there's there are two things that I feel like for some reason a lot of hiring doesn't
[2800.82 → 2804.78] at least try and factor in I don't know how you do it I've I've had experience with doing the take
[2804.78 → 2808.96] home project before that's my favourite interview that I've ever had it was at the first startup that
[2808.96 → 2814.56] I worked on submitted it at the end of the week blah blah blah it was great they paid me for my time
[2814.56 → 2820.38] which was cool because it was a big ask whatever um, but one is like what you're saying prime
[2820.38 → 2826.42] programming like in a company is way more than like typing into the computer you have to like
[2826.42 → 2830.74] figure out what your customers want what your clients want what other people on your team want
[2830.74 → 2836.08] what historical decisions were made for the company because of differing business expectations
[2836.08 → 2841.68] six months ago or a year ago or 10 years ago or 40 years ago depending on where you work and like
[2841.68 → 2847.96] what are the things that are coming up, so there's a bunch of like social and like relational
[2847.96 → 2853.66] things and like a lot of businesses relationships anyway outside just like can you even get your
[2853.66 → 2859.28] product working it's like why does someone stay with your product or whatever so and like you know
[2859.28 → 2864.52] a bunch of these have no factor it seems like they're just like the only way they test that is the first
[2864.52 → 2868.96] phone screen where they're like oh are you a human and like you talk to some hr person, and they're like
[2868.96 → 2875.68] cool uh you can accurately reflect your birthdate and your name congratulations you've made it past the
[2875.68 → 2880.30] first round, and you're like that was it that's that's the only thing we're going to find out if
[2880.30 → 2886.40] I want to work with this guy later um and then the second thing which is kind of like it's related to
[2886.40 → 2892.50] the idea of like 10x programming is that like the worst software developers are like way negative x
[2892.50 → 2896.98] programming in the sense that they not only do they not do the thing you're looking for they actively
[2896.98 → 2904.08] set your entire company back either by like literally taking down prod all the time like the most obvious
[2904.08 → 2910.30] one, but they can just make code that makes it worse to write more code in the future so it's not only
[2910.30 → 2916.12] that oh well we just had to wait six months and billy finally finished the feature it would have been
[2916.12 → 2921.16] cool if that was six days, but it took six months it's like no billy took six weeks to make this and
[2921.16 → 2928.12] now no one else can ship to prod no like no one else can figure out what billy did, and now it's broken
[2928.12 → 2935.98] forever so that like and the long tail of that is like there's a lot of area under that curve of
[2935.98 → 2943.50] people I have like worked with or seen where they actively just make the entire product uh worse and
[2943.50 → 2950.42] then the last thing too is that there are some scales where you can't even compare like for me, I can't run
[2950.42 → 2955.88] a marathon like I like physically I wouldn't be able to like finish one I would get eliminated I would
[2955.88 → 2959.72] get disqualified right like I wouldn't be able to finish literally can't get disqualified but
[2959.72 → 2963.46] somehow you would figure it out TJ well they like to close it down at some point they're like people
[2963.46 → 2968.98] have to drive on the road again you know it's DNF did not finish yeah this exists in a marathon yeah
[2968.98 → 2975.40] and that's the same thing is true for a bunch of software projects I've worked with people who like
[2975.40 → 2981.90] no matter how much time you gave them no matter how whatever they're just not ever going to fix
[2981.90 → 2987.70] this particular problem due to technical complexity or handling all the scope or like
[2987.70 → 2994.40] figuring out the way that the customer actually wants to use the thing so that's like infinity x
[2994.40 → 3002.16] programmer like the there 's's no comparison it's it never happens or someday it happens there's
[3002.16 → 3008.44] infinity difference between the two and like all of those things it feels like just it doesn't seem
[3008.44 → 3011.72] like people care about maybe it's because hr departments at the big companies are in charge
[3011.72 → 3015.38] of a lot of the hiring process I don't know that's where I feel like I'm taking crazy pills over here
[3015.38 → 3019.76] can I say one thing really quick before we get in too much like the before the YouTube comments just
[3019.76 → 3025.60] fill up yeah it'd be an undefined difference between programmers not infinity because I just know
[3025.60 → 3031.28] I know that's going to be the top comment if I don't say that so okay keep going okay I'll go get
[3031.28 → 3037.38] my math degree out and then I'll have to burn it because I have a divide by zero yeah right I have a
[3037.38 → 3042.60] mathematics major and I failed them sorry, sorry uh because it's a divide by zero right so you have
[3042.60 → 3047.46] you know you've got this person finished it in six days and this person will never finish it so
[3047.46 → 3052.62] it's six over zero is the dip is the ratio between those two, and it's not infinity
[3052.62 → 3056.58] times zero will never be six I mean I'm sure there is a mathematician somewhere who's like actually
[3056.58 → 3061.54] in this particular type of group it is and I'm like so that will be the second top comment
[3061.54 → 3065.86] so I had to say that as well but i just that mathematician so it's approaching infinity
[3065.86 → 3071.42] oh go ahead Brian no it's just undefined it cannot infinity this is not you want a mathematician not
[3071.42 → 3076.94] me to tell you this so, but it's undefined because there's no there is no ability to reach it period
[3076.94 → 3082.80] not at infinity it will never happen this discussion is the zero x programmer one who never
[3082.80 → 3093.42] finishes all right anyway go ahead well yeah so anyway, so those are just some of the things where I feel
[3093.42 → 3099.66] like college can help you in some of those verticals right where like you can get some skills
[3099.66 → 3106.00] for learning how to work with people if you're like actually trying at college like I went to a small
[3106.00 → 3113.00] liberal arts college I lived at home to save money and like you know didn't have to pay room and board
[3113.00 → 3118.50] thanks mom and dad shout out mom and dad they didn't make me pay rent while I was living at home uh you
[3118.50 → 3123.80] know and like but I did activities at school I met people I made relationships talked to my professors
[3123.80 → 3128.84] you know like they helped me get internships whatever I learned how to work with people and
[3128.84 → 3134.22] make connections awesome those things would have been a lot harder for me like otherwise because my dad's
[3134.22 → 3141.24] an accountant, and he doesn't know anybody my family is far from tech adjacent you know like you know
[3141.24 → 3146.96] my mom's a music teacher and my dad's an accountant right like there was no connections to get into
[3146.96 → 3152.06] like software world so like that can be that first vertical can help you out a lot in college if
[3152.06 → 3156.62] you're paying attention and trying, but you could also spend your whole day on discord like you're
[3156.62 → 3162.20] saying prime playing video games and never talking to a real human at school which seems crazy it seems
[3162.20 → 3166.18] like that would be impossible, but it's definitely possible twitch chat can back us up half of them are
[3166.18 → 3171.98] that guy go out and talk to somebody um right and then it can also help you with some of the other
[3171.98 → 3176.82] problems because you can like talk to your professors and figure out how these like you could just
[3176.82 → 3181.08] you got to do some of those things though it's not going to be the school handing those to you, I think
[3181.08 → 3191.04] yeah for me the bottom line here is uh if you I mean we're talking to programmers here if you aspire to
[3191.04 → 3198.76] be a programmer I think going to college is totally worth it at the right price, and it's all about the
[3198.76 → 3205.40] price like a product isn't bad or good mode I mean some products are just terrible at any price
[3205.40 → 3211.80] but a lot of things that exist in this world are bad or good depending on how much they cost right
[3211.80 → 3217.40] like you have completely different expectations about what you get out of something if you didn't
[3217.40 → 3224.92] spend the next 20 years worth of salary on it if it was something more affordable more approachable
[3224.92 → 3230.86] I'd say it'd be far more of a no-brainer I there are a lot of kids in the U.S. where I just feel like
[3230.86 → 3238.10] no it wasn't worth it for you even if you got like a decent education it the price was just too high
[3238.10 → 3242.90] yeah it's like Warren Buffett uh always said like there's not a good or bad stock there's just a good
[3242.90 → 3248.32] or bad price for it again caveats of company going out of business is literally worth zero but
[3248.32 → 3254.92] with almost everything it's all about what is the price yeah and I think too like the opportunity cost
[3254.92 → 3260.68] like I was just talking with a guy who was in the middle of school and then I don't know if I can
[3260.68 → 3265.98] say the company some nice company that is doing well offered to hire him, and so he just left school
[3265.98 → 3272.60] and then he's working there, and it's like the opportunity cost was gone stay at school and maybe
[3272.60 → 3276.78] get the same job later or just like go there and work for two years and then if he needs to he can go
[3276.78 → 3282.14] finish the other two years of school awesome good for him, I was like dude that's so awesome I'm so hyped
[3282.14 → 3287.36] for you, he's moving to San Francisco he's going to go do his thing like that's perfect I tried to
[3287.36 → 3291.46] convince my younger sister she's 10 years younger than I am she just graduated from school but when she
[3291.46 → 3297.84] was starting I was like yo I will, you can come work with me for four years, and you only have to pay me
[3297.84 → 3305.76] half of what your tuition was, and she didn't take me up on the offer but I was like a little bit
[3305.76 → 3310.56] serious actually that if she really wanted to like to try and work with me like we could do basically
[3310.56 → 3314.32] like a tradesman thing I wouldn't have actually charged her money I wish there was more of that
[3314.32 → 3319.68] I was just talking to someone about that that programming in general seems exceedingly well
[3319.68 → 3326.20] suited for the apprenticeship model exactly for all the reasons you guys were mentioning that this is
[3326.20 → 3332.60] more of a trade in many ways if you take the total sum of all programmers out there the vast majority
[3332.60 → 3338.96] of them are trades people, and they would learn quicker better if they were apprenticing under
[3338.96 → 3344.28] someone yeah and I was like your resume will look cooler like you have real job experience for four
[3344.28 → 3351.66] years as opposed to like one little degree spot that gets discarded like at a lot of places um but
[3351.66 → 3355.74] there were other you know there were other factors or whatever but I was like I would, you know that
[3355.74 → 3360.64] would have been cool like to be able to do that and I think if there were more options like this
[3360.64 → 3365.98] or ways for this to happen it would be really exciting to see because I think like the tradesmen
[3365.98 → 3371.06] like I have a bunch of friends one of my buddy one semester of college was like this sucks
[3371.06 → 3379.18] quit started plumbing immediately he was a professional plumber long before I graduated from school
[3379.18 → 3384.96] was doing great owned a house married you know the whole thing, and it's like that was awesome for him
[3384.96 → 3389.58] but they do the apprenticeship model he went, and he followed a plumber around and did plumbing things
[3389.58 → 3394.42] you know, and it's like that would have been way better if those opportunities I think existed in
[3394.42 → 3401.88] programming more often do you think so do you think spending four years at an accredited place
[3401.88 → 3408.32] in the site of AI now that it's coming down and all that do you think that it is still just
[3408.32 → 3415.52] practically worth it at the right price yes I want to say that what David said is exactly the way to
[3415.52 → 3421.26] think of if it's like it, you have to know how much you're spending and if you don't know how
[3421.26 → 3425.30] much you're spending on it then I don't think you could make that decision because it certainly does
[3425.30 → 3430.62] change the equation it means that now like you know if you don't think you're going to be very good
[3430.62 → 3436.94] at this thing eventually then a high price school is simply not it should never really be considered
[3436.94 → 3442.84] at that point right because AI will be AI will be taking some of the hiring away presumably right
[3442.84 → 3448.52] uh if for no other reason than like the junior programmer thing where it's like if you have
[3448.52 → 3452.78] someone who's never really going to get all that good well AI at least what I've seen of the
[3452.78 → 3457.78] programming from AI it looks like somebody I would never hire but that I know does work at a number of
[3457.78 → 3463.02] these companies right that's what AI looks like it looks like I would never let this thing
[3463.02 → 3467.90] anywhere near any code I was working on but I know a ton of code bases where this is just a like
[3467.90 → 3473.76] accepted commit right the Microsoft start menu right oh yeah like for example this thing you know the
[3473.76 → 3478.80] the AI could just produce the same quality as that right like you know brought to you that by the
[3478.80 → 3484.20] people who said that it would take a very long time for them to figure out how to make it uh so that
[3484.20 → 3488.90] you could put it back on the top again like it used to that was like a huge thing they were like well
[3488.90 → 3493.84] there's a lot of work that would have to go into that I'm like yes that's the AI would be operating at
[3493.84 → 3500.06] about the same level as that start menu right um but I guess I would say that does affect the market
[3500.06 → 3507.26] though because plenty of programmers were currently in that tranche of you know not very good and so
[3507.26 → 3512.52] that does remove that does change the market dynamics even if AI never really gets any better
[3512.52 → 3517.42] than today it still changes those market dynamics at least a little bit which means that price that
[3517.42 → 3522.60] you should be looking for is going to change that price for education can't be as high it has to be a
[3522.60 → 3527.14] little bit less if is economics is you know if economics works the way we think it does right
[3527.14 → 3531.72] and the other opportunities can't be like as good that's the other thing that I feel like
[3531.72 → 3539.02] because if more people are like hiring or like trying to do apprenticeship or like you can even just
[3539.02 → 3543.82] try like I'm not a huge boot camp guy or anything but like you could try a boot camp for way less money
[3543.82 → 3549.86] and see if you can get hired for it like, and you grind on that for a year instead of going to school
[3549.86 → 3558.60] like just even making money for three years instead of paying money at like any ratio is like that adds
[3558.60 → 3564.92] up really fast like even if you're making 40 000 and not spending 10 yeah that's 200k difference in
[3564.92 → 3570.10] your life like that's a lot of money you know so the other opportunities I'm interested to see what's
[3570.10 → 3576.62] going to happen with like AI and with what is software development going to look like what or
[3576.62 → 3582.30] like what our crud software development jobs going to look like you know because there's a huge portion
[3582.30 → 3585.90] of the market where it's like I don't know I don't know what that's going to look like market yeah
[3585.90 → 3590.94] they're just like market firms that just build simple sites for people that's a big thing and people
[3590.94 → 3597.62] need them so yeah all right um there's a common thing that everybody says and I'd love to get
[3597.62 → 3603.66] everyone's prime gotta go soon okay uh DJ do you want your 15 seconds super hot take on this one
[3603.66 → 3609.90] shoot every single programmer says that they want to be a farmer are they delusional or is it true
[3609.90 → 3618.44] uh they're absolutely delusional I don't think most programs that have actually ever spend a day on a
[3618.44 → 3624.20] farm looking at what it is but I also do I do think there's something true in it in the sense that
[3624.20 → 3630.70] working with a computer all day can be alienating in a sense that I don't actually get from
[3630.70 → 3637.16] as many people as I know who have worked farming that it isn't deeply alienating in the same way so
[3637.16 → 3642.12] I totally get the aspiration but i I think it is delusional and the vast majority of people
[3642.12 → 3648.20] actually would do better not to test that delusion because it's the delusion that gives them hope
[3648.20 → 3652.50] do you know what life sucks right now this week sucks right now, but you know what I can imagine
[3652.50 → 3659.04] I could be a farmer and I'd be happy and if you test out that delusion, and you find out it's not true
[3659.04 → 3665.52] at all, and you can't hack it for four hours milking cows what are you left with no hope at all right
[3665.52 → 3671.24] like total nihilism so like keep your little illusions around like keep them little jars of delusion
[3671.24 → 3677.64] of illusions because if you take them down and examining them too uh close you might find like
[3677.64 → 3683.58] yeah do you know what a little alienation can uh get replaced real quick by existential dread
[3683.58 → 3690.56] love it that was absolutely a great ending all right thanks so much for having me on that was
[3690.56 → 3696.44] really uh thanks for coming yes my pleasure today's show was sponsored by code rabbit and so i just
[3696.44 → 3700.56] wanted to take a quick little moment to shout them out developers are you tired of getting code reviews
[3700.56 → 3706.58] that just say GTM or nit please take these seven things hey your variable name is res it should be
[3706.58 → 3713.06] result and reject no uh meet code rabbit AI reviews right inside your editor starting with VS Code
[3713.06 → 3719.32] cursor and windsurf sorry no vim yet I know my heart is broken to hit review and bam feedback appears before
[3719.32 → 3725.98] you even open a poll request code rabbit can help you flag the bugs your vibe cod elm bot missed and with

[3737.06 → 3745.40] coderabbit. Link slash primo gen dash VS Code and ship cleaner code today link in the description link in
[3745.40 → 3752.08] the description in the future thanks DJ oh yes it worked I just dude I set up a second scene for
[3752.08 → 3756.54] three people just to see if this would work and oh my gosh it worked let's go let's go I did not expect
[3756.54 → 3764.44] this to work anyway uh hey that was awesome by the way no I are we ready I had never met him before
[3764.44 → 3769.26] and he what a fantastic guest oh my god he was he is one of my favourite people in the universe are we
[3769.26 → 3773.96] still live yeah we're still live okay all right just making sure yeah I thought we were still live
[3773.96 → 3780.78] yeah I meant to say that live if uh is possible because i I really enjoyed it I really enjoyed what
[3780.78 → 3786.64] he had to say yeah no i absolutely uh I absolutely am just in just a huge fan of what he has to say
[3786.64 → 3791.42] and I think he's right on a huge portion of things now I'm still not on your guys team with
[3791.42 → 3796.58] the whole IQ test thing but i do appreciate about IQ so don't lump me into anybody well like I said
[3796.58 → 3802.34] that was more his thing than mine because like i said i I don't feel like it captures I don't
[3802.34 → 3808.48] feel like IQ tests capture what I'm really looking for in a programmer because they would only really
[3808.48 → 3814.54] tell me like how hyper fixated they can be on small things so like I don't know, and you know
[3814.54 → 3819.40] I'm not up on the psychology research here maybe it's true that IQ generalizes out to that
[3819.40 → 3825.44] more or less like or as well as any other test we have and that could be true but at least for me
[3825.44 → 3831.72] I prefer screening to be something more action oriented like okay here's this like larger pool of
[3831.72 → 3838.10] things go sort through it figure out how to do something with it right and uh that kind of stuff
[3838.10 → 3841.90] if you were going to do something for screening I would think it would be more like that and not
[3841.90 → 3848.34] like an IQ test but i so I'm not really I'm not on the same page uh as DHH was I guess if is he's
[3848.34 → 3853.12] actually suggesting that an IQ test would be useful but I am on the same page in the term in the terms
[3853.12 → 3858.62] of like it is'd be better even an IQ test would be better than the system we have now so I think now
[3858.62 → 3866.44] it's just saying bad college is like a very roundabout method of like right IQ plus some other stuff I would
[3866.44 → 3873.66] also say I've definitely seen and or seen some code by 155 IQ Haskell geniuses yeah that nobody
[3873.66 → 3878.12] in the world should have ever written and should be wiped from the face of the earth yeah so if
[3878.12 → 3884.40] it's just IQ then they would get hired, and they would bring the company to an end goodbye that's
[3884.40 → 3887.20] the end of the episode right now bye everybody
[3887.20 → 3889.36] boot up the day
[3889.36 → 3894.12] vibe caught in errors on my screen
[3894.12 → 3896.98] terminal coffee
[3896.98 → 3901.88] live in the dream
[3901.88 → 3904.62] you
