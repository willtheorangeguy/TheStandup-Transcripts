[0.24 → 4.14] Hey, hi. TJ, you sound like you're talking on like one and a half speed.
[5.52 → 8.42] Hello, it's me, TJ. I hung out with you too much, probably.
[8.72 → 11.58] I know, you're like talking fast. What is this?
[13.06 → 15.08] I'm from Massachusetts. We all talk fast.
[16.78 → 20.16] Is that a thing? Oh, yeah. Massachusetts doesn't just go to car in the pot.
[20.72 → 22.96] Well, that's the accent, but also everyone talks.
[23.74 → 26.12] Trash, can you do that again? Because that was the worst.
[26.96 → 29.22] Trash, do that the whole episode, please.
[30.00 → 33.92] I can only say car in the pot. That's all I can do.
[33.94 → 34.90] Where do you park the car?
[35.98 → 37.20] Harvard Yard, of course.
[37.40 → 39.48] Yeah, Harvard Yard. You pack the car in Harvard Yard.
[39.70 → 40.12] In what?
[40.50 → 41.48] In Harvard Yard.
[44.50 → 45.56] Harvard Yard.
[45.90 → 46.90] Oh, Harvard Yard.
[48.90 → 52.82] Hey, welcome to The Stand-Up. We are having a very special episode today.
[52.82 → 56.58] Today, we have Casey Moratoria, very common guest on this show.
[56.58 → 59.60] And he apparently has a bit of a keyboard affinity.
[59.84 → 62.52] And we're going to be chatting about keyboards today.
[62.62 → 66.10] Also with me is TJ, Bellatrix, Wizard, and Trash.
[66.28 → 70.76] He has one password for his entire family, and it's been leaked several times.
[71.44 → 73.16] We appreciate you conserving.
[73.30 → 74.38] It's kind of like eco-friendly.
[74.62 → 74.88] It is.
[74.88 → 77.60] Like, he's saving the environment one password at a time.
[77.60 → 78.76] Oh, I like that.
[79.14 → 80.06] One password.
[84.60 → 85.42] Anyway, sorry.
[85.62 → 89.34] Is that a gentle pour-over you're doing there, Prime?
[89.34 → 90.90] I am doing a little bit of a pour-over right now.
[90.96 → 93.18] I just figured a little bit of coffee for the stand-up would be a good move.
[93.54 → 94.20] Very nice.
[94.34 → 95.22] That is fancy.
[95.70 → 96.94] Are we filming a podcast right now?
[98.12 → 99.10] We had considered it.
[99.38 → 99.90] Time out.
[99.90 → 101.58] Is that coffee, Casey?
[102.82 → 103.18] This?
[103.30 → 104.30] No, this is tea.
[104.48 → 104.54] Okay.
[104.74 → 105.02] Okay.
[105.04 → 106.72] I was about to say, I was like, that is mud water.
[106.82 → 107.90] You should not be drinking that.
[107.92 → 108.74] No, no, no, no.
[108.80 → 109.92] That's tea, my friend.
[110.54 → 112.62] It's actually like mango tea.
[112.94 → 113.26] Okay.
[113.40 → 113.66] Okay.
[113.66 → 114.48] I'll allow it then.
[114.56 → 114.82] All right.
[114.86 → 115.16] All right.
[115.62 → 116.22] You know what?
[116.24 → 118.54] You don't get to allow anything in Casey's life, Trash.
[118.86 → 119.30] It's true.
[119.30 → 119.54] Okay.
[119.54 → 120.14] He's an adult.
[120.14 → 121.42] He can make his own choices.
[121.54 → 122.08] Oh, that's tea?
[122.20 → 122.32] Okay.
[122.36 → 122.68] I'm sorry.
[122.86 → 122.98] Cool.
[123.14 → 123.44] Cool.
[123.66 → 123.74] Cool.
[123.82 → 124.72] Speak for yourself, Prime.
[124.84 → 128.62] I would appreciate some commentary on my beverage choices from Trash.
[128.68 → 129.58] I want to hear that.
[129.58 → 130.20] I want to know.
[130.32 → 134.76] Maybe I'm making some very, very serious mistakes when I fill up my cup in the morning.
[135.06 → 135.34] Okay.
[135.48 → 135.66] Fair.
[135.76 → 135.88] Could be.
[136.04 → 137.10] I mean, is it Terminal Coffee?
[138.42 → 139.64] So, here's the thing.
[139.96 → 141.78] You know, I'm a Windows user.
[141.88 → 143.26] How am I going to order Terminal Coffee?
[143.26 → 143.60] Buddy.
[143.66 → 143.88] Buddy.
[143.88 → 143.98] Buddy.
[144.08 → 144.76] S-H-H.
[145.04 → 146.10] I don't even know.
[146.10 → 146.48] Buddy, you idiot.
[147.70 → 151.48] Casey, we know that you have many Linux servers sitting around.
[151.68 → 152.54] Yeah, I didn't want to.
[152.54 → 154.74] You don't even need a GUI attached to them to order.
[155.26 → 155.54] Okay.
[155.80 → 156.22] All right.
[156.74 → 157.90] S-H-H.
[158.00 → 158.98] What do you guys use?
[158.98 → 159.82] I can't remember.
[160.08 → 161.60] I don't think I can use it.
[161.64 → 162.38] Is it secure?
[166.06 → 168.86] Many are still wondering that on Hacker News to this day.
[169.06 → 169.30] Yep.
[170.08 → 174.80] I actually do like the idea of being able to order things from a command prompt if you're
[174.80 → 176.00] already in a command prompt.
[176.20 → 177.60] Like, I love the idea.
[178.02 → 181.18] I'm kind of surprised, actually, that you haven't taken over the world already.
[181.28 → 184.86] I'm assuming that's because the only thing you could buy on there is just some coffee.
[184.86 → 190.62] You need, like, Amazon, but it's all accessible just from the terminal, right?
[190.68 → 192.40] I mean, I assume that's the eventual goal.
[193.56 → 194.88] I don't know if that's the goal.
[195.64 → 195.84] No?
[195.84 → 195.90] No.
[197.10 → 202.88] But I do like the idea of selling other items other than just coffee and even being able
[202.88 → 206.94] to sell stuff that, say, is, like, more drop-shipped or is able to be shipped from countries in
[206.94 → 211.10] which we currently do not sell in because it is very difficult to get coffee all around
[211.10 → 211.86] the world and all that.
[211.92 → 214.96] So we are only available technically in Europe and in the Americas.
[215.42 → 216.02] It's pretty good.
[216.10 → 217.02] Good sourced coffee.
[217.86 → 218.62] Thanks, Trash.
[218.86 → 219.38] Thanks, Trash.
[219.58 → 220.32] Trash approved.
[220.98 → 221.10] Okay.
[221.10 → 223.20] We're putting that on the bag, dude.
[223.36 → 223.70] Nice.
[223.92 → 228.70] That seems like a good segue into this stream, which is, like, gear talk.
[228.86 → 234.70] Are Trash and I the only two keyboard fiends on this particular podcast?
[235.10 → 236.76] Or are you guys keyboard fiends as well?
[236.76 → 239.46] I wouldn't say I'm a fiend, but I have a good number of them that I would share.
[239.68 → 243.22] So it's kind of interesting because I feel like me and Prime probably have the goofiest
[243.22 → 244.92] keyboards, but I only own one.
[245.20 → 245.56] Okay.
[245.78 → 245.96] Yeah.
[246.00 → 246.22] Right?
[246.22 → 250.90] So it's like, you know how when people are like, oh, there's only, like, left and right
[250.90 → 252.90] politically, and then someone's like, oh, you've got to get out the compass?
[253.10 → 254.98] I feel like this is us for keyboards right now.
[255.12 → 259.64] Like, we've got to get out the keyboard compass here of, like, are you an authoritarian keyboarder?
[260.48 → 260.80] Yeah.
[261.64 → 265.68] Yeah, there's definitely some sort of SWOT analysis diagram of keyboards about to happen
[265.68 → 266.06] right here.
[266.40 → 266.58] All right.
[266.60 → 272.14] So since I know very, very little about keyboards other than I type, and I'm very fast at them,
[272.14 → 276.56] you want to give us, like, a walkthrough, like, maybe, like, an intro into keyboards
[276.56 → 280.58] for all of us, and then kind of, Casey, maybe tell us why you choose yours, and what makes
[280.58 → 282.68] an excellent keyboard, and why is everybody else's opinion wrong?
[283.02 → 283.42] Oh, TJ.
[283.44 → 285.66] I also want to know how you got into keyboards, Casey.
[286.54 → 287.30] It might even be better.
[287.36 → 288.40] How did you get into keyboards?
[289.00 → 289.30] Okay.
[289.48 → 296.74] So this is, I have to say this very carefully in case you guys ever want sponsors that are
[296.74 → 299.36] involved in keyboard manufacturing on this program.
[299.36 → 306.86] So I'll simply say I used to use a particular brand of keyboard that I liked well enough,
[306.86 → 312.88] but I had to replace it, like, every year because, like, a key would eventually die.
[312.96 → 313.62] Microsoft keyboard.
[314.46 → 314.84] No.
[314.98 → 315.20] Okay.
[315.84 → 317.92] But that's probably true as well.
[318.14 → 318.98] It didn't happen to me.
[319.30 → 323.76] Developers, are you tired of code reviews that just say looks good to me or here's seven things
[323.76 → 326.10] I need you to change that are irrelevant to the PR?

[364.44 → 370.42] And so about two or three years ago, I can't remember exactly when, maybe two years ago,
[370.52 → 374.16] I was just like, all right, look, I'm just going to learn about keyboards.
[374.78 → 380.48] And I'm sure, I'm sure that I can go out there in this world of like, I know there's keyboard
[380.48 → 381.54] fanatics out there.
[381.54 → 386.78] There must be a keyboard that I can buy that I will like that will be like super durable.
[386.78 → 391.86] And I can just have that keyboard for like the next 10 years and not think about it anymore.
[391.86 → 392.34] Right.
[393.36 → 397.14] And so I, that's what started me down this road.
[397.14 → 401.14] And it went from that relatively simple proposition.
[401.14 → 403.64] And this is how they get you, right?
[403.76 → 406.58] It's like the schoolyard dealer or whatever it is.
[406.58 → 408.82] Like they get you with this one little thing you want.
[408.88 → 411.12] I just want a little bit nicer keyboard or something.
[411.54 → 418.92] And, you know, now today it's like, I make, I make these myself by buying various like mod
[418.92 → 421.82] kits and the base keyboard and different switches and keycaps.
[421.82 → 426.08] And I put them all together, and I didn't even notice that happening to me.
[426.32 → 428.20] Like I didn't notice this happening to me.
[428.28 → 429.46] I've gone all the way.
[429.56 → 432.00] So anyway, does that answer that question first?
[432.14 → 432.26] Yeah.
[432.82 → 438.28] You're telling me that a slightly, you, it's just a desire to have a product last longer
[438.28 → 441.92] than one year is how big industrial keyboard complex gets you.
[442.40 → 442.80] Yes.
[443.06 → 443.46] Yes.
[443.82 → 444.18] Yes.
[444.46 → 446.22] But it's actually small, small keyboard.
[446.22 → 446.62] I don't know.
[446.70 → 449.12] It's, it's like, it's like niche keyboard people get you.
[449.22 → 450.08] That's how they get you.
[451.08 → 453.78] You know, the it's like the Arch Linux experience or whatever.
[453.78 → 459.06] It's like some, it's like, it doesn't work on a lot of people, but when it works, that's
[459.06 → 459.26] it.
[459.40 → 460.72] You're, you're in, right?
[460.78 → 463.88] You are, you've gone down that road, and you're never coming back.
[464.10 → 468.94] The lifetime value on the people who buy one custom keyboard kit.
[469.08 → 469.80] Oh boy.
[469.88 → 471.20] You, you are happy.
[471.28 → 474.04] That's a that's a big capture for that LTV boys.
[475.16 → 475.56] Yep.
[476.22 → 477.52] So that's what happened.
[477.68 → 478.68] That's what happened to me.
[478.92 → 482.96] And so, uh, I happen to be using now, I use the Reckon.
[483.42 → 486.12] This is the, the, the base keyboard is a Reckon.
[486.24 → 487.06] They're super heavy.
[487.22 → 490.18] This thing I'm lifting now is probably like 10 pounds or something.
[490.28 → 491.00] What material is it?
[491.74 → 493.94] Uh, it's solid metal of some kind.
[494.22 → 494.96] It's nuts.
[495.06 → 495.78] I don't know.
[495.88 → 497.80] It's like spent uranium, right?
[497.84 → 499.62] It's ridiculous how heavy this thing is.
[499.64 → 500.62] I want a tungsten keyboard.
[500.62 → 502.26] Like I want a 50 pound keyboard.
[503.06 → 504.80] This is when you pick this up.
[504.80 → 506.70] That is what you will think you are holding.
[506.84 → 508.58] It is shockingly heavy.
[508.84 → 511.04] I've never held a keyboard that was this heavy before.
[511.42 → 512.24] Uh, but it's nice.
[512.32 → 513.20] It stays where you put it.
[513.26 → 514.26] And that's pretty great.
[514.70 → 517.02] Um, the only thing I will say, the Reckon.
[517.02 → 522.30] So this, the stock model Neurons, these guys here, uh, which these are custom keycaps.
[522.40 → 523.64] That's not what it would look like normally.
[524.02 → 529.34] Uh, the stock models, they, when you get a keyboard, there are a couple of different things
[529.34 → 532.24] that will determine like the feel and the sound and that sort of thing.
[532.88 → 539.28] Sound in particular, the body of the keyboard plays a big role in that, believe it or not.
[539.28 → 544.56] So the stock Neurons, they feel too crispy to me.
[544.66 → 547.84] They're very like, they have, what's a lot of, what does that mean?
[548.04 → 549.54] Like treble, a lot of treble.
[549.54 → 550.02] Like sun chips?
[550.50 → 550.84] Yes.
[550.86 → 551.30] Treble?
[551.44 → 553.50] Like the sun chip bag is what you're trying to say.
[554.56 → 558.18] Like metal, like the feeling of hitting metal a little bit too much.
[558.18 → 562.68] Like your, your feet, you're hearing that it's like a little bit ping, and you feel it.
[562.68 → 563.32] It's like a little spring sound.
[563.60 → 564.10] Like an ecto's almost.
[564.10 → 566.14] Maybe, not necessarily, not like the Switch.
[566.44 → 570.46] So not like, not like the old IBM keyboard, those like clang, clang, clang, clang ones
[570.46 → 571.16] or anything like that.
[571.58 → 574.04] But you just, it's a little, crispy is the best way.
[574.44 → 576.28] I can't, we're clipping that, dude.
[576.50 → 576.66] Crispy prime.
[576.90 → 577.18] It's crispy, okay?
[577.18 → 579.40] That's the new intro to the standup.
[579.70 → 580.96] Clang, clang, clang, clang.
[582.18 → 584.28] It's just a little bit crispy is all I'm saying.
[584.78 → 584.92] All right.
[584.92 → 592.54] So what you do is you, you open them up, and you mod them by putting in like very, like
[592.54 → 594.36] boron foam and a PEB.
[595.00 → 600.68] There's all these like inserts you use because if you open these up stock, there's very little
[600.68 → 601.98] actual padding in them.
[602.14 → 605.32] And so I add a bunch of padding to them, which you can buy after market.
[605.42 → 606.68] You can buy after market ones for this.
[606.74 → 607.70] You don't even have to cut it yourself.
[607.84 → 608.40] You just buy them.
[608.40 → 609.10] Like pillows or keys?
[609.34 → 611.66] Does that make what the kids call phoniness?
[612.46 → 614.86] That's what make your keyboard got honk, think, think.
[614.86 → 617.32] Think is usually like a brown switch.
[617.32 → 618.74] I see what you're asking for.
[619.52 → 621.82] It's really not quite that.
[622.18 → 626.18] That's more just like, I think you're talking about took, T-H-O-K.
[626.46 → 626.76] Yes.
[626.86 → 627.08] Yes.
[627.08 → 627.32] You're right.
[627.32 → 627.76] Hokiness.
[627.96 → 628.10] Took.
[628.30 → 628.70] They.
[628.82 → 629.08] Thick.
[629.52 → 630.34] Do you have thick keys?
[633.00 → 633.44] Sorry.
[633.98 → 634.32] I had to.
[635.80 → 636.60] Not think.
[636.64 → 637.34] I put an N in there.
[637.42 → 637.58] Okay.
[637.62 → 638.18] I sound like an idiot.
[638.30 → 638.40] Yeah.
[638.46 → 638.78] Took.
[639.44 → 639.80] Took.
[639.96 → 640.36] They.
[640.96 → 643.96] Took is the overall quality of a sound you're looking for.
[644.28 → 647.10] They use that to describe that like, took, took, took, took, took, took, took, took,
[647.10 → 647.36] took, took, took, took, took, took, took, took, took, took, took, took, took, took, took,
[647.36 → 648.14] kind of noise.
[648.24 → 649.88] I don't, I can't make it with my mouth.
[650.10 → 650.40] Here, I think I got it.
[650.40 → 651.60] Here are some pinks.
[651.60 → 652.40] Here, hold on one second.
[652.48 → 653.02] Let me get this.
[655.82 → 656.26] Okay.
[656.60 → 657.20] Kind of took.
[657.40 → 657.68] Okay.
[657.88 → 658.56] Is that took?
[659.26 → 664.60] I mean, here's the thing I will say, despite being very into building my own keyboards,
[665.02 → 668.28] I never really know exactly what people are talking about with took.
[668.34 → 670.84] You go online, and you hear lots of like keyboard demo.
[670.98 → 672.66] They all sound pretty similar.
[672.66 → 675.36] And a lot of them that I would have thought are they.
[675.44 → 679.32] They're like, that's not they or this is, you know, so I'm not going to say I can't comment.
[679.48 → 680.46] I'm not an expert.
[680.76 → 684.82] I feel like this is, this is the meme with the butterfly where the guy, you know, he's looking
[684.82 → 686.80] up and prime is just holding up keyboards.
[686.98 → 687.86] Is this took?
[688.56 → 688.98] I know.
[689.02 → 690.10] Someone said that's not took.
[690.16 → 690.94] That was creamy.
[691.40 → 693.36] I didn't even realize there was a creamy category.
[693.52 → 693.62] Okay.
[693.66 → 694.50] Is this one took?
[694.60 → 695.10] Just quick question.
[695.12 → 695.94] People are just making things up.
[696.02 → 696.94] Everyone's just making things up.
[699.46 → 700.24] That's more cliquey.
[700.54 → 701.56] I love that sound.
[701.56 → 705.00] My eyes almost like rolled to the back of my head.
[705.56 → 706.28] Hold up.
[706.28 → 706.62] Hold up.
[706.92 → 707.18] Hold up.
[707.22 → 708.08] There's that sound.
[708.54 → 713.62] First, Trash, you're asking if the keyboard's thick, and now you're saying you love that.
[714.02 → 714.46] Trash?
[714.98 → 715.42] Trash?
[715.64 → 716.88] I'm a big ASMR guy.
[717.08 → 718.04] That's all I'm going to say.
[718.04 → 719.44] You should not say that.
[719.50 → 719.74] Okay.
[719.80 → 724.10] I don't know if you've been on the internet, but ASMR is not keyboard clicking sounds.
[724.10 → 724.48] ASMR is cool.
[724.72 → 725.12] So yeah.
[725.60 → 727.68] I mean, I love these things.
[727.90 → 731.62] I will enrage everyone in chat now.
[731.66 → 731.82] Yeah.
[731.82 → 739.60] By revealing that not only do I not want hokiness or cliquey keys or any of those things.
[740.08 → 742.64] I like it to be squishy.
[743.40 → 744.10] Sorry, Trash.
[744.70 → 745.78] So like a membrane?
[746.66 → 749.06] Oh, that's why you put the little sponges underneath your keys?
[749.86 → 750.50] Oh, dude.
[750.50 → 751.68] I hate that.
[751.68 → 752.00] Okay.
[752.12 → 753.00] It's like you're typing.
[753.08 → 758.42] It's like those keyboards that have like those, um, like that silicone thing underneath them.
[758.62 → 758.82] Yeah.
[758.90 → 759.68] Like those stock keyboards.
[759.90 → 760.14] Yeah.
[760.56 → 763.58] It feels like you're like typing on a keyboard that has like saran wrap inside of it.
[763.58 → 770.00] Well, no, that, that, that I would hate too, but I want that, that smooth, like, like I'm
[770.00 → 772.74] just flying through the night on an owl's wings.
[772.98 → 774.44] I want that feeling.
[774.44 → 774.78] Right.
[774.78 → 775.74] So you're just like typing in a keyboard.
[775.74 → 775.98] Relatable.
[777.86 → 778.30] Right.
[778.72 → 779.64] What are you doing?
[779.90 → 780.04] Yeah.
[780.10 → 782.08] It comes from the I held this up before.
[782.16 → 784.24] It comes from this, this problem.
[784.24 → 791.68] When I was little, I had Amiga computers and I just, it's like chasing that first, you
[791.68 → 795.02] know, it's that first experience you're trying to get back the whole time.
[795.12 → 799.00] And those were very, they had the really nice soft squish to them.
[799.28 → 801.48] And so I always wanted that back.
[801.52 → 803.22] And this is the first time I've ever been able to get it.
[803.22 → 806.50] So these, so I'm actually using silent switches in this.
[806.58 → 811.58] That's, that's a type of category of switch as opposed to the kinds what, what no one wants
[811.58 → 814.02] those except me apparently, but I love it.
[814.24 → 814.50] So.
[815.64 → 816.04] Okay.
[816.34 → 818.78] So where, so, so just help me for a quick second.
[818.78 → 821.00] I know, I know chat won't be able to see this as well.
[821.52 → 827.34] Um, but on the matrix of shock and squish, are you telling me there's also, what's the
[827.34 → 827.82] other one?
[828.40 → 830.72] There's creamy as one.
[831.38 → 832.40] What about cliquey?
[832.48 → 833.92] There's like a cliquey as well.
[834.06 → 834.70] And then cliquey.
[835.30 → 835.70] Yeah.
[835.78 → 836.82] I mean, I can hold it.
[836.96 → 840.80] This is not how charts work from, but this is one of those things.
[840.94 → 842.04] It's like, where are you?
[842.06 → 843.46] Are you part of, are you right?
[843.50 → 844.22] Are you right here?
[844.28 → 845.70] Are you more on the squishy side?
[846.14 → 846.30] Yeah.
[846.30 → 849.54] But the, the, the categories have to go on the lines.
[849.54 → 850.94] I didn't want to write over the line.
[850.94 → 852.70] And then I realized I totally did this incorrect.
[852.88 → 853.04] Okay.
[853.10 → 853.40] My bad.
[853.40 → 854.04] My bad.
[854.04 → 854.08] My bad.
[854.08 → 854.72] My bad.
[854.72 → 855.08] My bad.
[855.08 → 855.32] Yeah.
[855.42 → 855.74] Okay.
[855.74 → 857.00] So it'd be squishy up here.
[857.08 → 857.30] Sorry.
[857.40 → 857.66] Okay.
[857.66 → 858.18] There we go.
[858.28 → 858.64] Okay.
[858.68 → 858.98] All right.
[859.02 → 859.54] Thank you.
[859.86 → 860.16] Okay.
[860.32 → 860.64] Okay.
[860.64 → 863.08] I'm going to go back and shame to this.
[863.68 → 863.80] Yeah.
[863.88 → 869.02] I'm doing a proper standup and not paying attention.
[869.18 → 869.24] Okay.
[869.24 → 870.60] Josh, cut that out in post.
[870.72 → 872.08] Josh, save, just save prime.
[872.08 → 876.04] I mean, you get, look, we can, we can do this here.
[876.04 → 879.84] So this, I don't know if anyone can see, you probably can't even focus on this.
[879.96 → 880.96] It is completely blurry.
[881.16 → 882.00] There we go.
[882.12 → 882.54] What is that?
[883.30 → 884.02] So I'll just show you.
[884.06 → 885.60] This is a standard blue switch.
[885.70 → 891.34] This is, I think, a, a, a, a, a, a, a blue switch, which is, it's, it's not a cherry MX
[891.34 → 894.58] blue, which is probably the more standard kind, but it's, you know, a similar kind.
[895.08 → 898.42] This is a Kale box Jade.
[898.58 → 901.12] I thought they were called Kales for a long time.
[901.46 → 903.02] I thought they were called Kales for a long time.
[903.02 → 903.80] You're probably right.
[903.96 → 905.32] I have no idea how to pronounce it.
[905.32 → 905.76] They're Kale.
[905.88 → 906.18] You're right.
[906.26 → 907.02] They're actually called Kale.
[907.46 → 907.78] Okay.
[909.46 → 910.86] This is even cliquier.
[910.98 → 912.32] So if we do it, so here's the blue.
[912.44 → 913.06] I'll hold it up.
[913.98 → 914.42] You hear that?
[915.46 → 916.36] I love it.
[916.66 → 916.90] Yeah.
[917.18 → 918.14] I'm on Trash's team.
[918.22 → 918.84] That is the best.
[919.28 → 920.74] This is about to get age restricted.
[920.98 → 921.14] Right.
[921.16 → 921.70] Yeah, I know this.
[921.80 → 924.30] We're going to get, we're going to get demonetized.
[924.30 → 929.28] Unfortunately, but here a Kale box Jade is way harder core cliquey.
[929.38 → 930.78] So if you're cliquey, you want this.
[932.52 → 933.16] Oh yeah.
[933.16 → 933.58] You hear that?
[934.14 → 934.34] Yeah.
[934.86 → 936.02] I need a harder click though.
[936.16 → 937.70] And that's a good way to make your coworkers hate you.
[937.70 → 938.94] No, this is way harder.
[939.06 → 940.06] You put a Kale box Jade in there.
[940.12 → 941.52] It's way harder to push.
[941.76 → 942.30] It is stiff.
[943.06 → 945.28] Like these things are, you want, you want thick.
[945.44 → 946.16] This is stiff.
[947.34 → 949.76] And these, these are also box switches.
[949.76 → 954.72] So box switches are ones that have a box around where the, the key cap inserts.
[954.86 → 955.76] So they don't wobble.
[955.88 → 957.26] You know, normally you put your finger on a key.
[957.36 → 958.42] You can kind of move it a little bit.
[958.42 → 960.12] It has a little bit of play.
[960.62 → 961.34] Well, it's okay.
[961.40 → 962.56] We can see if we can see this in here.
[962.62 → 964.50] There's a box right in there.
[964.64 → 965.86] Like that holds it.
[966.02 → 967.06] Do you see how there's a square?
[967.06 → 967.66] That's what it means.
[967.98 → 968.24] See?
[968.36 → 969.14] Oh my gosh.
[969.14 → 970.50] That's what a box means.
[970.54 → 972.40] As opposed to normal, the normal switch.
[972.40 → 973.42] Because I never heard of it why it's a box Jade.
[973.50 → 974.66] Like why is it a box Jade?
[974.70 → 975.32] I didn't know that.
[975.44 → 979.16] The normal switch is just the little nub, right?
[979.46 → 980.10] So there you go.
[981.00 → 981.68] So anyway.
[981.68 → 982.22] Oh, trash.
[982.32 → 982.62] Nice.
[984.10 → 985.08] That's how that goes.
[985.36 → 990.72] But anyway, that's, that's what determines more of the clickiness, stockiness thing.
[990.80 → 993.28] The switches and the key caps are going to be more of that.
[993.38 → 996.78] The, the body is more, I mean, you know, think of it like a fine guitar.
[996.78 → 1000.68] That's where the resonance comes from, where the, where the other tones come from.
[1000.78 → 1001.22] Right.
[1001.60 → 1004.94] But the but it starts with the switch and the, the key cap, obviously.
[1006.40 → 1006.84] Okay.
[1007.58 → 1009.26] What is the switch and the key cap?
[1009.38 → 1011.66] What is, what is that in relation to the guitar?
[1013.00 → 1017.76] The strings and the bridge?
[1018.36 → 1018.76] Fretboard?
[1020.02 → 1020.42] Fretboard.
[1020.58 → 1021.16] I don't know.
[1021.62 → 1022.26] Pickup and strings.
[1022.38 → 1022.54] Okay.
[1022.60 → 1023.12] Pickup and strings.
[1023.24 → 1023.40] Okay.
[1023.44 → 1023.64] Okay.
[1023.64 → 1023.82] Okay.
[1023.82 → 1025.30] I want to show you my keyboard, Casey.
[1025.66 → 1025.88] Yeah.
[1025.88 → 1026.78] Let's do some trash.
[1026.78 → 1027.98] I think you'll appreciate it.
[1028.02 → 1030.54] Trash and put, click it next to the microphone, dude.
[1030.56 → 1031.30] We need to hear it.
[1031.30 → 1031.84] You can hear this.
[1032.24 → 1033.86] Oh, look at that bad boy.
[1035.22 → 1035.92] Can you hear that?
[1036.18 → 1036.84] Yes, I can.
[1036.84 → 1037.12] Oh yeah.
[1037.56 → 1039.64] So these are the brown tactile keys.
[1039.94 → 1043.30] So I got into keyboards not too long ago.
[1043.36 → 1045.54] I went to a startup and everyone was like half my age.
[1045.54 → 1048.92] And like, I was like the kind of person that just used the default keyboard, whatever was
[1048.92 → 1051.40] on my desk that my work gave me, I would just use happily.
[1051.90 → 1056.10] But then all these like boomers were just looked so cool with like their keyboards.
[1056.10 → 1059.36] And they're like, literally everyone was on my team, and I was just like looking around.
[1059.50 → 1061.32] Peer pressure by 19-year-olds.
[1061.84 → 1064.86] It was like the meme where the guy with the back right side, he's like, hello, hello,
[1064.98 → 1065.48] fellow kids.
[1065.60 → 1067.20] That was like literally me.
[1067.60 → 1072.98] So everyone was like having their cliquey clacks and like, I just came in, and I was
[1072.98 → 1075.04] like, dude, like I felt so out of place.
[1075.12 → 1077.46] So when you pulled out your keyboard, were you like kind of ashamed?
[1077.56 → 1079.44] You're like, I just borrowed this one.
[1079.50 → 1080.44] My keyboard's at home.
[1080.58 → 1080.98] My other ones in the shop.
[1080.98 → 1081.74] I have another keyboard.
[1082.56 → 1083.30] This is what happened.
[1083.40 → 1087.66] I literally like first day, first week, I get to my desk, plug my laptop in, got a new
[1087.66 → 1088.10] laptop.
[1088.54 → 1092.46] They already have like a keyboard at my desk for me, which is like the default Mac one, which
[1092.46 → 1093.80] is like super skinny and flat.
[1094.02 → 1096.48] And I just start typing on it, and they're all just like looking at me.
[1096.48 → 1099.24] And they're like, is he not going to, is he not going to switch that out?
[1099.46 → 1100.24] And I'm like, what do you mean?
[1100.60 → 1101.20] What do you mean?
[1101.24 → 1102.48] And then like, it was funny.
[1102.54 → 1104.48] They had a they had typing competitions.
[1104.92 → 1108.54] You could type the fastest, but at the same time they all had like blue keys.
[1108.60 → 1109.42] It was like cliquey clack.
[1109.66 → 1111.16] But anyway, it looked so cool.
[1111.20 → 1113.16] And they all had like crazy colour schemes.
[1113.34 → 1116.06] And I was like, man, I got like really sad.
[1116.06 → 1119.60] And I was like, I went online and just like bought like three, and I was like,
[1119.84 → 1122.66] question, question, question.
[1122.66 → 1127.78] When you came into the office with yours, A, did you hope that people were going to be
[1127.78 → 1129.18] like, whoa, trash?
[1129.30 → 1130.56] And B, were you a poser?
[1131.14 → 1132.92] You know, like you're the guy that shows up.
[1132.92 → 1133.24] Oh, 100% a poser.
[1134.54 → 1135.88] How long ago was this?
[1138.64 → 1140.94] Just carrying the old keyboard.
[1141.72 → 1144.12] How's that good juror task going?
[1145.50 → 1146.20] Oh, okay.
[1146.70 → 1148.84] I'm just here with my new keyboard.
[1148.84 → 1151.46] If you need it, I'll be over here on my keyboard.
[1152.26 → 1152.70] See you all.
[1153.66 → 1155.02] Oh, wait, can you lift that back up?
[1155.06 → 1155.82] Can you lift it back up?
[1156.40 → 1160.20] Do you have the HJK and L coloured black on there?
[1162.14 → 1163.00] It's pretty nice.
[1163.00 → 1163.32] Nice trash.
[1163.78 → 1164.12] I do.
[1164.56 → 1166.26] Oh, and you've got a custom F12.
[1166.94 → 1168.26] Custom escape in F12.
[1168.44 → 1168.58] Okay.
[1168.68 → 1169.52] So I have, dude.
[1169.60 → 1169.80] Yeah.
[1169.82 → 1171.24] I'm like, I like geeked out real hard.
[1171.58 → 1171.82] Oh yeah.
[1171.82 → 1172.32] So I have like these two.
[1172.32 → 1173.22] Okay, trash, but stop.
[1173.28 → 1177.38] Before you go further, is this the very first one or is this like several iterations later?
[1177.38 → 1179.88] No, these are, this is actually the first one I ever got.
[1180.56 → 1180.76] Okay.
[1180.84 → 1181.90] So I have two versions of it.
[1181.92 → 1185.32] I don't want to unplug this other keyboard, but I got this one, and then I switched out
[1185.32 → 1186.04] keys with another one.
[1186.08 → 1187.18] So I have a bunch of hentai keys.
[1187.82 → 1189.68] He actually sent me a bag of hentai keys.
[1189.88 → 1190.28] Awesome.
[1191.56 → 1192.26] I sent some hentai keys.
[1192.54 → 1193.62] So I brought this into the office.
[1193.74 → 1194.58] Didn't get in trouble, luckily.
[1195.12 → 1196.26] My wife threw them away.
[1196.84 → 1197.54] Just FYI.
[1197.72 → 1198.60] They never made it.
[1200.60 → 1201.66] Now we're definitely going to be monetized.
[1201.66 → 1204.18] It did not happen on my keyboard.
[1204.18 → 1207.32] But yeah, dude, I went all out, just like, like colour schemes.
[1207.48 → 1210.36] But then I got these, uh, Trash, has your wife seen your keyboard?
[1211.72 → 1214.48] Which she's been describing as thick and amazing.
[1214.98 → 1216.60] She's embarrassed whenever she sees it.
[1216.64 → 1218.02] She's like, I can't believe I'm married to you.
[1219.02 → 1220.70] And I'm like, I can't believe it either.
[1222.12 → 1223.64] And I'm like, I agree with you.
[1223.90 → 1224.74] I'm like, fair.
[1224.92 → 1226.02] I feel the same way.
[1226.30 → 1228.62] But then I got these cool, like, Naruto custom keys.
[1228.70 → 1230.80] So there's like a Ninetales and Susan.
[1231.46 → 1232.18] They're like acrylic.
[1232.18 → 1232.94] Quick side though.
[1232.94 → 1236.68] Prime didn't even know about the Rock Lee scene where he drops his weights.
[1237.68 → 1239.08] Ah, that is better.
[1239.42 → 1240.92] Now I will be able to move freely.
[1241.70 → 1242.36] Come on.
[1242.40 → 1247.42] You really think you'll be able to get through GAAR's defences just by dropping a couple of pounds of weight?
[1249.78 → 1250.40] Yeah, yeah.
[1250.56 → 1251.22] What about that scene?
[1251.58 → 1253.00] He didn't even know it existed.
[1253.16 → 1254.12] I was trying to reference it.
[1254.26 → 1256.24] That's like the hardest scene in all anime culture, bro.
[1256.34 → 1257.12] That's what I'm saying.
[1257.60 → 1259.24] I was embarrassed to be known by him.
[1260.04 → 1261.18] That's the hardest scene?
[1261.18 → 1263.08] Dude, it's so hard.
[1263.58 → 1264.28] Crazy hard.
[1264.48 → 1264.76] Okay.
[1265.48 → 1265.98] It's sick.
[1266.06 → 1270.34] I guess I will never like anime if that's the case.
[1270.90 → 1273.62] Is it bad time to mention that I have no idea what you're talking about at all?
[1273.72 → 1274.44] That's okay, Casey.
[1274.64 → 1275.06] It's okay.
[1275.06 → 1275.44] You're all right.
[1275.54 → 1276.04] You're safe.
[1276.26 → 1276.46] All right.
[1276.50 → 1276.72] You're safe.
[1277.10 → 1277.26] Good.
[1277.36 → 1277.54] Yep.
[1277.64 → 1278.16] Good to know.
[1278.16 → 1281.74] But yeah, my story into keyboards isn't really anything complicated.
[1281.88 → 1282.90] I just want it to look cool.
[1283.08 → 1286.62] And then once I bought the first one, and I saw Milky have this keyboard on stream.
[1286.70 → 1287.72] It's the GMMK Pro.
[1288.12 → 1290.00] And I was like, dude, this is clean because it lights up.
[1290.32 → 1292.60] Like you can change the LED backlights.
[1293.06 → 1295.88] But this thing weighs like 10 plus pounds.
[1295.88 → 1296.88] I took it to work in my book bag.
[1296.88 → 1301.94] So not only did you copy it because of Boomers, you went straight RGB right afterwards, too.
[1302.90 → 1303.44] Dude, man.
[1303.54 → 1304.72] I lost control.
[1304.84 → 1305.12] And then look.
[1305.34 → 1306.78] And then I lost control.
[1306.78 → 1306.98] And then.
[1306.98 → 1313.94] And then I was like, okay, maybe my wrist does hurt a little bit.
[1314.52 → 1318.72] And you know, I was like, I don't know if it's like placebo from like seeing you all.
[1318.90 → 1319.72] Like, oh, my wrist hurt.
[1319.78 → 1321.66] And I was like, man, I think maybe my wrist hurt.
[1321.92 → 1322.04] Yeah.
[1322.18 → 1324.00] So I was like, all right, fine.
[1324.08 → 1325.24] Let me try this shit.
[1325.36 → 1325.98] And then I got this.
[1325.98 → 1326.72] If you got this Ergo Docs.
[1327.16 → 1329.78] I got the Voyager as my first split key.
[1329.94 → 1331.56] This thing was way too hard.
[1331.86 → 1332.78] Used it for one week.
[1332.78 → 1337.24] And it's just if anyone wants to buy this from me, I will sell it to you.
[1338.16 → 1339.22] What was that?
[1339.50 → 1340.64] Dude, it's called the Voyager.
[1340.82 → 1342.54] And there's like zero keys on it.
[1342.78 → 1344.24] I was so confused.
[1344.56 → 1344.66] Yeah.
[1344.74 → 1345.68] Where's the shift key?
[1345.82 → 1346.70] Don't get a Voyager.
[1346.84 → 1347.12] What is this?
[1347.18 → 1347.50] Look at that.
[1350.42 → 1351.98] What is this?
[1352.80 → 1353.64] Oh, my dude.
[1353.76 → 1354.60] Well, you bought it.
[1354.78 → 1354.96] All right.
[1354.96 → 1355.34] How much?
[1355.38 → 1356.38] How much are you selling it for?
[1356.44 → 1356.66] How much?
[1356.70 → 1358.86] We got a lot of people in chat right now saying they'd buy it.
[1358.90 → 1359.58] What is the cost?
[1359.58 → 1362.22] I'll sell it 10% below market price.
[1362.22 → 1362.96] Whatever that is.
[1363.02 → 1363.24] Trash.
[1363.46 → 1364.96] Dude, you're doing this wrong.
[1365.08 → 1367.78] You can sell it above market price and sign it.
[1367.86 → 1369.18] Because you're a stand-up member.
[1369.32 → 1372.38] 50% and I'll spit on it or something.
[1374.34 → 1375.98] Throw in a key with that.
[1376.38 → 1377.76] Throw in a key with that.
[1377.76 → 1378.96] And you'll sign it.
[1378.96 → 1379.10] You know what?
[1379.16 → 1383.78] I'll include some bath water in the box.
[1384.88 → 1385.34] All right.
[1385.72 → 1386.20] We got something.
[1386.34 → 1389.32] We should probably start, honestly, Trash, with what you're offering at this point.
[1389.42 → 1391.54] Since it's such a comprehensive package for Trash.
[1391.54 → 1391.82] Trash.
[1391.82 → 1392.14] Yes.
[1392.14 → 1393.96] We should probably get an auction site going.
[1394.64 → 1394.86] Yes.
[1394.96 → 1396.78] We should auction it through SSH.
[1396.92 → 1401.14] We'll add a special spot in Terminal.shop, and we'll auction it off.
[1401.48 → 1401.76] Trash.
[1401.84 → 1402.16] Trash.
[1402.28 → 1403.28] Only Trash.com.
[1403.68 → 1405.10] Only Trash.com.
[1406.78 → 1409.52] Dude, I legit tried the split keyboard experience.
[1409.66 → 1414.08] I think all my friends that do use split keyboards, they're like, you went to hard mode.
[1414.64 → 1415.50] Because there's just way fewer keys.
[1415.50 → 1416.74] Yeah, that is a hard one.
[1416.74 → 1417.96] That's a super hard one.
[1417.98 → 1419.74] So I was like, okay, first this was a mistake.
[1419.86 → 1421.90] So maybe I might try it again with like a moon lander or something.
[1421.96 → 1422.34] I don't know.
[1422.60 → 1424.56] Why not just go for Kinesis?
[1424.92 → 1429.14] Man, I tried your keyboard at the tower, and it was the hardest thing I've ever done.
[1429.34 → 1432.92] Prime's keyboard has software remaps so that all the letters lie to you.
[1433.00 → 1435.68] You cannot base the experience of split keyboards on Prime's keyboard.
[1435.68 → 1438.58] It literally had no keys on it so you couldn't see it.
[1438.78 → 1440.04] And it was remapped.
[1440.14 → 1442.64] So it was like not even possible for your brain to understand it.
[1443.20 → 1444.72] How do you learn that keyboard?
[1444.72 → 1445.34] You don't have labels on your keys.
[1445.56 → 1446.12] They're just blank keys.
[1446.12 → 1446.84] How did I learn a key?
[1446.90 → 1448.18] Dude, how do you learn your keyboard?
[1448.94 → 1450.40] No, but without labels on it.
[1450.46 → 1451.58] You just guessed where they were?
[1451.68 → 1451.94] No.
[1452.46 → 1453.26] Brother, brother.
[1453.96 → 1456.38] This is like iteration three of my keyboard.
[1456.84 → 1458.18] Okay, so it's the same one.
[1458.30 → 1459.68] Yeah, it just has nothing on it.
[1459.80 → 1460.36] That's all it is.
[1460.66 → 1461.70] It's just a blank space.
[1461.80 → 1463.10] Oh, look, TJ's flexing his.
[1463.68 → 1464.64] Oh, wow, okay.
[1464.64 → 1466.40] Didn't you bring an even smaller one to the tower?
[1466.52 → 1467.24] Or is that the one from the tower?
[1467.24 → 1468.30] No, I brought this one.
[1468.50 → 1468.92] I brought this one.
[1468.94 → 1469.74] Can you hold it like a gun?
[1469.74 → 1470.88] I put my hands on it, and I was like, I don't know.
[1470.90 → 1472.54] Can you hold it like a gun like a trash did?
[1473.50 → 1474.12] Pew, pew, pew.
[1474.20 → 1474.86] I'll do it like trash.
[1476.06 → 1477.56] It's like the Nintendo glove.
[1477.70 → 1478.24] What's the Nintendo?
[1478.32 → 1478.82] Power glove.
[1479.04 → 1479.66] The power glove.
[1479.66 → 1480.20] That's awesome.
[1480.20 → 1481.26] They remind me of.
[1484.82 → 1486.54] Well, you learn what's on here.
[1486.60 → 1488.08] You can program onto it, Casey.
[1488.30 → 1489.16] You'd like that.
[1490.20 → 1491.66] It's in C, so it's fast.
[1491.74 → 1493.02] You would like it, Mr. Parker.
[1493.02 → 1493.30] I have a question.
[1493.66 → 1494.30] Wait, hold on.
[1494.30 → 1495.62] I put laggy keyboard.
[1496.12 → 1497.76] This is the set that I have.
[1497.90 → 1498.16] Okay.
[1498.50 → 1500.98] So I swapped the keys from these two keyboards for the HJK.
[1501.24 → 1501.44] Ah.
[1502.14 → 1504.66] So this is blue keys and this is brown ones.
[1505.66 → 1506.06] Nice.
[1506.06 → 1510.34] I went, unsurprisingly, keycap-wise, as you can see.
[1510.34 → 1513.86] So if we take the original Amiga keyboard, right?
[1513.94 → 1515.56] That is what the keys looked like.
[1515.68 → 1519.22] So I was like, I want them to look exactly like that.
[1519.30 → 1520.54] And so that is what I did.
[1520.70 → 1522.74] Same exact colour scheme, classic style.
[1523.04 → 1526.80] I was actually going to ask you, why did you go like you were born in the 1970s?
[1527.16 → 1528.62] Because I was.
[1528.62 → 1529.30] Okay, okay.
[1529.44 → 1530.66] That is one reason.
[1530.66 → 1530.94] That is one reason.
[1531.14 → 1531.24] Okay.
[1531.66 → 1532.68] This is fantastic.
[1533.52 → 1538.22] This is why I didn't, I was not expecting Casey to know the Rock Lee Naruto scene.
[1538.32 → 1538.44] Okay.
[1538.48 → 1539.60] This is why he gets the exception.
[1539.62 → 1540.54] Yeah, I get a free pass.
[1540.74 → 1542.00] Yeah, he gets a free pass on that one.
[1542.12 → 1543.12] I get a geezer pass.
[1543.30 → 1544.70] I'm a decade older than you, TJ.
[1544.70 → 1544.82] Okay.
[1545.56 → 1548.68] My other one does have a little bit of flair.
[1549.14 → 1551.82] This is a keycap set that was a gift to me.
[1552.10 → 1553.84] So, but I like this one a lot, too.
[1553.94 → 1554.58] This is my best person.
[1554.60 → 1554.62] I like that.
[1554.70 → 1555.82] I like just clean, simple.
[1555.82 → 1557.66] Just a little bit of pizzazz, a little bit of flair.
[1557.84 → 1558.14] Okay.
[1558.62 → 1560.26] How much flair is too much flair?
[1561.34 → 1562.96] You know, it depends on what I'm doing.
[1563.10 → 1563.42] Hentai.
[1564.24 → 1565.04] That's the answer.
[1565.04 → 1567.94] I think I draw the line at hentai.
[1568.32 → 1572.30] Like, if your OK is literally an O phase, probably too much.
[1572.30 → 1574.30] I don't know if that's where the line starts.
[1574.70 → 1576.92] But I know it's past the line.
[1577.06 → 1579.68] Like, the line is somewhere before that, but that one.
[1580.70 → 1581.66] Dude, my OK.
[1581.90 → 1582.78] Look at my OK.
[1582.92 → 1583.12] Hold on.
[1583.14 → 1584.56] I don't know if you can see it, but you can see it.
[1584.56 → 1584.82] Oh, wow.
[1585.18 → 1586.06] I think it is too.
[1587.10 → 1588.64] It's idiot, dude.
[1588.78 → 1589.58] Oh, my.
[1590.62 → 1591.02] Incredible.
[1591.14 → 1592.44] I'm just like, so I'm in a Vim.
[1592.50 → 1594.30] I'm like, control O, O, O, O.
[1597.00 → 1598.96] Is this why you had to stop streaming, Trash?
[1599.62 → 1602.06] Yeah, my stream was, like, terrible at one point.
[1602.62 → 1603.78] I don't know how I was a band, but.
[1603.78 → 1604.10] Yeah.
[1604.50 → 1604.90] Wow.
[1605.94 → 1607.14] Oh, this is beautiful.
[1608.20 → 1611.40] My keyboard setup is puritanical compared to this.
[1611.56 → 1611.88] Wow.
[1612.88 → 1613.20] Okay.
[1613.56 → 1613.82] Yeah.
[1614.00 → 1614.66] Okay, so hold on.
[1614.72 → 1617.94] So, Casey, are you telling me you're not into the keyboard programming side of things?
[1618.28 → 1620.74] Like, are you a ZMK or QMK kind of kid?
[1620.80 → 1621.20] What are you?
[1621.20 → 1624.22] I do not program a keyboard at all.
[1624.64 → 1630.48] I used to swap control and caps lock, or not even swap them, but just make caps lock be control.
[1630.48 → 1634.86] Back when I was an Emacs user, because holy cow, right?
[1635.00 → 1635.30] Fair.
[1635.30 → 1638.34] You were holding that thing down 99.9% of the time.
[1638.54 → 1638.70] Yeah.
[1638.80 → 1644.00] But now that I go modal, I don't even bother with that, because I don't need to hold down control at all.
[1644.00 → 1645.08] So, yeah.
[1645.14 → 1652.20] So, you would have actually benefited from a thumb cluster, learning to press control with your thumb, and then it wouldn't have been nearly as, like, off to the side the whole time.
[1652.20 → 1663.74] So, when I used Emacs, I actually briefly did try an ergonomic keyboard, and I never really quite, I don't know, I couldn't quite get in the groove that way.
[1664.08 → 1666.82] It was maybe like Trash's experience.
[1667.18 → 1669.52] I think I maybe went a little too ergonomic.
[1669.62 → 1671.44] Like, I probably should have started with something simpler.
[1671.96 → 1675.44] There weren't a lot of options at the time due to the whole born in the 1970s thing.
[1676.04 → 1677.54] Nowadays, there's probably better options.
[1677.54 → 1679.58] So, they don't make keyboards for people who made it in the 1970s?
[1679.58 → 1680.18] They actually do.
[1680.26 → 1681.52] They didn't make them back then.
[1681.52 → 1684.08] He was saying what he was trying earlier, when I was trying.
[1684.52 → 1686.20] Nowadays, I could get one, right?
[1686.56 → 1688.18] Have you seen the movie Blubber?
[1689.18 → 1690.58] No, I've never heard of the movie Blubber.
[1691.06 → 1691.98] That's Robin Williams, right?
[1691.98 → 1692.88] Yeah, yeah, Robin Williams.
[1693.06 → 1695.44] Okay, so you do at least know about Robin Williams.
[1695.56 → 1699.06] So, if you would actually look in the Robin Williams photo, let me just bring it up for you right here.
[1699.40 → 1704.00] You'll notice right here in the Robin Williams photo, he's using a Kinesis Advantage 1.
[1704.70 → 1704.94] Oh.
[1705.56 → 1706.54] Yeah, Chad can't see it.
[1706.54 → 1707.46] From what year is this?
[1707.64 → 1708.42] From what year is that?
[1709.12 → 1709.56] 1997.
[1710.26 → 1710.88] This is 1997.
[1711.52 → 1712.28] Okay.
[1712.28 → 1716.66] And then if you do Men in Black, I'm very dangerous here, but here we go.
[1716.72 → 1719.16] Men in Black, keyboard, Google.
[1719.32 → 1720.06] Let's see what happens here.
[1720.26 → 1722.30] So, if you look at this one, this is the Men in Black one.
[1722.38 → 1725.46] This is also a Kinesis Advantage right here.
[1726.46 → 1727.44] This is one in Men in Black.
[1727.52 → 1728.48] So, they've been around for a while.
[1729.00 → 1730.40] I think they got started in the late 80s.
[1730.40 → 1731.74] Or early 90s.
[1731.74 → 1738.38] So, I probably could have gotten one then, I'm guessing, when I tried it, because it would have been, like, maybe late 90s.
[1738.38 → 1739.68] So, they would have been available.
[1740.08 → 1743.78] But, or whatever the Kinesis 1 is, I guess, would have been available at that time.
[1744.54 → 1746.08] But, yeah, I didn't have one of those.
[1746.16 → 1747.36] It was something weirder than that.
[1747.36 → 1748.78] Did no one catch this joke?
[1748.94 → 1749.64] No, I got it.
[1750.38 → 1751.26] I didn't even hear it.
[1751.90 → 1754.80] I'm not going to repeat it, but that was funny.
[1755.84 → 1757.04] The edit will catch it.
[1757.46 → 1757.66] Yeah.
[1758.06 → 1758.32] Yeah.
[1758.32 → 1760.10] What joke are we talking about?
[1760.10 → 1761.20] You want me to talk about My Keyboard Prime?
[1761.30 → 1761.82] Oh, yeah.
[1761.86 → 1762.60] Let's talk about yours.
[1762.90 → 1763.16] All right.
[1763.18 → 1764.22] First, we'll do some keys.
[1764.36 → 1765.84] I don't know if these sound good or not.
[1766.24 → 1770.46] I bought this from a random guy on Reddit, and then I've recommended him to, like, a hundred other people.
[1770.68 → 1772.40] So, shout out that guy on Reddit.
[1772.56 → 1776.06] I did not print this myself, but it is 3D printed, which is cool.
[1776.96 → 1777.86] I feel like.
[1778.42 → 1778.72] Oh, man.
[1778.72 → 1779.48] So, it's not as heavy.
[1780.62 → 1781.38] It doesn't look real.
[1781.38 → 1782.66] But it fits your hand really nice.
[1782.90 → 1783.10] You know?
[1783.16 → 1784.86] So, like, put your hands here.
[1786.00 → 1786.78] It feels good.
[1786.92 → 1787.44] Okay, here we go.
[1787.46 → 1787.72] Here we go.
[1787.74 → 1787.84] Ready?
[1788.32 → 1789.56] Here we'll turn it up all the way.
[1793.62 → 1794.88] So, I will say this.
[1794.88 → 1794.98] Sounds okay.
[1795.40 → 1801.66] I would probably be better at the split key, but I'm not a good, like, touch typer or whatever you call it.
[1801.70 → 1802.00] Home row.
[1802.10 → 1808.64] So, I think that was also, like, I realized, like, once I got a split keyboard, I was like, oh, I'm, like, reaching with some of my hands.
[1808.72 → 1809.78] So, I cross over.
[1809.86 → 1810.46] Like, I use, like.
[1810.80 → 1811.50] Oh, no.
[1811.62 → 1811.96] Trash.
[1812.38 → 1813.34] Come on, dude.
[1813.36 → 1813.98] I'm with Trash.
[1814.12 → 1815.06] I do the same thing.
[1815.06 → 1818.00] That's one of the problems I had when switching to the ergonomic one.
[1818.00 → 1819.70] It's like, I'm all over the place.
[1819.92 → 1821.44] I can't be tamed.
[1821.68 → 1822.38] I can't be tamed.
[1822.72 → 1824.54] I have to be all over the place on that keyboard.
[1824.86 → 1825.20] You know what I'm saying?
[1825.20 → 1825.48] Yeah.
[1825.60 → 1829.18] Like, you know how you're supposed to rest your hands on, like, the like, pointy fingers on the J?
[1829.50 → 1829.70] Yeah.
[1829.88 → 1831.64] I'm actually shifted over one.
[1831.94 → 1832.30] Oh, yeah.
[1832.30 → 1832.94] I should say.
[1833.04 → 1836.32] Because when I'm in him, I go, like, JK with my middle finger and ring finger.
[1836.76 → 1837.24] So, I'm, like.
[1837.30 → 1838.38] So, I'm super jacked up.
[1838.68 → 1838.96] All right.
[1839.56 → 1839.80] All right.
[1840.20 → 1840.42] Yeah.
[1840.42 → 1842.16] I type with the correct fingers on stuff.
[1842.38 → 1842.68] I got.
[1842.78 → 1843.18] I didn't even say.
[1843.22 → 1844.26] This is a dactyl manifold.
[1844.40 → 1845.30] I mean, one half of it.
[1845.32 → 1847.54] The other side still has other stuff connected to it.
[1847.56 → 1848.58] So, I didn't want to unplug at all.
[1848.72 → 1849.10] But there you go.
[1849.10 → 1849.12] Yeah.
[1849.12 → 1850.28] So, that's the kind of keyboard.
[1850.28 → 1851.52] I was watching you type at the tower.
[1851.60 → 1855.72] And I was like, man, he's like a proper touch typer or whatever you call that.
[1855.86 → 1856.24] I was like, eh.
[1856.60 → 1857.66] Skill issue on my end, for sure.
[1857.66 → 1859.40] Dude, you've typed for how many years?
[1859.46 → 1860.66] And you still don't know how to do it right?
[1861.04 → 1862.62] I type, but I type wrong.
[1863.02 → 1863.54] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1863.64 → 1863.94] What do you mean?
[1863.94 → 1864.90] What is this right?
[1865.20 → 1865.90] How is that right?
[1865.90 → 1870.34] It's just something that secretaries came up with in the 50s or something.
[1871.00 → 1871.64] Home row?
[1871.92 → 1872.28] What's that?
[1873.58 → 1875.56] I'm supposed to be the old guy here?
[1875.62 → 1876.82] What do you mean, you people?
[1880.70 → 1881.06] Yeah.
[1881.54 → 1882.08] All right.
[1882.14 → 1882.66] Hey, everybody.
[1882.78 → 1883.20] It was great.
[1883.60 → 1884.14] See you guys.
[1886.08 → 1887.16] Let's hear your keyboard.
[1887.38 → 1887.50] Okay.
[1887.60 → 1891.04] If you're still typing home row, man, you're stuck in the past.
[1891.46 → 1892.24] Home row is out.
[1893.28 → 1895.48] Dude, I will gate keep this.
[1895.48 → 1896.10] You're wrong.
[1896.82 → 1897.56] Oh, wow.
[1897.66 → 1897.92] Okay.
[1898.00 → 1898.28] Why?
[1899.28 → 1902.20] Because it literally is designed to fit your hand.
[1904.00 → 1905.70] The QWERTY keyboard?
[1906.52 → 1907.76] Just keyboards in general.
[1907.90 → 1911.84] If you put your hands in the same position, everything's in the same position, and then
[1911.84 → 1913.72] you don't have to play the game of where's my hands.
[1914.70 → 1918.38] Maybe for your ergonomic keyboards, that's true.
[1918.46 → 1923.22] But a normal QWERTY keyboard was just designed because they didn't want the typewriter bars
[1923.22 → 1924.08] to get caught.
[1924.08 → 1926.84] I mean, it's very much not in the right place.
[1926.86 → 1928.28] I think you guys are talking about different things.
[1928.38 → 1933.78] I'm saying the literal keys on the keyboard, regardless of what happens when you're typing
[1933.78 → 1936.72] them, they're designed to be hit by certain fingers.
[1937.34 → 1939.76] The layout QWERTY is not good.
[1940.08 → 1944.12] And it is a fun historical fact that it was designed to slow people down.
[1944.20 → 1944.38] Yeah.
[1944.56 → 1945.64] No, it's not designed to slow down.
[1945.72 → 1948.20] It's just designed to have maximum distance between things hitting.
[1948.20 → 1950.56] And so that way you don't jam your typewriter.
[1950.74 → 1951.84] But yes, TJ's right.
[1951.94 → 1953.98] It's not about the typewriter.
[1954.12 → 1958.36] It's about the fact that if you keep your hands in place, all the keys are accessible
[1958.36 → 1961.42] and you don't have to move your fingers, or you don't have to move your hands around.
[1961.94 → 1963.80] All keys are, like, that's the whole point of a keyboard.
[1963.92 → 1967.58] So if you don't put your hands in the right place, then you have to, like, move stuff around.
[1967.68 → 1969.16] You have to look down if you get off centre.
[1969.46 → 1973.54] That's why they even have little nipples on the J and the F so you can kind of feel it.
[1973.54 → 1974.40] So you don't even have to look at it.
[1974.40 → 1977.44] Does Trash have, does Trash's keyboard have those too?
[1978.00 → 1979.44] I don't even want to know.
[1979.44 → 1982.62] My keyboard has how many nipples does yours have, Trash?
[1985.70 → 1987.10] All right, TJ, show off your sound.
[1987.22 → 1988.04] Give me some sounds here.
[1988.14 → 1988.68] I did, I did.
[1988.72 → 1989.76] I'll do it one more time.
[1990.48 → 1993.40] Because chat said it sounded good.
[1996.42 → 1997.54] That's pretty hockey, right?
[1997.54 → 1998.36] Okay, so is that hockey?
[1998.48 → 1999.26] Is that what hockey is?
[1999.28 → 1999.80] I think that's shock.
[2000.26 → 2001.50] That feels a little hockey to me.
[2001.92 → 2002.54] Yeah, I don't know.
[2002.54 → 2004.26] Like I said, I don't know anything about keyboards.
[2004.42 → 2007.92] I had a so I started regular keyboard.
[2008.10 → 2009.44] I was pretty fast typist on that.
[2009.54 → 2011.84] But I started getting some wrist pain in college.
[2011.94 → 2014.46] I'm like, I'm way too young to have this problem.
[2014.76 → 2015.76] Like, this isn't good.
[2015.98 → 2018.00] I also was doing a lot of percussion.
[2018.36 → 2021.94] Like, I played percussion decently through college and stuff too.
[2022.00 → 2024.14] So I was, like, doing a lot of stuff.
[2024.32 → 2025.30] By percussion, you mean xylophone.
[2026.10 → 2028.22] I did play, I played all of them in college.
[2028.40 → 2028.66] Yes.
[2029.70 → 2032.26] Xylophone, marimba, timpani, you know, all this stuff.
[2032.26 → 2033.90] I do have a marimba in my office.
[2034.02 → 2034.38] It's true.
[2034.70 → 2035.20] That's awesome.
[2035.98 → 2037.92] So it's over here.
[2038.08 → 2038.96] It's kind of hard to show.
[2039.26 → 2040.32] But I'll show it in a sec.
[2041.96 → 2045.26] But I was like, this is way too early for my hands to, like, start falling apart.
[2045.42 → 2046.16] That doesn't seem good.
[2046.20 → 2047.14] There has to be a way to fix it.
[2047.14 → 2052.16] Got an Ergodox EZ, which is basically, like, their first version of the Moon lander.
[2052.96 → 2054.50] Split keyboard, thumb cluster.
[2055.10 → 2058.00] Hands felt much better, like, after getting that.
[2058.80 → 2062.80] And then saw Prime try out Concavity.
[2062.90 → 2063.98] I was like, I'll give it a try.
[2064.30 → 2065.96] I'll give Concavity a try.
[2066.08 → 2066.54] You know what I mean?
[2066.54 → 2073.24] But I didn't want to do Kinesis because I wanted to still be able to use QMK, which was, like, the thing to program the keyboard a little bit.
[2073.24 → 2079.02] Just because I wanted to test out some different stuff and do a few, like, some small customizations there.
[2079.08 → 2081.56] I think Kinesis pretty much has all the stuff like that.
[2081.56 → 2081.98] It has ZMK on the Pro.
[2082.18 → 2083.68] So you can ZMK it.
[2083.68 → 2086.58] But even now, like, I don't do anything super crazy with mine.
[2086.98 → 2091.26] It was just, like, stuff like if I tap the Z key, it types Z.
[2091.36 → 2093.44] But if I hold it, it's control, for example.
[2093.46 → 2093.80] I'm a Norrie.
[2093.86 → 2094.36] What's ZMK?
[2095.42 → 2102.50] It's, like, a way to write code that goes onto the keyboard to control, like, what happens when you press certain keys.
[2102.70 → 2103.88] Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[2103.88 → 2106.60] Yeah, so it's, like, you basically, like, load it up.
[2106.76 → 2108.26] You flash it onto your keyboard.
[2108.62 → 2109.90] Oh, that's the one that's the one that I have on my Voyager.
[2110.06 → 2111.26] I could use, like, some QM.
[2111.26 → 2111.58] Exactly.
[2111.68 → 2113.60] They probably had QMK or ZMK, one of the two.
[2113.68 → 2121.80] And basically, it's, like, a build system where, like, they make it really easy to flash it onto a bunch of different keyboards,
[2121.94 → 2126.30] but have a bunch of, like, shared kind of, like, library, basically, for doing stuff.
[2126.60 → 2131.84] So it makes it really easy to do stuff like, you know, when I tap Z, it types a Z key.
[2131.84 → 2136.92] When I hold it, it does control, which I like because then I'm just, like, stretching my pinky, like, less.
[2137.34 → 2140.34] What do you do if you want to just, like, say that someone's sleeping?
[2140.50 → 2140.84] Like, you want ZZZ.
[2141.70 → 2143.36] I just type several Zs.
[2143.36 → 2144.52] Just tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[2144.62 → 2145.34] Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[2145.34 → 2146.62] No, he'd use his pinky case.
[2146.66 → 2147.58] He wouldn't use his first finger.
[2147.58 → 2147.76] Oh, sorry.
[2147.76 → 2148.44] He knows how to type.
[2148.56 → 2149.38] Remember how we talked about it?
[2149.38 → 2150.38] Okay, this is ridiculous.
[2150.68 → 2151.62] I don't know.
[2151.74 → 2153.98] Like, are you guys, like, superfast typists or something?
[2154.56 → 2157.62] TJ is by far the fastest of the typists, but I'm 120 average.
[2157.96 → 2159.64] I think TJ is, like, 140 average.
[2160.22 → 2162.84] I can type, like, 150 to 160.
[2163.30 → 2164.08] That's really fast.
[2164.08 → 2164.36] I'm focused.
[2164.74 → 2171.02] And then, but, like, regular typing, like, yeah, 140, like, all hit consistently with 100% accuracy.
[2171.40 → 2172.00] I have a question.
[2172.12 → 2176.26] When you were growing up on the internet, did you guys ever do the uppercase, lowercase typing?
[2176.84 → 2177.14] Yes.
[2177.26 → 2177.60] What's that?
[2177.68 → 2179.16] Yes, I do it with the SpongeBob case one?
[2179.16 → 2179.38] Yes.
[2179.38 → 2181.36] I properly hold the shift on which side.
[2181.82 → 2185.16] Trash, I wrote a Neal Vim plugin that does it automatically.
[2185.30 → 2185.62] Oh, dude.
[2185.62 → 2186.12] I used to be so good at it.
[2186.12 → 2190.42] You can type, and it will switch cases every other letter, depending on your column.
[2190.80 → 2193.74] So you can just type it, and then it'll do it SpongeBob and Vim.
[2194.70 → 2196.56] Okay, I actually have a side story real quick.
[2196.76 → 2197.24] Okay, hit it.
[2197.36 → 2197.58] Yes.
[2197.78 → 2201.28] So when AOL first came out way back when, there were these anime chat rooms.
[2202.10 → 2202.38] Shocking.
[2202.38 → 2203.92] This is going to our wholesome place.
[2204.48 → 2208.26] So in these chat rooms, you could have, like.
[2209.34 → 2213.40] So, yeah, you do the classic ASL, but in these anime chat rooms, like, for instance,
[2213.50 → 2215.42] I would always join just, like, Dragon Ball Z1.
[2216.12 → 2218.16] You could have actual, like, battles.
[2218.30 → 2219.56] Like, you could fight them, right?
[2219.76 → 2220.00] Okay.
[2220.06 → 2225.60] And the way you represent that would be, like, I'm going to type it in chat real quick.
[2227.26 → 2227.88] Oh, my God.
[2227.90 → 2229.22] I can't type because there's too much pressure.
[2230.08 → 2231.34] So you do, like, something like that.
[2231.38 → 2231.82] So look in chat.
[2231.90 → 2235.60] So it's, like, colon, colon, charging spirit bomb or whatever.
[2235.88 → 2239.06] And you're just sitting here in this chat with just, like, a bunch of random people
[2239.06 → 2240.46] just doing that over and over.
[2240.54 → 2244.16] And you're just, like, dodge, colon, colon, dodge, colon, colon, jump.
[2244.16 → 2246.52] And, like, I got really, like, fast at typing with, like.
[2247.14 → 2248.24] How do you win, Travis?
[2248.30 → 2248.48] Yeah.
[2248.92 → 2250.32] Like, do you get kicked out of the chat room?
[2250.44 → 2251.16] You're just saying.
[2251.64 → 2254.98] Whoever gets the phone call first to kick them offline ends up losing.
[2255.76 → 2256.78] It's just Warping.
[2256.84 → 2261.48] I thought you were saying they had some complicated text-based adventure Dragon Ball Z game.
[2261.70 → 2262.04] But no.
[2262.82 → 2263.18] Yeah.
[2263.34 → 2263.92] It was.
[2264.18 → 2264.56] Yeah.
[2265.02 → 2265.32] I don't know.
[2265.32 → 2265.72] I'm just, like.
[2266.00 → 2267.28] I do like that idea, though.
[2267.28 → 2268.78] Twitch chat Dragon Ball Z.
[2268.94 → 2270.20] And if you lose, you get banned.
[2270.78 → 2273.70] It's just, like, charging spirit bomb.
[2275.08 → 2275.54] All right.
[2275.54 → 2277.02] I got a couple more keyboards for you guys.
[2277.82 → 2278.02] All right.
[2278.02 → 2278.28] Just do it.
[2278.38 → 2278.64] All right.
[2278.76 → 2280.14] Well, really, it's just a couple more switches.
[2280.44 → 2281.68] Because I have several of them.
[2281.74 → 2284.62] So I also played around with the Glove 80.
[2285.74 → 2288.88] So this one is, like, ultra-thin, ultra light.
[2289.42 → 2292.66] And so if you want to get into these, it's a lot cheaper than a Kinesis.
[2293.24 → 2296.06] I would move it when I type just because it was too light for me.
[2296.08 → 2297.58] And I kind of type with the power hand.
[2298.00 → 2300.52] You know, like, my fingers come in at, like, a high speed.
[2300.52 → 2301.62] And so I'd actually lift.
[2301.62 → 2303.24] He hits the keyboard really hard when he types.
[2303.48 → 2305.78] So, like, for a lot of you, Chad, it probably would not be an issue.
[2306.02 → 2306.04] Yeah.
[2306.10 → 2306.26] Yeah.
[2306.40 → 2308.36] For me, this is, like, a personal issue.
[2308.44 → 2309.84] But these are browns, if I'm not mistaken.
[2310.00 → 2311.82] I'd have to pull off a keycap to find it.
[2311.88 → 2312.56] I don't have a little tool.
[2312.68 → 2312.98] And I don't want.
[2313.26 → 2313.68] I hate trying, like, manuals.
[2313.68 → 2314.96] Are those replaceable switches?
[2315.36 → 2317.78] Are those replaceable switches or hardwired?
[2319.12 → 2320.18] Most of these are all hardware.
[2320.18 → 2323.78] I'd assume this is all, like, these are on the Kinesis.
[2323.92 → 2324.62] It's all, like, burnt in.
[2324.68 → 2325.82] They're not hot swappable ones.
[2325.84 → 2326.88] You can't do anything like that.
[2327.38 → 2330.56] And so with this one here, let me turn up the proper microphone.
[2330.68 → 2333.70] This would be some browns because I know everyone loves the sound.
[2333.80 → 2334.36] So here you go.
[2334.48 → 2335.68] Here are some browns for you.
[2336.04 → 2336.88] Browns on a thin body.
[2336.96 → 2339.06] So the guitar acoustics aren't as good.
[2341.30 → 2341.62] Yeah.
[2341.82 → 2343.70] Yeah, they're pretty cliquey for a brown.
[2344.40 → 2346.78] Yeah, they're cliquey, but they're also Clancy, right?
[2346.80 → 2347.58] They're not even cliquey.
[2347.70 → 2347.98] Yeah.
[2348.62 → 2349.66] Here are some reds.
[2349.66 → 2351.90] Or actually, these are some browns on a Kinesis.
[2355.14 → 2356.16] It's kind of the same.
[2356.64 → 2357.94] Yeah, it's a little better, maybe.
[2357.96 → 2359.70] A lot of plastic clack in there.
[2359.94 → 2362.96] And then here is a 60 with some whites.
[2366.14 → 2366.80] That's better.
[2367.04 → 2367.80] So what's the white key?
[2367.90 → 2369.36] Is it the white key, like, in the same level as the blue?
[2369.98 → 2373.24] It could be the mic as well that's kind of giving it a little bit more twang to it.
[2373.48 → 2375.12] Why are you not just doing it on your...
[2375.12 → 2377.70] Hold it to the microphone you have right in front of your lips.
[2377.70 → 2380.14] I know, but it doesn't pick it up as easy.
[2381.20 → 2382.46] No, that sounds perfect.
[2382.58 → 2383.58] It's way better sounding.
[2383.80 → 2384.12] That's way better.
[2384.14 → 2385.40] It's a thousand times better.
[2386.52 → 2387.12] Oh, that sounds good.
[2387.12 → 2388.18] It's like a different keyboard.
[2388.42 → 2389.42] No, that sounds good.
[2389.42 → 2391.34] All right, stop before trash goes too far.
[2391.34 → 2391.98] Dude, wait in time.
[2392.06 → 2394.36] Go back and run us back on the other ones.
[2394.44 → 2395.14] So that was a white.
[2395.50 → 2396.26] So that was a white.
[2396.26 → 2399.26] These are pinks.
[2403.14 → 2405.64] It literally sounds like my kids are running around upstairs.
[2405.64 → 2406.58] I didn't know these colours existed.
[2406.82 → 2407.00] Pinks?
[2407.12 → 2407.82] I never even...
[2407.82 → 2408.58] These are...
[2408.58 → 2410.02] You never heard of pink before trash?
[2410.24 → 2410.80] It's a colour.
[2411.10 → 2413.14] These are jades, as Casey is familiar with.
[2415.54 → 2416.36] Oh, those are...
[2416.36 → 2417.60] Yeah, they do sound pretty heavy.
[2417.82 → 2418.76] He's so stupid.
[2420.20 → 2421.26] And then...
[2421.26 → 2421.52] Let's see.
[2421.72 → 2422.64] These would be...
[2422.64 → 2424.38] Actually, these might be brown or red.
[2424.38 → 2426.60] I don't know, and I don't have a thing to pull off the keyboard cap.
[2429.06 → 2429.70] I'm going to be honest.
[2429.74 → 2430.84] They all sound the same at this point.
[2432.22 → 2435.88] Chat going, can confirm pink is a colour trash.
[2437.94 → 2438.94] Yeah, these will sound like blues.
[2438.94 → 2440.94] The Glove 80 definitely has like the...
[2440.94 → 2444.40] It's worth noting that there's like...
[2444.40 → 2445.84] The colour doesn't really tell you much,
[2445.90 → 2448.62] because there's like 50,000 different switches that are all pink.
[2449.74 → 2450.10] But...
[2450.10 → 2451.76] These were Kale box pink.
[2452.30 → 2452.90] Box pinks.
[2452.96 → 2453.10] Okay.
[2453.10 → 2454.78] So, slightly...
[2454.78 → 2455.28] What's that mean?
[2455.28 → 2457.12] Slightly more forgiving than the box jade.
[2457.28 → 2458.56] Yeah, they're very heavy, though.
[2458.66 → 2461.30] And they definitely have a much more like of a thump sound.
[2461.48 → 2462.00] Like, they don't...
[2462.00 → 2465.00] They're not nearly as Blackett-clickety as the box jades.
[2465.44 → 2466.38] What's a box?
[2466.52 → 2467.16] Pink box.
[2467.28 → 2468.92] We just described what a box is.
[2469.00 → 2470.96] Like, that's why we're all impressed by it.
[2470.98 → 2472.52] It's the thing that allows it to be more stable.
[2473.20 → 2473.34] Trash.
[2473.64 → 2473.94] Oh!
[2474.04 → 2474.70] We don't have to...
[2474.70 → 2476.04] Oh, when you wiggle it, it's more wiggly.
[2476.28 → 2476.54] Yes, yes.
[2476.54 → 2477.64] Yeah, we don't have to explain it again.
[2477.68 → 2479.26] He's going to forget in 15 minutes anyway.
[2479.28 → 2480.44] I don't have a box, I don't think.
[2480.48 → 2481.40] These things are wiggly, wiggly.
[2481.40 → 2484.88] Yeah, most switches are not box switches, but there are...
[2484.88 → 2489.76] For people who really want the key not to move at all, it just goes only up and down
[2489.76 → 2491.52] and never side to side at all.
[2491.74 → 2493.40] Is that an actual problem for someone?
[2493.84 → 2496.50] It's not a problem or not, it's just, do you like that?
[2496.58 → 2500.40] Like, if you put those in there, you may find that you like it better.
[2500.50 → 2501.14] You don't want...
[2501.14 → 2503.64] You like it to not kind of move with your finger.
[2503.74 → 2505.00] Now that I'm conscious, like, I can...
[2505.00 → 2505.88] It's like super noticeable.
[2505.88 → 2507.84] Yes, and so some people don't like that.
[2507.84 → 2509.16] Trash is about to go buy three new keyboards.
[2509.48 → 2510.90] Yeah, Trash, I can get some new ones, honestly.
[2511.04 → 2512.98] Hey, guys, I got some boxed something.
[2514.16 → 2515.44] Hey, fellow kids.
[2516.86 → 2517.80] Hey, guys, check this out.
[2517.86 → 2518.36] No wiggle.
[2518.70 → 2519.20] Okay, so...
[2519.20 → 2520.86] Have you guys heard of box switches?
[2521.02 → 2521.78] I mean, they're all the...
[2521.78 → 2522.64] I think they're pretty cool.
[2522.72 → 2523.80] I don't know if you guys have heard of them.
[2524.10 → 2524.32] Yeah.
[2524.44 → 2526.14] Just got my new box switches in.
[2526.54 → 2527.26] It's no big deal.
[2527.92 → 2529.16] Anyway, what are we talking about today?
[2529.26 → 2531.56] How much money is too much money to spend on keyboards?
[2531.56 → 2533.34] Like, where is the cutoff line?
[2534.72 → 2537.42] Well, it depends a lot on...
[2537.42 → 2539.84] I haven't looked at what the kind of prices are recently,
[2539.96 → 2542.82] but I'm imagining with all crazy stuff like tariffs
[2542.82 → 2543.64] and all these sorts of things,
[2543.70 → 2548.06] a lot of this stuff is like you order it from some random place
[2548.06 → 2549.20] in Taiwan or something,
[2549.38 → 2551.60] and who knows how that's been affected.
[2551.80 → 2554.42] So at least back when I bought these,
[2554.96 → 2558.64] you can build a pretty darn good keyboard
[2558.64 → 2561.02] with whatever switches and keycaps you want
[2561.02 → 2563.16] and a nice solid body and all that sort of stuff.
[2563.62 → 2566.58] If you're anything north of $200,
[2566.74 → 2570.08] you're probably a little overspending, maybe.
[2570.46 → 2572.18] But, you know, certainly for over $300,
[2572.38 → 2574.44] you're probably spending way too much money.
[2574.82 → 2577.48] And this is good because if you buy one
[2577.48 → 2579.44] that's in the reasonable range there,
[2579.96 → 2580.80] you're...
[2580.80 → 2582.44] Like I said, you can use this forever.
[2582.88 → 2584.96] Like, they last...
[2584.96 → 2585.68] They're so durable.
[2585.68 → 2588.90] And so even in the time that I've just had these,
[2589.02 → 2590.16] I would have had to have bought
[2590.16 → 2592.90] two of the old kinds of keyboards I used to have.
[2593.00 → 2594.72] So these ended up actually being cheaper,
[2594.86 → 2596.62] even though they're much fancier
[2596.62 → 2600.02] because the base price isn't really all that different,
[2600.12 → 2601.10] but they last so much longer.
[2601.34 → 2601.44] Question.
[2601.58 → 2602.64] I have a big question.
[2602.72 → 2603.92] How many hours did it take for you
[2603.92 → 2605.68] to put in all the spray foam and everything else?
[2607.02 → 2607.86] Well, you know,
[2607.94 → 2610.10] this is really a question of experience
[2610.10 → 2612.84] because now I can do one of these in 30 minutes.
[2616.76 → 2617.44] Wrecked, Brian.
[2618.52 → 2618.88] Yeah.
[2619.08 → 2619.64] And I have.
[2620.04 → 2621.78] I've done them because I sent one to John.
[2621.78 → 2623.36] I sent one to John Blow, for example.
[2623.98 → 2625.42] I made a keyboard for him.
[2625.46 → 2626.80] You want to try ceramic keys?
[2627.18 → 2629.04] Did you put Trash's kind of keys on there?
[2629.04 → 2629.84] Oh, you're making keyboards?
[2629.84 → 2633.78] Dude, if you could definitely put some anime on there.
[2634.58 → 2634.94] No.
[2636.06 → 2639.50] And so, like, I've built so many of these now.
[2639.50 → 2641.98] I've built, like, three of them total, I guess,
[2642.12 → 2643.76] and the first one was very slow.
[2643.86 → 2644.94] The second one was pretty fast.
[2645.00 → 2646.10] The third one was quite fast.
[2646.14 → 2647.20] So I can just do them now.
[2647.42 → 2648.50] But when you first do it,
[2648.50 → 2650.14] you don't know what the heck is going on, right?
[2650.16 → 2651.38] And the instructions are terrible.
[2651.62 → 2653.54] So, you know, if there even are any,
[2653.58 → 2654.46] which a lot of times there aren't.
[2654.50 → 2656.34] So you're just like, you just have these pieces.
[2656.46 → 2658.20] You're like, okay, where does this go?
[2658.26 → 2660.60] And eventually, oh, that goes icy.
[2660.74 → 2662.72] You take apart this part of the PCB.
[2662.90 → 2664.00] You put that inside it.
[2664.06 → 2664.88] You put it back down.
[2664.94 → 2666.18] Like, okay, I get it, right?
[2666.42 → 2667.64] Once you know that, you're just like,
[2667.64 → 2670.32] the thing that takes the longest
[2670.32 → 2672.48] is pulling the keycaps and the switches.
[2672.90 → 2673.88] That's what takes the longest
[2673.88 → 2676.50] because it's 100 plus of those, right?
[2677.04 → 2678.44] Do you have to solder them yourselves too?
[2679.16 → 2679.60] No, no, no.
[2679.64 → 2680.30] They click in.
[2680.54 → 2681.52] Oh, they're hot-swappable ones.
[2681.52 → 2682.90] Do you guys lube the keys and stuff?
[2683.08 → 2684.00] I've never lubed the key.
[2684.00 → 2684.28] I don't lube, but.
[2684.30 → 2684.62] Trash.
[2685.10 → 2686.96] Dude, relax, okay?
[2687.10 → 2688.40] We do not need to be talking about that
[2688.40 → 2689.24] with your keys, okay?
[2689.38 → 2689.54] Yeah.
[2689.54 → 2690.22] Dang.
[2691.62 → 2694.42] These lube-thick hentai keys
[2694.42 → 2696.18] that Trash is working on.
[2696.18 → 2696.58] Immediately.
[2697.00 → 2697.16] Yeah.
[2697.40 → 2697.58] Okay.
[2697.66 → 2698.98] I was asking a real question.
[2699.20 → 2701.18] No, I think mine are Trash.
[2701.54 → 2702.34] Yeah, but they can't.
[2702.40 → 2702.86] No, no, no.
[2702.90 → 2703.86] You can't think they are
[2703.86 → 2705.16] because lube doesn't last forever.
[2705.82 → 2706.70] Well, they used to be.
[2706.84 → 2708.00] Yeah, you can over-lube too
[2708.00 → 2708.68] and they get sticky.
[2709.16 → 2710.76] Yeah, there's factory lubed ones
[2710.76 → 2712.30] that just come that way.
[2713.10 → 2713.48] Oh, God.
[2713.54 → 2714.44] Those phrases are terrible.
[2714.78 → 2715.76] Are you okay, Casey?
[2716.16 → 2716.40] Yeah.
[2716.80 → 2718.86] Casey, this is a family-friendly show, okay?
[2718.86 → 2719.36] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2720.16 → 2721.88] There's factory lubed ones
[2721.88 → 2724.94] and those would just be the way they are
[2724.94 → 2726.02] right when you get them.
[2726.26 → 2727.54] But then, yeah, people do.
[2728.02 → 2729.36] Dude, the way you said it,
[2729.40 → 2730.12] it was just like,
[2730.12 → 2732.00] it was very dirty.
[2732.64 → 2733.90] I didn't even know what to do with it.
[2734.08 → 2735.10] You're like very aggressive.
[2735.40 → 2737.46] But if you want to lube them yourself,
[2737.62 → 2739.12] yeah, then you're getting in there.
[2739.26 → 2740.58] You're getting right in there
[2740.58 → 2742.88] and you've got to do every little key you're on
[2742.88 → 2744.44] and you've got to work it up and down
[2744.44 → 2746.58] to make sure that the lube gets all in there
[2746.58 → 2747.28] the way it should.
[2747.28 → 2749.76] And so that's a bigger investment.
[2749.90 → 2750.86] So I don't do that.
[2751.70 → 2755.38] And I don't mind the feel of the ones currently,
[2755.60 → 2757.42] but I'm sure some people are like,
[2757.48 → 2758.52] oh, man, if they're not lubed,
[2758.62 → 2761.48] then it's just not good at all.
[2762.00 → 2762.66] Do you trash?
[2762.76 → 2763.52] Do you lube them up?
[2764.58 → 2768.00] So the GMMK one, this one,
[2768.04 → 2769.36] so I didn't even know anything about lubing
[2769.36 → 2770.22] until I got this thing.
[2770.48 → 2771.28] This thing was over lubed.
[2771.28 → 2771.88] Over lubed.
[2772.20 → 2774.48] I hit the space bar as soon as I opened it
[2774.48 → 2776.86] and it just stayed pressed down.
[2777.18 → 2777.50] And I was like,
[2777.54 → 2778.70] what the heck is wrong on this keyboard?
[2778.74 → 2779.62] I paid so much money.
[2779.92 → 2780.84] So then I opened it up.
[2780.90 → 2782.80] I just saw all this lube everywhere
[2782.80 → 2783.56] and I was just like, ugh.
[2783.72 → 2784.54] What did they do?
[2784.62 → 2785.10] No, wait.
[2785.18 → 2786.40] How did that make any sense?
[2786.48 → 2789.06] How does lubing make it not?
[2789.38 → 2790.62] Because it was globed.
[2790.76 → 2792.44] It was just globed up.
[2792.66 → 2793.60] So when you push it,
[2793.68 → 2795.02] it almost felt like,
[2795.18 → 2797.72] you know when you squeeze an Umber's glue bottle
[2797.72 → 2799.50] and you just put way too much on there,
[2799.54 → 2800.70] that's basically what it looked like.
[2801.20 → 2802.36] Relatable scenario, yeah.
[2803.24 → 2804.36] Why did they do that?
[2804.42 → 2805.16] What happened?
[2805.26 → 2806.36] Was it just a screw-up?
[2806.60 → 2807.06] I don't know,
[2807.12 → 2808.86] but right now the W one gets sticky.
[2808.94 → 2809.90] That's why I stopped using it.
[2809.90 → 2810.90] I was too lazy to open it.
[2810.98 → 2812.02] So I just bought a new keyboard.
[2812.26 → 2812.82] That's what it does.
[2813.24 → 2813.58] All right.
[2813.82 → 2814.24] All right.
[2815.52 → 2817.14] What is wrong with you?
[2817.64 → 2819.06] What do you mean what's wrong with me?
[2820.08 → 2821.68] I'll sell this one too if anyone wants this one.
[2821.68 → 2822.48] There you go.
[2823.88 → 2827.04] This is just turning into trash sells keyboards.
[2828.72 → 2830.80] Trash is doing a virtual garage sale.
[2830.98 → 2831.50] I love it.
[2834.12 → 2837.20] So this was supposed to be a gear episode,
[2837.32 → 2838.84] but all we talked about was keyboards
[2838.84 → 2839.94] and it's basically over.
[2840.06 → 2840.30] No, no.
[2840.30 → 2841.94] I don't think there's anything else we need to talk about
[2841.94 → 2843.42] because I don't find mice that interesting.
[2844.34 → 2844.44] Right?
[2844.50 → 2845.38] I mean, generally speaking,
[2845.38 → 2846.80] I use a keyboard to type all day.
[2846.88 → 2847.92] So if I have to use a mouse,
[2847.96 → 2848.96] I don't really care.
[2849.34 → 2850.04] Like the magic mouse,
[2850.04 → 2851.54] I find actually super inconvenient
[2851.54 → 2852.88] because you can't really touch it.
[2853.30 → 2854.98] The moment you touch it incorrectly,
[2855.16 → 2855.60] it's just like,
[2855.98 → 2857.46] oh, hey, I swiped left for you, dog.
[2857.46 → 2858.04] I got it.
[2858.10 → 2858.58] And you're just like,
[2858.60 → 2859.36] I don't want to do that.
[2859.36 → 2859.82] You can turn that off.
[2859.82 → 2860.70] I don't want that.
[2861.02 → 2862.84] Dude, then why buy such a stupid mouse?
[2862.94 → 2865.26] Like why not just have a tactile button
[2865.26 → 2867.10] instead of some weird touch button?
[2867.10 → 2867.76] Will you stop attacking me?
[2867.98 → 2870.16] Because it's magic.
[2870.72 → 2871.44] It's a magic mouse.
[2872.08 → 2873.14] This is literally how I scroll,
[2873.26 → 2873.70] like a phone.
[2875.30 → 2875.90] Wait, hold on.
[2875.94 → 2876.60] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2876.72 → 2877.88] Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[2877.96 → 2878.30] Hold on.
[2878.30 → 2878.82] I scrolled my phone.
[2878.96 → 2880.94] You pick up your mouse like a phone.
[2880.94 → 2881.38] No, no, no.
[2881.38 → 2882.06] I'm just showing you
[2882.06 → 2883.00] because I got to show the camera.
[2883.00 → 2884.50] Oh my goodness.
[2885.12 → 2885.86] I'm like this.
[2886.10 → 2886.36] I'm like.
[2887.52 → 2889.54] I thought you were saying
[2889.54 → 2890.22] you just literally,
[2890.36 → 2891.38] every time you wanted to scroll,
[2891.50 → 2892.08] you're like, bro.
[2892.08 → 2892.64] Next stand up,
[2892.70 → 2893.34] I'm just going to be here
[2893.34 → 2894.02] and look at a website.
[2894.28 → 2894.58] Computer.
[2895.46 → 2896.38] Computer, computer.
[2896.72 → 2899.44] Computer, please scroll the image now.
[2899.84 → 2900.66] Open Vim.
[2901.08 → 2901.40] Yes.
[2901.40 → 2901.62] No, no, no.
[2902.14 → 2903.34] Open Vim.
[2903.74 → 2906.10] Not order hentai keycaps.
[2906.82 → 2907.26] Pre-lubed.
[2907.26 → 2910.08] Oh, wait.
[2910.22 → 2910.64] I just like.
[2910.78 → 2911.60] That made me just say.
[2911.74 → 2913.76] Open or order hentai keycaps.
[2913.76 → 2914.90] What did it make you think of, Draft?
[2914.90 → 2915.42] Pre-lubed.
[2917.68 → 2918.10] All right.
[2918.10 → 2919.18] We're going to have to end this episode.
[2919.88 → 2920.18] Okay.
[2920.82 → 2921.40] That's fine.
[2921.72 → 2922.02] Now.
[2925.52 → 2926.56] Is there any other hardware
[2926.56 → 2927.70] that you find is super important?
[2927.76 → 2928.66] So I tried feed pedals
[2928.66 → 2930.02] or little pedals.
[2930.02 → 2930.66] Let's talk about it
[2930.66 → 2931.40] on a different episode.
[2931.62 → 2932.36] I want to talk more
[2932.36 → 2933.44] about the rest of our setups.
[2934.18 → 2935.16] But we're going to talk
[2935.16 → 2936.12] for two hours about it.
[2936.20 → 2936.44] Okay.
[2937.04 → 2937.82] Well, we also got to talk.
[2938.10 → 2939.24] This also because
[2939.24 → 2941.18] everyone on here
[2941.18 → 2942.22] is doing like streaming
[2942.22 → 2942.74] and things.
[2942.90 → 2943.58] We have to talk stuff
[2943.58 → 2944.94] like microphones too, right?
[2945.00 → 2945.36] Like there's.
[2945.46 → 2945.78] I know.
[2945.90 → 2946.40] None of us know
[2946.40 → 2947.18] what we're doing out here.
[2947.30 → 2947.54] Okay.
[2947.66 → 2947.80] Like.
[2948.00 → 2948.44] Are you serious?
[2948.58 → 2949.74] I want to ask Casey.
[2949.98 → 2950.30] Yeah, yeah.
[2950.30 → 2951.20] Casey, you don't know this?
[2951.32 → 2951.82] Yeah, Casey.
[2951.92 → 2953.00] I just want you to explain.
[2953.02 → 2953.32] Your stream setup video
[2953.32 → 2954.16] was the first thing
[2954.16 → 2954.84] that I ever used.
[2955.72 → 2956.34] Wait, what?
[2957.34 → 2958.04] Are you serious, TJ?
[2958.04 → 2959.22] You need to help us with this.
[2959.28 → 2959.44] Yeah.
[2960.26 → 2960.94] Can't hear anything.
[2961.14 → 2961.52] I don't have that phone call.
[2961.52 → 2962.62] That super crappy one
[2962.62 → 2963.72] where I had the lights
[2963.72 → 2964.58] around the thing.
[2964.82 → 2966.00] Well, it just gave me
[2966.00 → 2966.66] some inspiration
[2966.66 → 2967.56] for stuff to try out.
[2967.60 → 2967.92] But yes,
[2968.04 → 2968.68] like that was when
[2968.68 → 2969.30] I was first starting
[2969.30 → 2970.16] like five years ago.
[2970.62 → 2970.88] All right.
[2970.88 → 2971.54] I found your video.
[2972.14 → 2973.02] Okay, then I guess
[2973.02 → 2974.34] we do have to talk about this.
[2974.68 → 2974.90] Yeah.
[2975.38 → 2976.18] You guys are pros.
[2976.34 → 2978.02] You should have all the things.
[2978.02 → 2978.60] No, no, no, no.
[2978.60 → 2980.14] You should know all the things
[2980.14 → 2981.36] that there are in the world.
[2982.74 → 2983.74] I've got a ring light.
[2984.14 → 2984.76] Pretty cool.
[2985.32 → 2985.96] All right.
[2986.92 → 2987.28] Yes.
[2988.08 → 2988.98] I'm using an iPhone
[2988.98 → 2989.86] for my camera.
[2990.52 → 2990.84] What?
[2991.58 → 2991.90] Yeah.
[2992.22 → 2992.62] No joke.
[2993.02 → 2993.68] This right here?
[2993.76 → 2994.24] This is iPhone.
[2994.24 → 2994.40] It looks good.
[2995.36 → 2995.92] It's perfect.
[2996.20 → 2996.38] All right.
[2996.48 → 2997.08] It's super easy.
[2997.08 → 2997.66] By the way, Chad, Casey,
[2998.02 → 2999.00] Casey, everyone wants to,
[2999.08 → 3000.16] or Disco really wants to know,
[3000.24 → 3001.24] can you please ask Casey
[3001.24 → 3003.04] what kind of key cap profile
[3003.04 → 3003.42] he likes?
[3003.58 → 3004.50] DSA, Cherry,
[3005.04 → 3006.34] then there's Ellipse at the end,
[3006.38 → 3007.20] but it was only two dots.
[3007.30 → 3008.36] I assume that's an Ellipse.
[3009.30 → 3009.68] Yes.
[3009.82 → 3012.14] I apologize for not remembering.
[3012.30 → 3013.32] I had to look this up
[3013.32 → 3014.34] when I was ordering them
[3014.34 → 3015.36] and now I've forgotten.
[3015.58 → 3016.94] I will try to show you
[3016.94 → 3018.02] the profile here,
[3018.14 → 3019.54] but I forget exactly
[3019.54 → 3020.62] which one it was.
[3023.02 → 3023.76] Figure it out, Chad.
[3023.94 → 3024.64] Put that in AI.
[3024.92 → 3025.40] You got it.
[3025.58 → 3027.42] I can post this after
[3027.42 → 3028.48] because like, yeah,
[3028.60 → 3029.48] there's,
[3029.68 → 3031.84] I tried actually the real,
[3031.84 → 3033.46] there are ones that are very,
[3033.58 → 3034.38] very tall.
[3034.66 → 3034.92] Like,
[3035.38 → 3036.88] and I tried that for a little while
[3036.88 → 3038.54] and I did like,
[3039.02 → 3039.46] one of the things,
[3039.56 → 3040.80] here's the thing about keyboards.
[3040.94 → 3041.38] This is like,
[3041.58 → 3042.86] to bring it all the way back
[3042.86 → 3043.46] to the beginning,
[3043.72 → 3044.74] where we started from.
[3045.38 → 3046.86] One of the things about keyboards
[3046.86 → 3048.30] that is underappreciated,
[3048.38 → 3048.76] I think,
[3048.86 → 3050.38] if you are a programmer
[3050.38 → 3052.32] or even just someone
[3052.32 → 3053.48] who does a lot of work
[3053.48 → 3053.98] on a keyboard,
[3055.06 → 3057.52] variety actually is pretty cool.
[3058.04 → 3059.28] And maybe not
[3059.28 → 3061.08] if you're in the ergonomic zone
[3061.08 → 3061.60] where you're like,
[3061.70 → 3061.92] no,
[3062.02 → 3062.76] I'm all about,
[3062.86 → 3062.98] like,
[3063.00 → 3064.06] I've got to get it set up
[3064.06 → 3064.64] just for,
[3064.78 → 3065.02] you know,
[3065.10 → 3067.14] I'm trying to minimize hand pain
[3067.14 → 3068.28] and maximize words for a minute
[3068.28 → 3069.38] and whatever else,
[3069.44 → 3069.60] right?
[3069.68 → 3069.88] Okay,
[3069.90 → 3070.88] maybe not because you want it
[3070.88 → 3071.48] completely repeatable.
[3071.60 → 3072.78] But for me,
[3072.82 → 3073.22] it's like,
[3073.30 → 3073.58] oh,
[3073.92 → 3074.30] you know,
[3074.60 → 3075.58] having a variety
[3075.58 → 3076.04] where like,
[3076.20 → 3076.92] maybe I'm going to switch out
[3076.92 → 3077.54] my keycaps.
[3078.14 → 3079.16] Maybe I'm going to switch out
[3079.16 → 3079.88] my switches.
[3080.12 → 3080.88] I'm going to go cliquey
[3080.88 → 3081.54] for a month,
[3081.62 → 3082.02] right?
[3082.34 → 3083.48] It's actually fun.
[3083.86 → 3084.96] It just makes it fun
[3084.96 → 3085.48] to type,
[3085.52 → 3086.74] to have different stuff,
[3086.82 → 3087.08] right?
[3087.46 → 3088.04] And so,
[3088.14 → 3089.38] I did try for a little while
[3089.38 → 3090.92] taller keycaps that were more,
[3091.10 → 3092.90] and they were the cupped kind.
[3093.12 → 3093.14] So,
[3093.26 → 3094.28] the profiles,
[3094.44 → 3094.74] there's a bunch,
[3094.82 → 3094.94] you know,
[3095.02 → 3096.06] the key profiles with names
[3096.06 → 3097.02] I never remember
[3097.02 → 3098.26] because I just don't,
[3098.56 → 3098.70] you know,
[3098.72 → 3099.42] if I was building keyboards
[3099.42 → 3099.84] every day,
[3099.86 → 3100.28] I'd remember,
[3100.38 → 3100.52] right?
[3100.52 → 3101.70] But you do it every year
[3101.70 → 3102.12] or something,
[3102.16 → 3102.84] you don't remember
[3102.84 → 3104.16] what all the names are.
[3104.56 → 3106.44] There are ones that are very cupped,
[3106.62 → 3108.46] like your fingers and trash.
[3109.08 → 3110.20] I don't want to give you any ideas,
[3110.34 → 3112.24] but they cup those fingers.
[3112.52 → 3113.04] They are right,
[3113.12 → 3113.84] they are snug.
[3113.94 → 3115.04] They just make you feel
[3115.04 → 3116.24] like you are
[3116.24 → 3117.88] on a loving,
[3118.02 → 3118.86] the loving embrace
[3118.86 → 3120.82] of a cloud-like pillow cloud.
[3121.94 → 3123.08] Not where my head was going,
[3123.26 → 3123.42] but yeah,
[3123.48 → 3123.86] I agree.
[3124.30 → 3124.70] That,
[3125.12 → 3126.42] yeah.
[3127.14 → 3127.58] Anyway,
[3128.02 → 3128.62] those,
[3128.78 → 3130.06] they feel really great,
[3130.24 → 3131.08] they really do,
[3131.48 → 3132.94] but the typing experience
[3132.94 → 3133.64] isn't as good.
[3133.80 → 3135.70] They're too high for me,
[3135.84 → 3137.12] and I felt like there was
[3137.12 → 3137.80] too much travel,
[3137.96 → 3138.90] so I didn't end up
[3138.90 → 3139.62] sticking with those.
[3139.84 → 3140.26] But again,
[3140.30 → 3141.30] it's fun for a month,
[3141.48 → 3141.74] right?
[3141.74 → 3143.06] And so there are,
[3143.16 → 3144.16] so I have enjoyed
[3144.16 → 3145.40] the other kinds of keycaps
[3145.40 → 3145.92] in the past,
[3146.36 → 3147.56] and I've also tried
[3147.56 → 3149.34] the super low-profile ones.
[3149.94 → 3151.16] I just come back
[3151.16 → 3151.98] to the more classic,
[3152.48 → 3153.70] standard ones
[3153.70 → 3155.38] pretty much every time,
[3155.46 → 3155.92] because I just,
[3156.06 → 3156.26] you know,
[3156.34 → 3156.60] again,
[3156.70 → 3157.94] I'm trying to get back
[3157.94 → 3159.02] to the old Amiga feel.
[3159.40 → 3160.44] That's what I'm looking for.
[3161.42 → 3161.82] Amiga,
[3161.94 → 3162.14] of course,
[3162.18 → 3162.66] means girlfriend,
[3163.16 → 3164.74] so I guess that ties back
[3164.74 → 3165.26] into the trash.
[3165.28 → 3165.86] That works for you,
[3165.92 → 3166.16] trash.
[3166.26 → 3166.92] That works for the thing.
[3167.38 → 3167.70] But yeah,
[3167.88 → 3169.16] that's how I,
[3169.76 → 3170.56] so sorry,
[3170.72 → 3170.92] chat,
[3170.92 → 3172.02] but I'm pretty
[3172.02 → 3172.66] bog-standard
[3172.66 → 3173.52] on the profile thing.
[3175.58 → 3175.94] Okay,
[3176.22 → 3177.74] so what about,
[3177.80 → 3177.94] like,
[3178.00 → 3178.76] what about grams,
[3178.88 → 3179.44] like pressure?
[3179.62 → 3180.78] Is there a specific amount
[3180.78 → 3181.40] that you find to be
[3181.40 → 3182.28] too much or too little?
[3182.34 → 3182.60] Because I,
[3182.76 → 3182.94] you know,
[3182.98 → 3184.00] like riding with the pinks,
[3184.04 → 3185.56] they're like 65 or 75,
[3186.08 → 3187.66] and my box shades
[3187.66 → 3188.30] are like 55,
[3188.44 → 3189.00] and I actually feel
[3189.00 → 3189.74] such a difference
[3189.74 → 3190.32] that right now
[3190.32 → 3191.36] it hurts my right wrist,
[3191.40 → 3191.92] so I actually have
[3191.92 → 3192.92] two separate keyboards.
[3193.22 → 3194.14] I like the sound of pink
[3194.14 → 3194.76] on one side,
[3195.04 → 3195.70] and then I go,
[3195.74 → 3197.14] I go cliquey on one side,
[3197.46 → 3199.06] more chunky on the other side,
[3199.16 → 3200.20] because it's kind of fun,
[3200.20 → 3202.02] and so I kind of do both,
[3202.06 → 3202.48] and I was wondering,
[3202.56 → 3203.12] especially since you
[3203.12 → 3203.80] hot replace them,
[3203.82 → 3204.52] do you ever do like
[3204.52 → 3205.76] a mixture of them,
[3205.80 → 3206.72] so each key kind of
[3206.72 → 3207.50] has a bit of a little,
[3207.50 → 3207.86] little,
[3208.06 → 3208.42] you know,
[3209.82 → 3210.26] fun to see.
[3210.78 → 3211.22] All right,
[3211.22 → 3211.36] sorry,
[3211.44 → 3212.10] I muted him.
[3212.32 → 3212.52] That's,
[3212.72 → 3213.24] we got it.
[3213.42 → 3214.00] This is,
[3214.52 → 3215.36] sorry,
[3215.70 → 3216.20] we're going to end
[3216.20 → 3217.10] the episode right here.
[3217.88 → 3218.94] We're going to just move up.
[3220.86 → 3222.16] So I have them both there.
[3222.16 → 3222.22] Prime,
[3222.26 → 3222.82] you're back now.
[3222.94 → 3223.24] You're back.
[3223.30 → 3223.76] They can hear you.
[3223.82 → 3225.10] I actually stun locked
[3225.10 → 3226.56] poor trash,
[3226.56 → 3227.04] like trash,
[3227.12 → 3227.46] just like,
[3227.56 → 3231.34] so I,
[3231.34 → 3231.66] I,
[3231.74 → 3232.74] I have to admit,
[3232.94 → 3235.64] my recollection was that pink,
[3235.84 → 3239.54] so jades are actually more,
[3239.72 → 3241.60] they're harder than pinks,
[3241.60 → 3242.62] was my recollection,
[3242.84 → 3244.12] meaning a jade is,
[3244.46 → 3245.38] has more,
[3245.38 → 3247.66] I don't know what you want
[3247.66 → 3247.96] to call that,
[3247.96 → 3248.48] but pressure,
[3248.68 → 3248.88] it was,
[3249.02 → 3249.12] yeah,
[3249.30 → 3249.58] grams,
[3249.68 → 3250.50] I don't know how grams
[3250.50 → 3251.08] work with pressures,
[3251.16 → 3251.92] but it says G's.
[3252.54 → 3253.32] I thought that,
[3253.46 → 3254.02] for some reason,
[3254.26 → 3256.14] my recollection was that jades
[3256.14 → 3257.38] were harder than pinks,
[3257.46 → 3258.06] but if they're,
[3258.16 → 3258.64] either way,
[3259.10 → 3260.98] I did try both of those,
[3261.06 → 3262.58] so I tried doing a whole
[3262.58 → 3263.96] keyboard jade,
[3264.22 → 3265.48] and a whole keyboard
[3265.48 → 3267.70] with the box pinks,
[3267.96 → 3268.12] both,
[3268.12 → 3268.58] both box,
[3268.58 → 3269.76] box jades and box pinks,
[3269.86 → 3272.68] and I found that both of them
[3272.68 → 3274.28] were too much for me.
[3274.28 → 3276.02] I didn't like having to push
[3276.02 → 3278.08] that hard on the switches.
[3278.64 → 3279.70] Separate from the clickiness,
[3279.92 → 3280.26] which I,
[3280.62 → 3280.76] you know,
[3280.80 → 3281.12] because I,
[3281.26 → 3281.60] like I said,
[3281.66 → 3282.28] I like the variety,
[3282.40 → 3282.80] sometimes I'm like,
[3282.86 → 3283.84] I might do cliquey for a little
[3283.84 → 3284.08] while,
[3284.22 → 3284.66] but you know,
[3284.74 → 3285.80] I tend to come back to silence,
[3285.94 → 3286.96] but I'll do it sometimes.
[3287.36 → 3288.78] I found it was too much.
[3289.78 → 3289.94] I,
[3290.34 → 3290.88] however,
[3292.02 → 3293.04] important caveat,
[3293.60 → 3294.76] when I built the keyboard
[3294.76 → 3295.60] for John,
[3296.20 → 3298.04] those were ceramic keycaps,
[3298.16 → 3299.52] and ceramic keycaps
[3299.52 → 3301.94] are extraordinarily heavy.
[3302.12 → 3302.54] Like,
[3302.54 → 3304.52] they are way heavier
[3304.52 → 3305.48] than the standard,
[3305.48 → 3305.94] like,
[3306.14 → 3307.46] plastic keycaps
[3307.46 → 3309.36] that we all typically use.
[3310.00 → 3311.04] And on those,
[3311.36 → 3312.72] I actually pretty much
[3312.72 → 3313.84] had to use,
[3314.30 → 3316.46] on the bigger keys,
[3316.82 → 3316.96] like,
[3317.06 → 3318.62] he usually likes blue switches,
[3318.78 → 3319.74] so I think I used
[3319.74 → 3321.28] a Patron Pro Blue,
[3321.68 → 3322.72] I don't remember exactly
[3322.72 → 3323.14] what the
[3323.30 → 3324.24] what switch was,
[3324.50 → 3325.64] it was a blue switch,
[3326.16 → 3327.52] but on the bigger keys,
[3327.74 → 3328.02] like,
[3328.02 → 3329.40] on the return key
[3329.40 → 3330.14] and the
[3330.18 → 3331.04] and the space bar
[3331.04 → 3331.84] and things like that,
[3332.00 → 3333.30] I had to use jades
[3333.30 → 3334.40] because it just,
[3334.54 → 3335.62] the blue could not
[3335.62 → 3336.54] hold the key up.
[3336.68 → 3338.22] It was too squishy feeling
[3338.22 → 3339.66] because they were so heavy.
[3339.76 → 3340.50] The space bar
[3340.50 → 3341.30] on those ceramics
[3341.30 → 3342.18] is so heavy.
[3342.56 → 3343.00] So,
[3343.16 → 3344.24] it does depend
[3344.24 → 3345.16] a little bit
[3345.16 → 3346.12] on what you're putting
[3346.12 → 3346.80] on top of it,
[3346.84 → 3347.22] I think,
[3347.30 → 3348.46] although presumably
[3348.46 → 3349.72] not as much
[3349.72 → 3350.14] if you don't,
[3350.20 → 3350.64] if you're not going
[3350.64 → 3351.30] something ridiculous
[3351.30 → 3352.52] like a ceramic keycap.
[3352.52 → 3353.66] But yeah,
[3353.74 → 3354.06] for me,
[3354.16 → 3354.46] I like,
[3354.56 → 3355.84] I don't like going
[3355.84 → 3356.74] for the jades
[3356.74 → 3357.56] or the box jades
[3357.56 → 3358.10] or box pinks,
[3358.12 → 3358.64] they were too much
[3358.64 → 3358.98] for me.
[3361.84 → 3362.20] Huh.
[3364.02 → 3364.38] Prime,
[3364.42 → 3364.94] I think you're,
[3365.02 → 3366.38] you're not min-maxing enough.
[3366.46 → 3366.88] I think we need
[3366.88 → 3367.38] to go back
[3367.38 → 3368.12] to the drawing board,
[3368.22 → 3368.78] we need to get
[3368.78 → 3370.32] per key
[3370.32 → 3371.26] different switches
[3371.26 → 3371.76] for you
[3371.76 → 3372.74] based on your
[3372.74 → 3373.54] finger strength
[3373.54 → 3374.62] and distance
[3374.62 → 3375.26] from home row.
[3375.44 → 3375.58] That's,
[3375.66 → 3376.14] I think like,
[3376.20 → 3377.32] you're not min-maxing
[3377.32 → 3377.80] enough right now.
[3377.80 → 3378.58] Does anyone sell
[3378.58 → 3379.52] an ergonomic keyboard
[3379.52 → 3380.90] with the swappable,
[3381.12 → 3381.98] with hot swappable?
[3382.52 → 3382.70] I think,
[3382.78 → 3383.54] I think when it comes
[3383.54 → 3384.06] to concavity,
[3384.16 → 3384.46] they're all,
[3384.58 → 3384.96] they're all
[3384.96 → 3386.06] non-hot swappable.
[3387.04 → 3388.38] I can understand why,
[3388.46 → 3389.02] but it's too bad
[3389.02 → 3389.72] because it would be nice
[3389.72 → 3390.28] if you could just,
[3390.42 → 3390.70] you know,
[3391.18 → 3391.50] tweak them.
[3391.64 → 3392.30] We could go on a
[3392.30 → 3393.18] we can go on a 3D
[3393.18 → 3393.82] printing arc.
[3394.38 → 3395.36] There could be a 3D
[3395.36 → 3396.04] printing arc here.
[3396.18 → 3396.60] You know,
[3396.70 → 3397.60] it would be kind of cool
[3397.60 → 3398.30] to be able to be like,
[3398.36 → 3398.44] hey,
[3398.46 → 3399.28] I 3D printed this
[3399.28 → 3399.84] and then I put,
[3400.62 → 3401.40] in the centre
[3401.40 → 3402.26] I have the heaviest
[3402.26 → 3402.90] because that's where
[3402.90 → 3403.24] I'm like,
[3403.30 → 3403.72] that's where I'm,
[3403.98 → 3404.22] you know,
[3404.26 → 3404.52] because I,
[3404.82 → 3405.32] because just like
[3405.32 → 3406.20] a professional boxer,
[3406.30 → 3406.96] like I don't aim
[3406.96 → 3407.64] to punch the front
[3407.64 → 3408.06] of the face,
[3408.10 → 3409.42] I aim to punch the back,
[3409.82 → 3410.04] right?
[3410.12 → 3410.62] And so when I,
[3410.74 → 3411.56] when I type,
[3411.80 → 3413.24] I'm not trying to hit the key,
[3413.36 → 3413.84] I'm trying to hit
[3413.84 → 3414.74] through the key.
[3415.22 → 3415.56] So I,
[3415.68 → 3417.22] I actually bent the metal.
[3417.38 → 3417.54] Yes,
[3417.54 → 3418.40] I bent the metal
[3418.40 → 3419.04] on a
[3419.10 → 3419.40] what's it called?
[3419.50 → 3421.20] My MacBook Pro
[3421.20 → 3421.72] when I used to use
[3421.72 → 3422.02] a MacBook
[3422.02 → 3422.68] because I would actually
[3422.68 → 3423.54] slap of the
[3423.54 → 3425.08] slap of the space bar
[3425.08 → 3425.84] so hard
[3425.84 → 3427.02] that there was a warp
[3427.02 → 3427.52] in the metal
[3427.52 → 3428.62] when I would type
[3428.62 → 3429.26] because I would just,
[3429.34 → 3430.48] I just love smashing it.
[3430.52 → 3431.66] I just smashed it.
[3431.66 → 3432.16] It's so hard.
[3432.16 → 3433.32] When I'm in the zone coding,
[3433.46 → 3434.84] I am pounding that keyboard.
[3434.84 → 3434.98] Yeah,
[3435.02 → 3435.14] dude,
[3435.24 → 3436.70] I have broken,
[3436.74 → 3437.36] I have broken
[3437.36 → 3438.36] multiple keyboards
[3438.36 → 3439.16] because I just take them
[3439.16 → 3439.68] to pound town
[3439.68 → 3440.72] every time.
[3441.22 → 3441.74] I'll be pounding.
[3442.04 → 3442.62] I'll be pounding.
[3442.90 → 3443.10] Yeah.
[3443.50 → 3443.92] Hell yeah,
[3444.00 → 3444.28] brother.
[3444.74 → 3445.44] Hell yeah.
[3446.36 → 3446.76] Well,
[3446.90 → 3447.24] you know,
[3447.32 → 3447.56] this,
[3447.72 → 3448.60] we were talking about
[3448.60 → 3449.52] terminal.shop,
[3449.62 → 3449.96] like what,
[3450.12 → 3451.24] where is the prime
[3451.24 → 3452.68] approved official
[3452.68 → 3453.86] 3D printed keyboard?
[3453.86 → 3454.18] Like,
[3454.24 → 3455.62] why is that not an item
[3455.62 → 3456.34] that can be ordered
[3456.34 → 3457.04] by the chat?
[3457.10 → 3458.74] Because I would hate
[3458.74 → 3460.50] to get into the business
[3460.50 → 3461.26] of printing keyboards.
[3461.58 → 3461.78] Yeah.
[3461.78 → 3462.02] Like,
[3462.08 → 3462.72] there's just no amount
[3462.72 → 3463.44] of money you could pay me
[3463.44 → 3463.74] to be like,
[3463.80 → 3463.92] hey,
[3463.94 → 3464.62] do you want to just like
[3464.62 → 3465.64] make keyboards for a living?
[3465.70 → 3465.92] It's like,
[3465.94 → 3466.04] no,
[3466.06 → 3466.88] I don't want to solder,
[3467.24 → 3467.58] print.
[3468.00 → 3468.20] Yeah.
[3469.46 → 3469.68] Yeah.
[3469.86 → 3470.40] Trust me,
[3470.52 → 3470.66] we,
[3470.90 → 3471.98] any product we make
[3471.98 → 3472.60] or sell,
[3472.74 → 3474.12] we are not having you
[3474.12 → 3474.88] be a critical piece
[3474.88 → 3475.44] of the pipeline
[3475.44 → 3476.36] of getting it from
[3476.36 → 3477.84] purchase to your customer.
[3478.54 → 3479.12] I would agree
[3479.12 → 3480.10] that the only person
[3480.10 → 3480.54] that needs to be
[3480.54 → 3481.30] a critical piece
[3481.30 → 3482.20] is somebody
[3482.20 → 3483.30] outside our company
[3483.30 → 3484.44] that that's all they do.
[3485.02 → 3485.38] Okay.
[3486.10 → 3486.56] We're on,
[3486.66 → 3487.50] I'm on that team.
[3488.26 → 3488.90] Fair enough.
[3489.70 → 3490.28] Why is everyone
[3490.28 → 3490.98] laughing at that?
[3490.98 → 3491.68] It's kind of a
[3491.78 → 3492.42] just a jerk move
[3492.42 → 3493.54] right there.
[3494.36 → 3494.76] Well,
[3494.80 → 3495.80] because it seemed
[3495.80 → 3496.78] like they were very,
[3496.98 → 3498.04] they were suggesting
[3498.04 → 3498.62] that somehow
[3498.62 → 3499.80] it would be unreliable
[3499.80 → 3501.38] if you were involved
[3501.38 → 3503.02] in producing anything
[3503.02 → 3503.72] from the pipeline.
[3503.72 → 3504.20] and I'm like,
[3504.26 → 3504.98] that was kind of,
[3505.06 → 3506.20] that was a bit of a backhand.
[3506.20 → 3506.36] I don't think anyone
[3506.36 → 3507.28] was thinking Prime
[3507.28 → 3508.46] was going to hand solder
[3508.46 → 3510.04] all the ones on the shop.
[3510.22 → 3511.12] That wasn't the
[3511.66 → 3513.06] we were saying just for you,
[3513.14 → 3513.92] you could make one.
[3514.16 → 3515.42] We could go on a 3D printing arc,
[3515.70 → 3516.42] but this is like,
[3516.48 → 3517.64] you guys will appreciate this.
[3518.10 → 3519.48] I got to tell him one story
[3519.48 → 3520.54] because I know that chat
[3520.54 → 3521.66] and trash in case
[3521.66 → 3522.44] you will appreciate this.
[3522.54 → 3523.82] When we were going to Miami,
[3523.82 → 3525.86] like a few days before,
[3526.20 → 3526.74] all of a sudden,
[3526.82 → 3528.20] Prime messages in Slack.
[3528.32 → 3528.68] He's like,
[3528.96 → 3529.64] hey guys,
[3530.02 → 3531.30] do we have an Airbnb?
[3531.54 → 3532.82] I could just go get one right now.
[3532.88 → 3533.04] No,
[3533.12 → 3533.84] I did not say that.
[3533.90 → 3534.22] I said,
[3534.74 → 3535.78] hey TJ,
[3536.02 → 3537.84] do you have an Airbnb?
[3538.98 → 3539.62] CC Dax,
[3539.66 → 3540.18] because I wasn't sure
[3540.18 → 3540.74] if Dax has already
[3540.74 → 3541.50] booked everything or not.
[3541.58 → 3542.64] So I actually did it that way.
[3542.66 → 3544.10] That was like a very concerned thing,
[3544.18 → 3545.44] like helping you TJ.
[3545.56 → 3546.12] Like I thought maybe
[3546.12 → 3546.76] we were on our own
[3546.76 → 3547.40] because last year
[3547.40 → 3548.56] we were on our own.
[3549.02 → 3549.76] So I'm out there like
[3549.76 → 3551.10] actually being a good friend
[3551.10 → 3551.84] and if I'm wrong,
[3551.96 → 3552.74] Dax will correct me.
[3553.10 → 3554.40] And so they made fun of me
[3554.40 → 3555.00] from there on out.
[3555.02 → 3555.60] Like I was going to book
[3555.60 → 3556.14] the whole house.
[3556.24 → 3556.42] No,
[3556.42 → 3559.02] I tagged TJ for that exact reason.
[3559.40 → 3561.36] I just liked the implication,
[3561.60 → 3561.80] one,
[3561.86 → 3563.26] that we were waiting on you
[3563.26 → 3564.24] to book the Airbnb.
[3565.48 → 3565.82] Well,
[3565.86 → 3566.54] that was the main thing
[3566.54 → 3566.96] that was correct.
[3567.00 → 3568.72] It was like within the week before.
[3569.14 → 3569.54] You know,
[3569.58 → 3569.82] Prime,
[3569.90 → 3571.40] you try to be a nice guy
[3571.40 → 3572.60] and this is what they do.
[3572.64 → 3572.82] Dude,
[3572.86 → 3573.08] I know.
[3573.10 → 3574.32] I got bust so hard
[3574.32 → 3575.98] for like for days.
[3576.10 → 3577.42] They made fun of me on that one.
[3577.42 → 3578.22] It was pretty funny.
[3578.86 → 3579.68] Where's the Airbnb,
[3580.02 → 3580.36] Prime?
[3580.70 → 3580.98] Dude,
[3581.06 → 3581.64] I was just like,
[3581.72 → 3581.84] dude,
[3581.84 → 3583.72] I literally reached out to TJ
[3583.72 → 3584.58] and then ensured
[3584.58 → 3586.52] that our team planning lead
[3586.52 → 3587.94] knew that I was talking about.
[3587.94 → 3588.22] To be fair,
[3588.90 → 3591.80] within one like screen page,
[3591.90 → 3592.82] like scrolling up,
[3593.04 → 3594.02] was the message
[3594.02 → 3595.22] with the reservation
[3595.22 → 3596.20] to the Airbnb.
[3596.74 → 3596.88] Okay,
[3596.94 → 3597.32] that's fair.
[3597.36 → 3597.72] That's fine.
[3597.80 → 3598.06] That's fine.
[3598.18 → 3598.40] That's fine.
[3598.92 → 3599.86] I don't read.
[3600.04 → 3601.28] He already said he doesn't know
[3601.28 → 3602.46] how to use the magic mouse
[3602.46 → 3603.06] to scroll up.
[3603.06 → 3603.26] True.
[3603.40 → 3604.90] He was not holding his mouse
[3604.90 → 3606.54] sideways and thumbing up.
[3606.54 → 3606.98] Yeah,
[3607.10 → 3608.16] I didn't have the reservation.
[3608.38 → 3608.68] Hold on.
[3608.80 → 3609.18] I got you.
[3609.82 → 3610.26] Jarvis?
[3610.56 → 3611.04] Jarvis,
[3611.16 → 3611.64] reservation.
[3612.08 → 3612.50] Reservation,
[3612.66 → 3612.84] please.
[3613.00 → 3614.00] Airbnb reservation.
[3614.00 → 3617.06] Siri?
[3617.50 → 3617.86] Siri?
[3619.52 → 3620.70] Do we have an Airbnb?
[3621.68 → 3622.06] Siri,
[3622.16 → 3622.76] where am I?
[3624.58 → 3625.88] This is not okay.
[3625.90 → 3626.34] I'm just going to bring this
[3626.34 → 3627.26] around with me all the time.
[3628.08 → 3628.46] It's part of it.
[3628.46 → 3628.76] All right.
[3629.10 → 3629.50] All right.
[3629.56 → 3629.66] Well,
[3629.66 → 3630.58] I think we need to end it there.
[3630.60 → 3631.04] I do.
[3631.18 → 3631.92] I agree with you guys.
[3631.92 → 3632.56] It needs to be over.
[3632.92 → 3633.92] It needs to be over.
[3634.42 → 3635.36] Ladies and gentlemen,
[3636.02 → 3638.02] if those of you at home
[3638.02 → 3640.30] are interested in keyboard stuff,
[3640.52 → 3642.68] I unfortunately highly recommend it.
[3642.76 → 3643.66] It's a lot of fun.
[3644.04 → 3645.26] But be prepared to waste
[3645.26 → 3646.36] way too much time on it
[3646.36 → 3647.28] if you get into it.
[3647.38 → 3648.84] That is all there is to say.
[3649.26 → 3650.96] Find the keyboard that's right for you,
[3651.06 → 3652.22] even if it involves
[3652.22 → 3653.50] hentai keycaps
[3653.50 → 3655.64] and whatever the heck else.
[3655.76 → 3656.22] I don't know.
[3657.12 → 3657.58] It's okay.
[3657.58 → 3658.64] If you're this far in the episode,
[3658.86 → 3660.08] you must love Casey a lot.
[3660.22 → 3660.92] Don't forget to check out
[3660.92 → 3661.54] Meow the Infinite
[3661.54 → 3662.70] and the Kickstarter for him.
[3662.90 → 3663.26] Whoa.
[3663.80 → 3664.04] Whoa.
[3664.04 → 3664.70] Oh my God, yes.
[3664.70 → 3665.46] Does anybody know this?
[3666.04 → 3666.36] Meow the Infinite.
[3666.36 → 3667.08] Yeah, we talked about it
[3667.08 → 3667.70] while you were gone.
[3668.10 → 3668.48] Oh, yes.
[3668.48 → 3669.14] If you do,
[3669.24 → 3670.52] our Kickstarter is live.
[3670.64 → 3671.96] If you are looking for

[3676.74 → 3677.80] it is all ages.

[3679.46 → 3680.28] Beautiful artwork.

[3683.38 → 3684.98] We got all kinds of great stuff on there.
[3685.50 → 3685.96] And yeah,
[3686.62 → 3688.38] thank you guys for letting me mention it,
[3688.46 → 3688.76] actually.
[3688.88 → 3689.90] We really appreciate it.
[3690.30 → 3690.56] Yeah.
[3690.84 → 3691.50] Very good.
[3692.10 → 3692.46] Very good.
[3692.56 → 3693.38] Trash, you got anything you do?
[3693.38 → 3694.10] I'm almost done with the second one.
[3694.18 → 3694.50] You got anything?
[3694.78 → 3695.26] I'm just kidding.
[3695.28 → 3696.10] He does, actually.
[3696.56 → 3697.24] Trash did.
[3697.54 → 3699.04] He's speaking at a conference
[3699.04 → 3699.78] that sounded cool.
[3700.72 → 3700.96] Yeah.
[3701.12 → 3701.86] His talk sounded cool.
[3701.88 → 3702.04] Really?
[3702.16 → 3702.68] What is it called?
[3703.02 → 3703.46] What is it called?
[3703.76 → 3705.18] I'm speaking at Render Atlanta.
[3705.36 → 3705.74] Oh, cool.
[3705.84 → 3706.44] So it must be,
[3706.52 → 3707.72] like I assume Render Atlanta
[3707.72 → 3709.22] must be about like using the canvas
[3709.22 → 3709.92] and cutting edge.
[3710.62 → 3711.36] Yeah, of course.
[3711.50 → 3711.72] Duh.
[3711.80 → 3712.20] For rendering.
[3712.50 → 3713.04] What is it about?
[3713.12 → 3713.56] Is that right?
[3713.62 → 3713.90] It is?
[3714.26 → 3715.14] What's the talk going to be on?
[3715.14 → 3716.40] It's just a huge tech conference
[3716.40 → 3717.72] in Atlanta.
[3717.96 → 3718.84] I don't think it's like specific
[3718.84 → 3720.24] to like rendering or anything.
[3720.44 → 3721.10] What's your talk?
[3721.14 → 3721.90] What's your talk going to be on?
[3721.98 → 3722.10] Yeah.
[3722.14 → 3722.56] What is it about?
[3722.96 → 3725.94] My talk is called WTF TypeScript
[3725.94 → 3726.92] and I'm going to go into
[3726.92 → 3729.06] all these weird, obscure things.
[3729.40 → 3731.14] Trash, run it back for us after.
[3731.44 → 3731.56] Yeah.
[3731.56 → 3732.28] On the standup.
[3732.40 → 3733.96] I want the WTF TypeScript.
[3734.46 → 3735.34] I want you to run that back for us.
[3735.58 → 3737.16] I'm like debating how many memes
[3737.16 → 3738.50] is too many memes for a talk
[3738.50 → 3740.18] because I'm like loading that boy up.
[3740.30 → 3741.12] So I don't know.
[3741.34 → 3742.84] Trash, we'll all set up a scene
[3742.84 → 3744.38] so it looks awesome live
[3744.38 → 3745.72] and we will be on the side
[3745.72 → 3746.40] like an audience
[3746.40 → 3748.82] and you should just run it for us.
[3748.84 → 3750.82] You can even do your test presentation on it
[3750.82 → 3751.80] so that way we can like
[3751.80 → 3752.96] correct anything you want,
[3753.04 → 3753.94] any live feedback.
[3754.60 → 3755.28] It'd be pretty sweet.
[3755.46 → 3756.22] I don't think it's stream.
[3756.32 → 3757.08] Is that what you're getting at?
[3757.74 → 3759.74] No, we're saying on here, Trash.
[3759.86 → 3760.88] Yeah, the standup.
[3761.12 → 3761.72] Like you do the standup.
[3761.72 → 3762.80] We want to hear your talk.
[3762.94 → 3763.90] Oh, it's not done.
[3764.04 → 3765.04] I'm not finishing it
[3765.04 → 3766.82] until like the day of the conference.
[3766.82 → 3768.98] That's what I said after.
[3769.30 → 3769.68] Don't worry.
[3769.78 → 3770.76] I was not going to make you
[3770.76 → 3771.98] get any good feedback.
[3772.30 → 3772.94] Okay, okay.
[3772.96 → 3773.46] Gotcha, gotcha.
[3773.66 → 3775.74] I think Prime was trying to be helpful
[3775.74 → 3777.02] and he was thinking that perhaps
[3777.02 → 3778.36] you had finished the lecture.
[3778.74 → 3780.36] I'm actually really stressed out
[3780.36 → 3781.94] because I've only done like,
[3782.06 → 3783.94] I've done small standup talks
[3783.94 → 3785.40] but for big ones,
[3785.44 → 3786.20] I've only done them virtually.
[3786.82 → 3788.30] So like if my jokes don't land,
[3788.38 → 3789.10] I'm going to know.
[3789.90 → 3790.94] Here's the terrible part.
[3790.94 → 3791.44] I'm going to go in
[3791.44 → 3792.56] and I'm going to be like,
[3792.68 → 3795.18] I'm literally going to melt into the stand.
[3796.04 → 3797.88] Trash, if you fly me out,
[3797.92 → 3799.34] I'll laugh really loud at your jokes.
[3800.14 → 3802.00] Oh, we could be plants in the audience.
[3802.00 → 3803.04] I was actually going to plant some laugh machines
[3803.04 → 3803.88] throughout the audience.
[3804.30 → 3806.12] So Trash, here's a little bit of a warning.
[3806.76 → 3808.14] Whenever you're doing a live talk,
[3808.26 → 3810.56] it's also sometimes hard to hear the audience.
[3811.04 → 3813.08] So you may be getting some like nice little chuckles
[3813.08 → 3814.50] like, that's pretty good,
[3814.56 → 3815.72] but you're not going to hear any of that.
[3815.78 → 3816.42] It's going to be quiet.
[3816.50 → 3818.40] So unless if they're rioting out in the audience,
[3818.50 → 3819.62] you're just not going to hear it.
[3819.62 → 3820.98] And so don't, you know.
[3821.50 → 3822.82] Well, if they're not rioting, I'm upset.
[3823.50 → 3823.86] Okay.
[3824.76 → 3825.84] Because it could be hitting home.
[3825.92 → 3827.60] It just may not be like belly laughing.
[3827.90 → 3830.02] I'll report back on one of the stand-ups all defeated.
[3830.52 → 3832.04] How are you doing out there, Atlanta?
[3832.88 → 3833.12] Yeah.
[3833.68 → 3834.00] Silence.
[3834.00 → 3836.48] I'm just going to start off by getting the city wrong.
[3836.86 → 3837.72] I swear, it's going to be great.
[3838.22 → 3840.24] Trash, start off with getting the city wrong.
[3840.74 → 3841.16] Oh, God.
[3841.28 → 3841.78] Yeah, that's okay.
[3842.02 → 3842.98] What's up, Alabama?
[3844.68 → 3846.48] I love how you said get the city wrong
[3846.48 → 3847.48] and then you said a state.
[3847.78 → 3848.70] TJ, that was beautiful.
[3849.00 → 3849.16] Yeah.
[3849.16 → 3850.22] That's what I'm saying.
[3850.38 → 3851.40] Like, it would be so good.
[3851.52 → 3853.24] I'm sure there's a city somewhere called Alabama.
[3853.78 → 3854.30] That's good.
[3856.02 → 3857.84] He was talking about Alabama, Wisconsin.
[3858.08 → 3858.90] Everyone knows that.
[3859.64 → 3860.26] All right.
[3860.74 → 3860.94] Bye.
[3861.94 → 3862.46] Bye.
[3862.46 → 3862.86] Bye.
[3863.12 → 3864.46] Bye, everybody.
[3865.30 → 3866.90] Great talk, everybody.
[3866.90 → 3868.08] Bo Tanner Holland.
[3868.20 → 3868.40] Bye.
[3878.68 → 3879.56] Bye.
[3879.56 → 3881.20] And living the dream.
[3881.38 → 3881.54] Bye.
[3881.56 → 3882.52] Bye.
[3883.28 → 3883.70] Bye.
[3883.84 → 3884.50] Bye.
[3884.52 → 3884.88] Bye.
