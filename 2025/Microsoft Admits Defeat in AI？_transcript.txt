[0.00 --> 7.56]  um i'll tell prime at the prime again hello it is time for stand up don't be late
[7.56 --> 13.54]  trash what you watching right now uh i'm watching fire force right now i'm kind of late on it i
[13.54 --> 18.48]  think they're like three or two seasons but it's really good because like when i watch dishes like
[18.48 --> 25.14]  i just need to like watch something i don't even like your literal zoomer brain i can't i can't
[25.14 --> 29.14]  even hear it because the water's so loud so i'm literally just reading the subtitles nice it's
[29.14 --> 33.58]  just like watching the animation i'm just like oh that's pretty good that is hey hi that's
[33.58 --> 40.52]  relatable though that part's true oh it's prime oh hey prime welcome to the stand up on today's
[40.52 --> 45.94]  episode we're going to be talking about clarna and other stuff can you can you make money off of other
[45.94 --> 51.32]  people forgetting to pay things and is microsoft actually open sourcing things or just still evil
[51.32 --> 59.12]  find out on today's pod tj that was beautiful tj this okay that was that's my job's
[59.12 --> 64.32]  can you stop well if it's your job explain the introduction of the last several episodes
[64.32 --> 71.98]  let me help out here ladies and gentlemen please put your hands together for today's podcast host
[71.98 --> 81.04]  the primogen hey great to be here thank you very much casey for that introduction but you know what
[81.04 --> 85.28]  really needs a good introduction is today's episode we're going to be talking about vs code
[85.28 --> 93.82]  why did they open source copilot what does it mean and a second topic of clarna yes should loads on
[93.82 --> 100.16]  burritos be a thing have we finally iterated to the final form of mankind or is there still room left
[100.16 --> 106.12]  to just get some extra money out we have two very serious topics to as you know we cover things very
[106.12 --> 112.70]  seriously here on the stand up uh we're trying to talk about vs code going open source i guess as the
[112.70 --> 117.34]  first topic but here's the thing copilot copilot of vs code going open source vs code is already
[117.34 --> 124.38]  open source right copilot and i would just like to say that i am going to sit here and watch because
[124.38 --> 130.90]  i have nothing to say about this so go go all right i have to say you have lost a this is about
[130.90 --> 138.48]  microsoft the company uh doing things okay he's gonna say he has nothing to say and then like he's
[138.48 --> 142.08]  gonna go on a 10 minute rant like yes five minutes later so it's fine it's fine that's right that's
[142.08 --> 147.06]  right after we say something stupid he can correct the record which would be very helpful yeah i don't
[147.06 --> 151.72]  know anything about vs code what do i know my computer is dying right now as we speak well that was
[151.72 --> 160.12]  trash that's a really solvable problem you should thanks for taking help just install arch linux no
[160.12 --> 166.52]  problem just start vacuuming dude everyone's favorite podcast guest was dax and so that's the that's the
[166.52 --> 174.14]  secret that's what you've been missing okay did you get the same headphones as dax he got the same
[174.14 --> 178.64]  ones as me okay all right i was about to say they're actually having the exact same headphones
[178.64 --> 184.46]  and i realized it right now but imagine people buying the same headphones you know this is mad
[184.46 --> 187.96]  these are these are built it kind of looks like you're trying to copy his swag right now too you're
[187.96 --> 194.02]  gonna start growing a beard yeah what are you bald i mean i've i've i am bald but i can't grow a beard
[194.02 --> 198.02]  so i'm pretty sad about that every time i try did i tell you this story we're about to go on a side
[198.02 --> 203.62]  rant hit us i i was working at an agency and i tried to grow my mustache out and i was going out for
[203.62 --> 211.38]  like a month and a half two months and my manager walks by my desk stops turns around walks up to me
[211.38 --> 217.56]  points at me and goes you should shave that and then i was like what the hell harsh
[217.56 --> 225.20]  that's called direct actionable feedback everyone asks their managers for that i think he was like
[225.20 --> 228.86]  from sweden or something so he had like the cool accent i don't what's a swedish pretty sound like
[228.86 --> 233.22]  you should you should shave that is that what they sound like i don't know yes that's what they sound
[233.22 --> 237.40]  like they sound just no trash one more time what was that like again i don't know i'm not gonna say
[237.40 --> 241.68]  it was a bruno he reminds me of bruno when they talk there you go but he said that i was like
[241.68 --> 248.46]  isn't bruno like super german isn't he like y'all you should shave it y'all yeah that's got to be
[248.46 --> 252.90]  some kind of title seven violation can you tell an employee to shave a mustache i don't even know
[252.90 --> 259.10]  yeah why not to be fair it looked terrible i looked like uh okay i think my my now wife said i look like
[259.10 --> 261.04]  a master shredder or something
[261.04 --> 263.54]  okay
[263.54 --> 265.72]  ninja turtle
[265.72 --> 268.14]  you know how he has like the food bitch
[268.14 --> 273.86]  so like i can i can grow the hair like long right here you look like a rat bro
[273.86 --> 279.48]  i know that's what i'm saying but like it can only grow right here and it's like always empty right
[279.48 --> 284.98]  here so it just like gets long and it just it's terrible tj by the way splinter would be the rat
[284.98 --> 289.54]  shredder would be the bad guy shredder has oh you're talking the bad guy master splinter
[289.54 --> 293.40]  yeah yeah because i knew he meant the rat was
[293.40 --> 298.30]  you wouldn't see any kind of mustache we were on the same page we were on the same page
[298.30 --> 303.10]  yeah i know you guys are on the same page but my autism does not allow such jokes to persist
[303.10 --> 307.28]  yeah so we were both wrong but in the same way trash i ever heard that and he was immediately like
[307.28 --> 308.52]  what are you talking about
[308.52 --> 314.86]  we have nothing to do with rats when he says master shredder okay yeah
[314.86 --> 319.48]  sorry sorry sorry okay she was talking about the rat though to be clear
[319.48 --> 324.40]  yeah i figured he got it okay got it can i tell you a little bit of a truth can i tell you just
[324.40 --> 329.30]  like a quick truth yes of course when he said master shredder i thought he was talking about the rat
[329.30 --> 337.32]  but instead i looked at chat and chat was like shredder okay okay there it is i actually had no idea
[337.32 --> 345.70]  i i knew that stolen valor prime stolen valor stolen it was so bad oh my goodness actually
[345.70 --> 351.00]  in between the different things you need to type into your arch install with someone telling you
[351.00 --> 356.12]  which teenage mutant ninja character it was yep yep yep i'm actually embarrassed i messed that up but
[356.12 --> 361.00]  anyways okay okay ho we should probably set the stage again join the world's biggest hackathon
[361.00 --> 365.92]  in the history of the world with over one million dollars in prizes
[365.92 --> 374.84]  oh that is a lot of yoga balls just visit hackathon.dev to enter obviously for senior devs only literally
[374.84 --> 378.90]  anyone can enter it could be your first app or your 1000
[378.90 --> 385.36]  uh what obviously me and prime won't be entering we're gonna be reacting to the award ceremony at the
[385.36 --> 391.94]  end of this hackathon did i build balls.yoga for nothing both of us are really excited to see what
[391.94 --> 399.84]  you build this month remember visit hackathon.dev for how to enter rules and restrictions obviously apply
[399.84 --> 407.72]  but seriously join the world's largest hackathon it's gonna be fun go to hackathon.dev for more
[407.72 --> 413.52]  details can you set the stage and then and then give your take all right yeah i'll set the stage
[413.52 --> 421.32]  i'll set the stage yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh anyways sorry i'm teach we've got
[421.32 --> 425.64]  casey we've got trash we've got prime here's our topic that we're going to start with discussing
[425.64 --> 434.98]  but of course we're leaving in trash's mustache story don't worry um so the s code uh recently decided
[434.98 --> 443.44]  to open source mit license too so like proper open source uh the copilot chat extension so
[443.44 --> 451.66]  that people could see that and also integrate new ai features into vs so my take on this they
[451.66 --> 457.06]  also open source a few other things like uh weasel like weasel yep and weasel too uh windows
[457.06 --> 462.68]  subsystem for linux for those who don't know what that means that's not a made-up thing like when we
[462.68 --> 472.26]  were saying like florbin smorgon the apple os mac os operating system extensions no weasel uh so
[472.26 --> 478.90]  my take is this is not microsoft saying that they love open source uh no surprise there i don't think
[478.90 --> 486.44]  that they do instead i'm very confident that this is microsoft declaring just absolute defeat and
[486.44 --> 492.32]  admitting defeat that they are unable to ship something that developers love and they need
[492.32 --> 497.34]  the community to do it for them they see the clear writing on the wall that they're getting absolutely
[497.34 --> 504.40]  mogged by cursor and windsurf literal forks of their own projects getting purchased for billions
[504.40 --> 509.96]  of dollars and they're on their own money with their own money with some of their own money
[509.96 --> 516.60]  they are buying a fork of their open source project that they own that they had a head start on
[516.60 --> 523.92]  and they are saying look at this we're getting mogged by a bunch of kids from san francisco
[523.92 --> 529.74]  what is happening we don't know how to win so instead they say we're gonna abuse our distribution
[529.74 --> 534.16]  we're gonna abuse our edge and we're going to open source this so that other people instead
[534.16 --> 538.24]  will integrate into vs code so that people can keep using it so that's my take
[538.24 --> 545.26]  why is that abuse though why is that abusing no no i mean abusing not like the actual like in the
[545.26 --> 549.96]  like game mechanics sense of like they're gonna take advantage yeah yeah yeah no like i think it's
[549.96 --> 556.88]  perfectly legal and fine for them to do it but i do think it's not some like suddenly they've decided
[556.88 --> 563.34]  in the ai space they love open source that's clearly not true otherwise they would be like working hard
[563.34 --> 571.10]  to try and make their core extensions like for c and for python available in other vs code forks
[571.10 --> 578.72]  but instead they actively license those away so that people can't and or just say oh there's a maintenance
[578.72 --> 585.42]  burden oh there's a maintenance burden you're microsoft dude you guys are the supposed to be the people that
[585.42 --> 590.88]  make stuff work from windows 98 and you can't figure out how to make your like little thing that you own
[590.88 --> 595.52]  the extension and the editor and everything else continue working in other forks no you are
[595.52 --> 602.08]  intentionally not prioritizing that work which is fine i don't think they like are obligated even
[602.08 --> 609.22]  morally to do so but like we can drop the act that microsoft actually like cares about open source can we
[609.22 --> 614.42]  just all stop pretending that part so there you go he doesn't care obviously they still have the python
[614.42 --> 620.14]  right the python lsp extension is still not open source they're still i i assume the c plus side is
[620.14 --> 626.16]  still not open source their c one is also not like open source and their python one prevents you from
[626.16 --> 630.88]  running it outside of microsoft projects like by license yeah yeah they're actually very clever so
[630.88 --> 636.46]  kind of the backup i i have some obvious disagreements with you but i or maybe some not so obvious
[636.46 --> 640.62]  disagreements but i will back up your case that they don't care about open source in the sense that they
[640.62 --> 646.62]  created lsp as an open source standard and then immediately released multiple closed source ones
[646.62 --> 652.78]  i think they later on uh open source their html one though i'm not certain on that but their html
[652.78 --> 659.00]  server i don't think or maybe it recently has become open source but they immediately went closed source
[659.00 --> 664.64]  and then got the community to make all the autocomplete open source like that's the reason why their editor
[664.64 --> 669.86]  i mean truly in my opinion it's why the editor became so popular and why bespoke languages were largely
[669.86 --> 676.04]  you know available to become popular were llvm plus lsp's like having those two combos allowed
[676.04 --> 680.24]  all these languages to flourish in a world that is very hard to flourish in and vs code is able to
[680.24 --> 685.76]  create something in which allowed a bunch of people to give them free labor and then they're just still
[685.76 --> 690.04]  riding off the top of it but i think microsoft i i this can i say i don't think it's actually about
[690.04 --> 695.62]  free labor i think just like internally structured they're unable to ship something useful like at the
[695.62 --> 700.74]  level of windsurf or cursor like i just think like it's not like they could they continue to pay
[700.74 --> 705.54]  people a lot of money i don't think it's about the money i think like to me it seems structurally
[705.54 --> 710.86]  they're incapable of shipping like a complete package that people are excited about so i don't
[710.86 --> 715.48]  what's the last microsoft i don't think they're incapable i don't think they're incapable i think
[715.48 --> 721.16]  the people who run vs code were running it since the days of github and their whole focus
[721.16 --> 726.36]  is that vs code is creating an environment for developers to work in and that really what they
[726.36 --> 730.72]  want them on is github they want them on these virtual environments where you run vs code in the
[730.72 --> 736.10]  cloud you want everything's in azure play it's all running towards that and when the world underneath
[736.10 --> 743.22]  them shift they got copilot because nat friedman was smart enough to observe that the world is changing
[743.22 --> 750.62]  and pushed github to make copilot he's no longer at github and they have not done anything good since
[750.62 --> 755.56]  he he effectively left you know like i actually truly think he was actually the real brains behind
[755.56 --> 759.34]  a lot of probably some good moves that they've done and they just haven't iterated i think it's
[759.34 --> 765.90]  just simply they didn't believe it was important can i can i insert a question here because i'm just
[765.90 --> 774.50]  again listening to what you guys are saying so is the idea you think that microsoft is wants the open
[774.50 --> 779.76]  source part because they want the community they want it to be developed that way they want people to
[779.76 --> 786.56]  adopt it but they are trying to retain enough control to ensure that those people who adopt it
[786.56 --> 792.00]  will then have to pay for microsoft cloud services is that is that what you're sort of implying the
[792.00 --> 796.26]  business model is or or i just want to make sure i understand what you're saying yeah or other microsoft
[796.26 --> 801.34]  like it doesn't have to literally be azure you know i'm saying like it can also be github enterprise
[801.34 --> 808.42]  tight integration right like the entire vertical stack of like microsoft products right right from
[808.42 --> 812.98]  where you're going to use microsoft languages you're going to use microsoft like hosting you're
[812.98 --> 818.62]  going to use microsoft cloud you're going to use microsoft ai right and if people are switching off
[818.62 --> 826.46]  of that into like cursor or something right or windsurf or whatever and then also using like claude
[826.46 --> 833.02]  inside of it microsoft's like oh that could be bad like that's our yeah you think that basically what
[833.02 --> 839.62]  they're they're right now trying to figure out what do we do to like push people and maybe keeping
[839.62 --> 843.44]  some things closed source is part of that is that like because like one of the things you're saying
[843.44 --> 848.82]  in closed source is like the python part of that or something and you think that's just because they
[848.82 --> 854.88]  need to retain some things that can't just be forked and cloned because if they don't they won't have
[854.88 --> 861.42]  any levers to pull to try and keep you on some kind of microsoft drip feed that you know where the
[861.42 --> 865.94]  money goes to them i'm just making sure i'm not just agreeing i'm just asking like is that what
[865.94 --> 870.70]  you mean i think that that was their idea they just didn't i mean to me it's just like they had
[870.70 --> 876.14]  the ability to execute and create a good editor i think the rest wouldn't actually have mattered
[876.14 --> 881.42]  nearly as much i think they could have open sourced all those things and people like obviously vs code
[881.42 --> 886.94]  like by all objective standards is a very successful text editor like out of all of them it's a very it's
[886.94 --> 892.16]  it's probably the most successful text editor to have ever existed and so it's not like they didn't
[892.16 --> 896.16]  have it's not like they're like oh my gosh we're worried about forks they could have made everything
[896.16 --> 899.76]  open source and it could have gone that way they just simply miss to me it seems like they've
[899.76 --> 904.54]  miscalculated the importance of ai and so now they're just going to try to make massive plays
[904.54 --> 911.22]  to effectively destroy cursor because my sneaking suspicion is that microsoft observes cursors observe
[911.22 --> 916.54]  these forks and realize that they completely leave open ai they could completely leave a lot of
[916.54 --> 921.42]  these things and slowly develop their own uh models that will eventually not need any of the products
[921.42 --> 927.28]  that microsoft either adjacently owns or directly owns and so i think they see it now as a threat
[927.28 --> 932.50]  that is how i look at it so they're attempting to beat them by beating them free so they're basically
[932.50 --> 938.56]  worried actually now we're gonna have these giant data centers filled with tons of blackwell gpus
[938.56 --> 944.18]  or whatever else we end up putting in there and no one will be using them because they'll be using
[944.18 --> 950.82]  our vs code but with somebody else's like ai plugin that use someone else's data center like google
[950.82 --> 957.56]  or whoever that's the idea that's the fear well i think they they're like i think prime we're pretty
[957.56 --> 963.56]  close to agreeing but like i i think there's like some differences or incapable mine is they're inept
[963.56 --> 968.18]  we like we we agree fundamentally it's just that you think they're incapable of doing it i think i don't
[968.18 --> 976.30]  know why if on the table is own every own all of developers like editor tooling that's on the table
[976.30 --> 981.72]  they're saying no we'd prefer not i just don't i literally don't think they have i think the people
[981.72 --> 990.82]  who are running vs code don't know how to program and they don't understand developers that's why they
[990.82 --> 995.12]  are able to i think it started off as developers making something for developers and they literally
[995.12 --> 1000.20]  just took vs or a visual studio which was a very successful product in of itself and so let's make
[1000.20 --> 1004.98]  it open for the web and that was very successful and then they never figured out anything else because
[1004.98 --> 1009.24]  they didn't they couldn't just draft off a product that already existed and so they're just like i guess
[1009.24 --> 1013.98]  this is what we're doing now and they never had another original idea afterwards and they just kept
[1013.98 --> 1019.94]  on just like resting on their laurels and so that's where i think the state of it is and so i don't think
[1019.94 --> 1025.24]  i think it's management but i i think we both agreed they're not doing it i made that tweet two
[1025.24 --> 1032.02]  weeks ago that said that that microsoft is incapable of competing against cursor and and here we are
[1032.02 --> 1037.06]  yeah so wait are you saying they are incapable i don't whatever i don't really want to argue the
[1037.06 --> 1041.32]  semantics of it like the thing that i wanted to say along casey's line and then trash i do want to hear
[1041.32 --> 1049.14]  uh like what you're saying is i i think if like in my in in my head i'm viewing the situation microsoft
[1049.14 --> 1055.92]  started with a closed source ai product and like compared to some of these other some of them closed
[1055.92 --> 1062.62]  some open source products like they've failed like i just don't hear it's to be fair it's maybe my bubble
[1062.62 --> 1069.40]  online or whatever but i never hear in the conversation of like ai tooling people talking about how often they
[1069.40 --> 1075.24]  use copilot and how much they love it now maybe that maybe they have usage numbers that are
[1075.24 --> 1080.54]  different or whatever that's fine but like i think they would have kept everything closed source if they
[1080.54 --> 1085.70]  felt like they could keep charging money for it and win like but i in my mind it's a cleared mission of
[1085.70 --> 1090.84]  defeat because they're they're not doing that same with any time and it's i don't think it's like uh
[1090.84 --> 1095.22]  some sort of like moral wrong like to have closed source software or whatever right like i think that's
[1095.22 --> 1098.56]  fine i think people should be able to make and sell whatever software they want if they want to be
[1098.56 --> 1101.94]  open source and free that's cool if they want to be closed source and not free also cool i don't
[1101.94 --> 1107.38]  really care but like microsoft is not they don't love open source in the sense they're not going to
[1107.38 --> 1113.50]  like do something that hurts their business i feel to like do an open source play so they are admitting
[1113.50 --> 1119.28]  defeat i think to these like forks uh and saying what we need instead is other people to come and
[1119.28 --> 1126.78]  integrate their ai stuff into vs code so that instead of having this fear where cursor's on a separate
[1126.78 --> 1133.34]  marketplace from microsoft that's what happens they have separate marketplaces uh to do the apps that
[1133.34 --> 1139.68]  means azure may not get a privileged spot or maybe it won't be as tightly integrated into the other parts
[1139.68 --> 1147.06]  of the stack for me that's where i see their fear has to be is that all of these microsoft land things
[1147.06 --> 1151.28]  like you usually don't pick microsoft something because it's like has this one product you love
[1151.28 --> 1157.02]  it's like oh well it's because they have the 35 things we can do all together ostensibly working
[1157.02 --> 1161.14]  together sometimes maybe not whatever but like that's at least what's supposed to be happening
[1161.14 --> 1166.98]  right and so cursor's on a separate plugin extension marketplace that's dangerous for microsoft
[1166.98 --> 1172.86]  i think that's like the point of vs code is to get you into the microsoft extensions so that's that's
[1172.86 --> 1176.76]  kind of where i'm at trash what do you think hold on actually i didn't realize they're on a separate
[1176.76 --> 1182.92]  plugin marketplace what is that so what happens to all the existing so say i'm like say i use vs code
[1182.92 --> 1188.72]  right now and i switch to cursor yep are they like completely just i guess like how do i use the same
[1188.72 --> 1195.20]  plugins so i'm pretty sure you can import stuff from vs so cursor there are uh currently ways that like
[1195.20 --> 1199.88]  people can publish to both marketplaces i think it's called like vtsx or something like that it's like
[1199.88 --> 1207.30]  the open uh vs code marketplace uh and you can run it in vs codium and other like more you could say
[1207.30 --> 1213.96]  properly open source uh like vs code forks or properly forked vs codes right in the sense that
[1213.96 --> 1219.90]  like it's no longer a microsoft uh product because and generally this is not a huge issue
[1219.90 --> 1228.26]  except if you like vs code to use different microsoft things because lots of those have licenses
[1228.26 --> 1234.86]  uh where they may only run inside of microsoft land things like the c extend some of the c extension
[1234.86 --> 1240.90]  things and some of like pilance for example and various other ones and i think microsoft probably
[1240.90 --> 1246.12]  has some other ways that they like for example copilot was using apis and other stuff that are not
[1246.12 --> 1251.94]  available in the extension marketplace like copilot was a blessed plugin because it's made by microsoft
[1251.94 --> 1258.24]  and they can i like cheat not in like the literal like legal sense but they can like cheat as developers
[1258.26 --> 1265.14]  by using apis that aren't available to other tools just like windows back in the day wow okay
[1265.14 --> 1270.14]  they're back to that huh oh yeah it's almost like it's the same game plan guys i'm not taking crazy
[1270.14 --> 1275.30]  pills i'm just recognizing the patterns um i may be taking crazy pills and recognizing the need to
[1275.30 --> 1280.36]  change this background to the today it's always sunny background i have one thing to add because i think
[1280.36 --> 1286.40]  you all pretty much hit everything like i am i do side with with t's like i do think well i don't think
[1286.40 --> 1290.90]  they're incapable i think they have definitely capable engineers what i think is oh yeah i think
[1290.90 --> 1295.00]  people are there are people skilled enough there to literally type the code to make it happen to like
[1295.00 --> 1299.28]  make something yeah well what i think is happening is they're kind of just being slowed down by the
[1299.28 --> 1303.76]  big machine that is microsoft um and that's kind of just slowing down their roadmap and they're just
[1303.76 --> 1308.54]  kind of held down by bureaucracy in my opinion and if you open source it obviously people can just
[1308.54 --> 1313.02]  work on stuff that aren't even like in your peripheral and like oh man that was a good idea maybe we can
[1313.02 --> 1317.82]  pivot to that and kind of um but then there's like the aspect of leveraging free labor i don't really
[1317.82 --> 1322.40]  think that's a part of it i actually think it's like the way engineers like kind of operate at least
[1322.40 --> 1326.62]  in my tech bubble is like oh it's open source their goodwill and they kind of get like brainwashed of
[1326.62 --> 1331.86]  like this is a good thing so i'm going to use them because you hear i hear every engineer say i use this
[1331.86 --> 1336.04]  tool because it's open source and that happens like nine times out of ten like if it's open source so
[1336.04 --> 1340.78]  like i'm gonna use that instead because there's transparency etc so i think that's like a part to kind of like skew
[1340.78 --> 1346.64]  some of that target audience to start using vs code i have used like the copilot integration i use cursor as well
[1346.64 --> 1353.68]  and yeah cursor is like hands down like way 10 times faster especially like on big tasks um so i can see like
[1353.68 --> 1359.34]  you know the reason to want to go to cursor and not use vs code and i'm sure they're seeing that
[1359.34 --> 1365.06]  obviously watching the market share kind of teeter-tattering and watching people paying money
[1365.06 --> 1371.70]  for these forks which is like the most hilarious thing to me um so yeah i don't know we'll see how it shakes out
[1371.70 --> 1376.94]  i was listening i was reading some research about it some some people from their team were kind of saying like
[1376.94 --> 1382.70]  they wanted they open source it because they wanted to standardize the ui they said the experiences were just so
[1382.70 --> 1391.06]  fragmented between cursor and vs code i don't actually believe that i think that was kind of just like you know they had to say something
[1391.06 --> 1397.06]  that's a good reason to open source to get separate editors with separate motivations to become the same ui
[1397.06 --> 1405.58]  if linux has taught us anything it's that open source leads to a very unified user interface across all the products
[1405.58 --> 1412.84]  all the different distributions there's just one version of linux there's just one version of all the ui is always the same
[1412.84 --> 1418.60]  it's always exactly the same you know you install ubuntu you install your arch everything whatever it is
[1418.60 --> 1424.04]  it's always exactly the same ui and that's the lesson same config also same everything you know
[1424.04 --> 1430.10]  it's beautiful i actually think like another part of this so when i did work in the government space a lot
[1430.10 --> 1435.94]  government is heavy u.s government specifically we're really heavy on microsoft tools um
[1435.94 --> 1442.66]  and uh i read somewhere like they needed to be transparent with their tools for some compliance reason
[1442.66 --> 1450.76]  i don't know how true that is but i can imagine you know dod or something would only allow their
[1450.76 --> 1456.38]  you know developers to work on such like high class products if there was some transparency on like
[1456.38 --> 1461.62]  what their ai integration is sending to the server right i think that's like the black box part
[1461.62 --> 1467.52]  and i feel like this is like definitely part of that play but i can't prove it but i think like
[1467.52 --> 1472.16]  obviously like the more transparent the easier or the more relaxed the government feels about using
[1472.16 --> 1476.78]  these tools so i also think that's going to be a big big play on their part okay can i ask another
[1476.78 --> 1482.74]  question of you guys well can i say one thing on trash's thing which they are not open sourcing the
[1482.74 --> 1489.16]  back end parts of co-pilot to be clear integration no no i know i'm just saying like yeah microsoft is
[1489.16 --> 1495.90]  clearly in my mind framing it like look we've open sourced our entire co-pilot stack like co-pilot i mean
[1495.90 --> 1499.94]  one you don't know which co-pilot they're talking about they've got 37 products named co-pilot so you never
[1499.94 --> 1504.54]  know which what they're actually talking about when they even the pc is called co-pilot yes right
[1504.54 --> 1509.16]  that's what i'm saying it's like you open source your whole os now and it's like no no no this this
[1509.16 --> 1514.12]  chat thing inside of an editor can you imagine what normies are thinking when the industry but anyways
[1514.12 --> 1521.32]  um it they're not open sourcing the back end part i thought they were saying oh there's no more secret
[1521.32 --> 1526.20]  sauce anymore it's all ai's got so much better we don't need the secrets okay open up open up the
[1526.20 --> 1531.96]  back end there's no secret sauce i think the big thing is that they realize that the i at least i
[1531.96 --> 1537.70]  personally think the money is in the integration it's not necessarily in the ai and the reason why
[1537.70 --> 1544.38]  i say that is that uh deep seek effectively just proved that you all if you have access to the
[1544.38 --> 1549.54]  hardware it's dramatically cheaper because you can just brain drain other ais like i just don't think
[1549.54 --> 1554.26]  it's nearly the same open moat that it used to be there used to be this wide moat where you could
[1554.26 --> 1559.20]  just be able to be like i have the best ai now people are like i just distilled your model now
[1559.20 --> 1562.90]  my model's as good as yours and here we go it's like all about the distribution it's all about the
[1562.90 --> 1567.14]  availability it's all about the speed and so that's where microsoft wants to compete and so they're
[1567.14 --> 1571.66]  like okay we're gonna let anybody integrate so we want to be looked at as the best because now you
[1571.66 --> 1577.00]  get to choose how it's done as opposed to being in this closed world cursor but really they i i just
[1577.00 --> 1581.88]  think that i mean i'm with tj pretty much 99 of the way i just think they don't care they don't care
[1581.88 --> 1587.34]  enough they had two choices which is they could get a whole bunch of talent and actually compete
[1587.34 --> 1592.60]  with cursor or windsurf on a real platform or b just give up the ghost and say we just don't care
[1592.60 --> 1596.86]  enough to do it and so that's where i think it's not incapable it's indifference maybe maybe indifference
[1596.86 --> 1602.20]  is a better word for me i would find i i would find that indifference a little hard to believe
[1602.20 --> 1609.90]  though because indifference would be like imagining that microsoft didn't have 1500 meetings about this
[1609.90 --> 1615.36]  where people were disagreeing or something like this didn't just happen like there was there was
[1615.36 --> 1620.30]  not indifference is like a something i would say they're committing a ton of engineer hours to making
[1620.30 --> 1626.40]  this happen like yeah they're gonna roll a bunch of stuff out of copilot chat into vs code core how
[1626.40 --> 1631.86]  many hours are they actually committing a thousand a month like that's just not indifferent that's what
[1631.86 --> 1635.10]  i'm saying right it's like it's such a drop in the bucket what they're actually committing
[1635.10 --> 1640.36]  like comparatively to what they have available to themselves like if they put 30 engineers on
[1640.36 --> 1648.78]  something that's they virtually put zero percent engineers on it okay yeah yes yeah it's not true
[1648.78 --> 1652.96]  really because it's gonna still cost them millions of dollars i think they'd rather have millions of
[1652.96 --> 1658.40]  dollars back or like they'd rather have the play where they own i think that someone wants to buy
[1658.40 --> 1662.10]  for 10 billion if something costs 10 million it's virtually nothing to them i mean yeah remember they
[1662.10 --> 1667.42]  made 25.8 i think billion net revenue after all operational expenses including engineers and
[1667.42 --> 1673.08]  everything so like they they make so much money when you say 25 million you're talking about what
[1673.08 --> 1682.36]  0.1 of the total net revenue which is what 0.01 of total revenue okay so i guess you're just saying
[1682.36 --> 1686.74]  microsoft doesn't like money like because i just don't say i think they don't i think they don't
[1686.74 --> 1691.22]  bend over to pick up 500 million dollars if there's like 500 million dollars on the ground they're like
[1691.22 --> 1695.42]  now we want to go over we want to go after like the 10 million they want azure to be a success
[1695.42 --> 1702.26]  because they look at amazon and see amazon being the i mean amazon aws makes amazon money if amazon
[1702.26 --> 1707.18]  did not have aws amazon would be out of business right now and so back to trash back to trash back
[1707.18 --> 1712.92]  he forgot he literally said he forgot to me you raise your hand technically i know and then i forgot
[1712.92 --> 1718.10]  no no i think i think prime said something about the money is in the integration yeah or something
[1718.10 --> 1721.16]  like that yeah money's in i think this is all about like compute because this is what you're
[1721.16 --> 1725.16]  paying for right so the more people you send to your servers that's where all the money is right
[1725.16 --> 1733.56]  i'd say yeah but i think um i think like for vs code like vs code does represent like a significant
[1733.56 --> 1740.56]  like investment from microsoft over many years and like as well as a serious part of their overall
[1740.56 --> 1749.94]  strategy like they care what happens to vs code i i guess they like it matters and they care too if
[1749.94 --> 1757.06]  like a bunch of 10 billion dollar companies get made running vs code forks and they can't capture any
[1757.06 --> 1766.80]  of that money like i i just don't i like i i don't really think that that like they want to prevent
[1766.80 --> 1771.94]  that from happening i think a play they have multiple options to prevent that from happening
[1771.94 --> 1777.20]  one option would be making vs code as good as cursor you're saying they could just put 3 000
[1777.20 --> 1783.22]  software developers on it and they wouldn't care so then i don't get why cursor does not have 3 000
[1783.22 --> 1786.52]  software developers they have nowhere close to 3 000 software developers i don't know how many they
[1786.52 --> 1791.68]  have but it's nowhere close to 3 000 so like are they capable or not you're saying like it would cost
[1791.68 --> 1798.88]  them nothing to just make cursor so i think so but they're choosing not to make cursor they're
[1798.88 --> 1802.82]  choosing to make it open source that other people can come integrate in their thing and they can keep
[1802.82 --> 1809.48]  people in the vs code ecosystem i'm saying that's because i think they can't do it otherwise why would
[1809.48 --> 1813.98]  they not i don't understand it's like i don't understand a very compelling argument here because
[1813.98 --> 1818.88]  yeah if especially if prime if your argument is that this money doesn't mean anything to them
[1818.88 --> 1825.42]  why can't they pay the 500 million dollars you don't think they'd bend over to pick up
[1825.42 --> 1832.56]  like why can't they just pay that money then to the same number of developers as cursor and have a
[1832.56 --> 1838.84]  cursor compete and i think a reasonably good answer to that question is institutional incompetence the
[1838.84 --> 1843.56]  same reason that a lot of things on microsoft are bad like why is the start menu a train wreck it's like
[1843.56 --> 1849.68]  it's not because they couldn't have the money to go pay someone who's ever programmed graphics before
[1849.68 --> 1855.70]  right or ui they could they could do that right they could go find someone you know they could go
[1855.70 --> 1860.78]  hire someone from some awesome looking game ui that was amazing it's like had all this crazy stuff
[1860.78 --> 1867.58]  they could hire those people but institutionally they don't have that ability right i don't know why
[1867.58 --> 1874.94]  i mean i've had interactions with microsoft so i i see some of the like facade of why but technically
[1874.94 --> 1881.14]  why like why can't they go spend half a billion dollars and get a great product i don't know right
[1881.14 --> 1886.90]  but they don't seem to be able to do that across any microsoft product like they seem to be very
[1886.90 --> 1893.88]  very incapable of that kind of motion and i you know obviously that tends to associate with company
[1893.88 --> 1897.72]  size it's what we think of when we talk about things being like ibm or something right you know
[1897.72 --> 1903.66]  but i don't actually know exactly what the pathology is but i i'm i'm kind of more with tj on this one i
[1903.66 --> 1907.70]  apologize i'm just i'm just more no that's fair it's fair you know you you may you guys may be
[1907.70 --> 1913.20]  correct maybe it truly is just incapability that's preventing them i i just have a hard time believing
[1913.20 --> 1919.00]  with a company of that size that there's not enough talented engineers that have enough voices to say
[1919.00 --> 1923.00]  hey we can do this we should definitely do this whereas that there's people that are just like
[1923.00 --> 1927.50]  actually just inept at their job it's not that they're incapable they just have stupid leadership
[1927.50 --> 1933.56]  in just the right locations they can't see you know the force for the trees that is a type of
[1933.56 --> 1938.98]  incapability right point right yes that is institutional incapability it doesn't mean that you have your
[1938.98 --> 1944.86]  individual developers if you picked certain ones and put them together and gave them the resources they
[1944.86 --> 1951.38]  need couldn't make cursor it means that institutionally you can't do that you don't have the ability to do
[1951.38 --> 1957.62]  that thing yeah that's that's the argument i'm making like i know someone like personally who like
[1957.62 --> 1966.10]  worked on vs code awesome engineer constantly cut out at the knees to like make improvements to lsp
[1966.10 --> 1972.24]  specification and other stuff like this and it was just like oh so i'm not saying i think there's a
[1972.24 --> 1976.20]  bunch of people that are way better software developers that work at microsoft than me like i think they're
[1976.20 --> 1981.00]  way better software developers and there's some of them who's like insane like the guy who made
[1981.00 --> 1986.06]  pyrite eric trout who like retired a little bit ago and everything but like dude this dude wrote an
[1986.06 --> 1990.36]  entire python thing all by himself you look at the commit history it's just him it's powering all of
[1990.36 --> 1995.00]  microsoft's like python ecosystem it's just like one dude and you know obviously some other people
[1995.00 --> 1998.48]  helped and everything but like you can go look at the commit history and you can just go see so like
[1998.48 --> 2004.38]  and it's like that dude's a thousand times better software developer than i am he's so cool he's like one of my
[2004.38 --> 2009.56]  software developer icons but it's like but okay but then so then why didn't they just say yo eric do
[2009.56 --> 2015.28]  you want to go build cursor like they just i'm saying they can't as a company not like that the
[2015.28 --> 2019.36]  people there okay i mean that's literally what i said with like the bureaucracy thing right like yeah
[2019.36 --> 2025.42]  what what if it's a 40 chess move though like because they somehow won the editor okay so they're
[2025.42 --> 2030.88]  incapable of making decisions i 10 years ago they were just as incapable of making decisions as they are
[2030.88 --> 2035.46]  today if they've made plenty of good decisions do you think there is a world that exists where
[2035.46 --> 2041.60]  they're actually still making really good decisions we just don't understand it i think that i think the
[2041.60 --> 2047.06]  decision to open source copilot chat is a very smart decision by them given the constraints that they
[2047.06 --> 2052.90]  have and clearly they have a bunch of smart people both who are probably convinced internally that
[2052.90 --> 2057.04]  microsoft is doing this because they love open source like i don't think a lot of people they have on
[2057.04 --> 2064.24]  like vr campaigns are lying you know it's like i think they're probably like excited that they get
[2064.24 --> 2068.90]  to open source their work and that they think it's going to be in that win for people and possibly like
[2068.90 --> 2075.72]  it will be in that win for people like i think open sourcing it is a smart move i think they literally
[2075.72 --> 2081.18]  i'm saying my perspective is if i'm sitting inside of microsoft and i'm somewhere up the chain and i'm
[2081.18 --> 2086.98]  looking around and i'm seeing cursor and windsurf and all these other guys and i'm saying we were
[2086.98 --> 2092.96]  first how are we not here and all i hear back is well we're don't worry in q3 we're also releasing an
[2092.96 --> 2098.18]  agentic drop down you'll be able to select your model too it's just going to be q3 and you're like
[2098.18 --> 2107.78]  q3 we need to go faster so then the so the option given the constraints that's really smart is let's
[2107.78 --> 2111.90]  open source let's let a bunch of other people do a bunch of things inside of here integrate their
[2111.90 --> 2117.44]  companies inside of our product and be inside of our ecosystem and we'll continue to embrace them
[2117.44 --> 2121.68]  we'll allow them to extend we're not going to talk about what happens next
[2121.68 --> 2126.84]  so do you think the amp i'm sorry go ahead no you can go ahead on this one i've been i've been i've
[2126.84 --> 2131.92]  been yapping a lot there's sort of the uh the old amazon principle i don't know if they do this
[2131.92 --> 2137.18]  still but uh in the old days they used to kind of have this idea where you would have multiple teams
[2137.18 --> 2141.70]  doing the same thing and you'd pick whichever one worked which i always thought was extremely smart
[2141.70 --> 2146.04]  because i'm like that's what actually that's what you actually need because even if we handpick some
[2146.04 --> 2150.02]  engineers they still just might not come up with the right thing for whatever reasons even if they're
[2150.02 --> 2154.84]  all very good right everyone who's ever programmed knows sometimes things come out sometimes they don't
[2154.84 --> 2160.72]  you make some bad decisions whatever right and so i think like the other problem could be inside
[2160.72 --> 2166.20]  microsoft as far as i know they still kind of have the mentality that like someone's gonna own this
[2166.20 --> 2172.42]  thing like this is the group that's doing the the you know the start menu now we don't have 10 groups
[2172.42 --> 2177.40]  that all do start menus then pick the one that's best so the other thing is like well cursor windsurf
[2177.40 --> 2182.10]  whatever you know microsoft may have been on equal footing for whatever they were making and theirs just
[2182.10 --> 2187.20]  didn't pan out as well just for random chance or whatever else and they didn't have other ones right
[2187.20 --> 2192.02]  so sometimes you just have to go like all right if we're not going to embrace that entropy if we're not
[2192.02 --> 2196.44]  going to embrace the multiple die rolls that we need then we have to figure out a way to just accept
[2196.44 --> 2201.74]  that someone external is probably much of the time going to be the people who do this do this better
[2201.74 --> 2205.54]  and we have to buy them or have them integrate with us or we have to have some other strategy
[2205.54 --> 2209.34]  so that could it could be that too right microsoft is awesome at making platforms
[2209.34 --> 2216.52]  whoa you mean like 30 years ago i mean in terms of turning their platforms into making money not
[2216.52 --> 2221.56]  delightful user experience i was like whoa we went off the rails quick
[2221.56 --> 2233.98]  yeah but right i was okay i know i will never be nearly as successful as microsoft right or like a
[2233.98 --> 2240.86]  bunch of people own it what like in the vertical yeah that sucks tj well all right we're almost there
[2240.86 --> 2246.26]  check out ssh shervil.coffee we're transforming terminal based e-commerce boys
[2246.26 --> 2254.04]  if you're in a select few places in the world where we currently can ship you could buy coffee from
[2254.04 --> 2260.30]  us um but like i mean so that's what i'm saying like i feel like microsoft bread and butter is not
[2260.30 --> 2266.46]  pleasing users it's building platforms that they make money from and other people are forced to use
[2266.46 --> 2271.18]  is that is that not what they is that not how they're making 25 billion a quarter or a year
[2271.18 --> 2275.42]  whatever quarter yeah yeah yeah net quarter um okay okay so i guess the follow-up question is do you
[2275.42 --> 2282.42]  think microsoft will do the final e right because they are embracing they are extending and using the
[2282.42 --> 2288.62]  ecosystem and their own power to extend their editor into the next levels will they then either
[2288.62 --> 2294.16]  extinguish by making the most successful product or will they actually just purchase out like does
[2294.16 --> 2298.88]  does microsoft have a history of purchasing out good ideas or do they just extinguish the ideas
[2298.88 --> 2301.20]  yeah so trash any blockers
[2301.20 --> 2309.04]  prime made me drop just eating prime made me drop is the most child answer i've ever seen in my lifetime
[2309.04 --> 2314.50]  i'm wearing all black and i dropped a cheese ball and it just rolled down my shirt down my legs i have
[2314.50 --> 2320.38]  like a cheese trail prime just like him drop a cheese ball that's crazy considering i'm thousands of miles
[2320.38 --> 2326.54]  away from you prime prime made me mute my mic and then i dropped my cheese ball so i'm a little upset
[2326.54 --> 2331.66]  okay to answer your question seriously i just want to get trash in on the mix again of course
[2331.66 --> 2338.48]  um i think so i guess i don't know because i have a i have a really hard time predicting anything
[2338.48 --> 2346.58]  that's going to happen in like the ai space i think it's very it's very surprising what happens all the
[2346.58 --> 2350.86]  time like i don't know is google gonna win now they just released a bunch of stuff and all i've
[2350.86 --> 2357.42]  been seeing is like crazy video generation from google like for the past two days from google io
[2357.42 --> 2362.58]  you're like i don't know are they are they gonna win i have no idea i'm just my broader point is more
[2362.58 --> 2368.50]  like i think if microsoft can extinguish the competition through this method then they will do so
[2368.50 --> 2375.06]  if that means that they're gonna there's some new ai mode of editing that comes in the next year
[2375.06 --> 2380.60]  whatever that could be there's like oh we develop this way that we can hook up into your brain to do
[2380.60 --> 2385.64]  it or something i don't know what the next step would be then microsoft will first try to make that
[2385.64 --> 2392.28]  available only to the copilot extension without open sourcing it into vs code proper so that they
[2392.28 --> 2398.62]  could capture that completely for themselves and if not then they will do the same thing here where
[2398.62 --> 2403.06]  they will open source that and hope that people build the integrations into their editor so they can
[2403.06 --> 2408.36]  continue being a platform that like the majority of software developers use i don't even know i don't
[2408.36 --> 2413.64]  know what the like actual number yeah is stack overflow is kind of a lie it's a bit of a bias
[2413.64 --> 2421.72]  audience right there yeah um so like that's so that's where like i think they are and that's why
[2421.72 --> 2425.78]  i'm saying like this move is an admission of defeat because otherwise they would have extinguished
[2425.78 --> 2433.66]  the vs core vs code like fork competitors right by doing something inside of vs code that was not
[2433.66 --> 2441.22]  available i hate you trash i could have had decks i don't know why we let you back on i'm loving it
[2441.22 --> 2449.68]  personally so there you go that's so i think if they could acquire i mean my understanding is like
[2449.68 --> 2457.20]  open ai attempted to acquire cursor and cursor said like either no or they wanted more money than open
[2457.20 --> 2461.02]  a wanted to do and then they went to go get windsurf instead i don't know if that's true or not this is
[2461.02 --> 2470.80]  what i read on x the everything application um so your mileage may vary on that one can i ask a question
[2470.80 --> 2478.76]  before he moved on to clarna yeah yeah uh my my question for those of us who literally don't care
[2478.76 --> 2483.42]  about any of this who may be some of the small very small percentage of the audience and me
[2483.42 --> 2493.60]  what is so when you use something like cursor what is cheese puffs what is what is a cheese trail
[2493.60 --> 2502.12]  i'm like starving i had to eat i had to eat now i'm good now i'm ready flat let's clap um what is
[2502.12 --> 2510.94]  the actual revenue model end game for cursor so when you use cursor what are exactly you're paying for
[2510.94 --> 2516.52]  is it just how you know based on your ai usage it goes to their cloud well whoever's cloud they're
[2516.52 --> 2521.94]  running on and they charge you a markup on that compute and that's what you're paying for do you pay
[2521.94 --> 2526.52]  like is that the entirety of the economic model or is there more to it could you just give me
[2526.52 --> 2531.34]  give me something for those of us who don't care go teach but want to understand okay my my
[2531.34 --> 2540.46]  understanding generally speaking there's currently i would say two major like money strategies in the
[2540.46 --> 2548.14]  editor space there would be one is a fixed rate uh like with different tiers of like here's you're
[2548.14 --> 2554.96]  going to get this many like basically like high priority large model big kind of queries blah blah
[2554.96 --> 2559.06]  blah they're going to prorate that to make sure that like on average they're going to make money
[2559.06 --> 2563.92]  they're going to try and figure out ways to like reserve big compute clusters in advance to like
[2563.92 --> 2569.10]  bring that price way lower than like you would be able to do on your own maybe like oh it's going
[2569.10 --> 2573.82]  to cost me 25 cents to run this query it costs them three cents because they've pre-reserved these
[2573.82 --> 2579.74]  blah blah blah and so they provide this like bundled subscription experience that like probably
[2579.74 --> 2583.78]  ideally gets paid by your employer so you don't have to think about it and you're just like it's
[2583.78 --> 2590.16]  a requirement for me to work here i have to have cursor pro plus experience enterprise edition right
[2590.16 --> 2594.66]  so there's like a head whether you use it or not it's like we're gonna pay an extra thousand dollars
[2594.66 --> 2599.32]  every week for every employee for all this compute or something but that's just what's gonna happen
[2599.32 --> 2604.62]  okay and then there's and like you see this with inside of cursor and like sort of as an alternative
[2604.62 --> 2613.44]  one that's like almost purely just usage based where they say hey um maybe they have some like free
[2613.44 --> 2618.88]  tier with small models they can run very cheaply you know no matter what you could not if you're
[2618.88 --> 2622.62]  running 24 7 for the whole month you wouldn't be able to you know cost them more than like 10
[2622.62 --> 2628.78]  dollars or something like that right um and then to do large queries you pay like an additional
[2628.78 --> 2635.22]  on demand kind of thing to say like hey this is going to be like 13 cents to run this one and
[2635.22 --> 2641.00]  then like you spin that up with tokens so like for example i've been playing with uh open code which is
[2641.00 --> 2646.16]  just like a more of like like a clod code kind of thing clod code does the same exact thing just runs
[2646.16 --> 2653.74]  in your terminal you pay by the token and that's it right and there's probably some either markup you
[2653.74 --> 2659.72]  would do if your cursor or somebody else i'm assuming or it's still cheaper than what you'd
[2659.72 --> 2666.22]  be able to get buying as a like individual person but like they're gonna have some markup over their
[2666.22 --> 2670.18]  costs but they can bundle up all the costs and do all this other stuff to try and make running the
[2670.18 --> 2675.30]  model cheaper than than you'd be able to so those i think are the two main like ways that you see
[2675.30 --> 2680.44]  like the pricing strategy for these editors going because most of them are not
[2680.44 --> 2688.26]  like not integrated in some other way like microsoft is as like a platform right you you
[2688.26 --> 2694.98]  you probably will see other ones doing things like these wouldn't be the vs code forks probably they
[2694.98 --> 2701.38]  would be some other thing but like hey easy deploy to our platform super deeply integrated to like our
[2701.38 --> 2706.50]  stack right so you might pay some like monthly subscription fee the additional benefit is like oh
[2706.50 --> 2712.02]  deploy instantly with this button it also know how knows how to talk to stripe or it also can like
[2712.02 --> 2720.16]  uh we preload it with all the latest react stuff and it's like perfect for doing your thing or whatever
[2720.16 --> 2727.68]  right um i even saw one recently for like elixir that was the guy who made phoenix i think or one of the
[2727.68 --> 2732.46]  guys who made phoenix yep right and he just built one that's like this one's for building phoenix apps
[2732.46 --> 2739.54]  i'll see you trash trash oh my gosh okay well this ruins the live experience thanks trash it improves it
[2739.54 --> 2746.68]  yeah back oh there we go oh that's cool thanks trash so that's the other option too i think casey
[2746.68 --> 2752.30]  is some of them may be able to go much closer to at cost if they have some other platform experience
[2752.30 --> 2757.56]  that they're trying to like build off of or integrate um with like the editor thing okay this
[2757.56 --> 2762.26]  is probably the oh sorry prime go ahead i was gonna say that that can i just say that in a bit more
[2762.26 --> 2770.32]  simple of a way yeah uh effectively they pay x for usage and they want you to pay y where y is
[2770.32 --> 2776.40]  some c of x that's larger than one that's effectively how they make money and their goal is that you don't
[2776.40 --> 2781.64]  use as much maximally because most people don't program they they have it all priced in they're probably
[2781.64 --> 2785.14]  gonna and my assumption is that down the road they'll have their own models they're probably
[2785.14 --> 2789.88]  already researching their own models such that they can do a lot of these smaller things themselves
[2789.88 --> 2795.26]  save even further money and their goal is just to shave money off just like people who make stuff on
[2795.26 --> 2801.68]  top of aws they make money on a per request style model or on some sort of group of request model and
[2801.68 --> 2807.62]  they get a reduced price so it's just a reseller with bulk purchasing is as far as i can tell but i'm sure
[2807.62 --> 2810.16]  there's other things that i'm missing and there's future plans that i'm missing
[2810.16 --> 2817.40]  and at the risk of asking a sort of question that maybe this is the wrong audience to ask but
[2817.40 --> 2823.46]  what happens when the models just run locally
[2823.46 --> 2829.74]  you don't have the integration so that's why i said i think the agents or the integration is where
[2829.74 --> 2833.70]  all the money's at is it's not just running the models i think it's there's going to come a point
[2833.70 --> 2836.30]  where a lot of these models are going to be more and more available i think they're going to make
[2836.30 --> 2840.10]  better and better improvements on how to make these things more efficient and you'll be able to run
[2840.10 --> 2844.10]  it on more and more consumer hardware assuming hardware also improves you know like there's
[2844.10 --> 2847.94]  going to come a point where you can run pretty powerful models locally i i think that where
[2847.94 --> 2851.72]  it's going to come down to is who has the best integration because we can all agree that if you
[2851.72 --> 2858.22]  had to go to chadgpt.com paste in the files you want get the answer out take that the five
[2858.22 --> 2862.88]  different sections of code and repaste it back into your editor that's a horrible experience
[2862.88 --> 2867.56]  comparatively to being able to be like hey cursor here's my question take that file take that file
[2867.56 --> 2872.32]  take that file take that file and it just goes and does it right like that's a real and so my
[2872.32 --> 2877.20]  guess is that the integration is going to be a much bigger win and if they don't allow you to use it
[2877.20 --> 2881.02]  or if they allow you to use it but you have to use it with your own models but you still have to pay
[2881.02 --> 2885.42]  a monthly fee to use their integration then i think that that's where it's going to be at i think
[2885.42 --> 2890.48]  what does the phrase integration mean in this case from the when i say that i mean from the ai to
[2890.48 --> 2895.28]  the thing you use to make something yeah so no matter what that is be usage based anymore there
[2895.28 --> 2900.26]  is my point right so it's if that would have to just be like you use it based like like microsoft
[2900.26 --> 2904.70]  or like like visual studios visual studios is just like a yearly subscription same with intellij
[2904.70 --> 2909.50]  right like you could imagine a world where these things if when or if it becomes ubiquitous that
[2909.50 --> 2913.88]  everybody runs their own models then i could imagine a world like intellij where it's like hey you want
[2913.88 --> 2919.90]  to use this nice thing it costs 20 bucks a year for you to use this much better editor i would say too
[2919.90 --> 2928.68]  the other thing is um you're still gonna have the problem of like you're using a macbook somewhere
[2928.68 --> 2935.74]  how are you gonna load in the latest gpu and the biggest model yeah so someone still like is gonna
[2935.74 --> 2940.50]  need to run the model somewhere right like even with the best like olama advancements or whatever
[2940.50 --> 2946.48]  it's still gonna be less than a huge stack of gpus right so you're still gonna have some cases where
[2946.48 --> 2952.42]  you're gonna want to outsource i think large requests assuming that in five years we still
[2952.42 --> 2958.30]  think llms are good for doing like coding tasks or whatever right but like assuming that's true
[2958.30 --> 2965.24]  you still like a lot of times probably want some thin client to your actual gpu farm right and like
[2965.24 --> 2970.18]  in that case i still think uh you're gonna want to at least for some of your requests or some of the
[2970.18 --> 2976.42]  things you're doing probably end up paying someone else to run that for you um and yeah i think like
[2976.42 --> 2981.82]  prime is saying i think like people pay for editors sometimes anyways but that market's way less than
[2981.82 --> 2990.56]  yeah yeah then then like uh getting everybody to spend 250 a month on your yeah i feel like there's
[2990.56 --> 2995.36]  a lot of risk here that's not really being priced in and the other thing i would point out is what you
[2995.36 --> 2999.80]  just said tj where you're like well you're still gonna have to you know for these bigger ones room
[2999.80 --> 3003.96]  full of gpus or whatever that's really not a business model that works either though because
[3003.96 --> 3011.40]  you can't have a business that's based on selling people something at a fairly low or reasonable cost
[3011.40 --> 3016.54]  that requires that much gpus i mean you've seen this over and over again where people try to do
[3016.54 --> 3023.16]  games in the cloud and they can't make it economically viable because you're like well like it would cost as
[3023.16 --> 3027.78]  much as if you bought that pc and here you're talking about a ton like you'd have to have more
[3027.78 --> 3032.64]  than one gpu to make this cost effective right i mean to make this more powerful or significantly more
[3032.64 --> 3037.76]  powerful a lot of times so i don't know like it feels like they're if that was really where they
[3037.76 --> 3041.52]  were headed i think they might be in a lot of trouble whereas if it's just like look this is going
[3041.52 --> 3046.78]  to be a simple sass thing we charge developers for you know a certain amount every year that seems
[3046.78 --> 3053.02]  stable but not a huge business necessarily right so i don't know i i don't think that's i i i just
[3053.02 --> 3057.70]  generally disagree with you on that one i think that they can make the money uh that gpus large
[3057.70 --> 3063.44]  scale gpus i think games are fundamentally different because running a game is like if
[3063.44 --> 3070.76]  you played one round of apex legend just one on a cloud gpu how what what is the equalized amount
[3070.76 --> 3075.82]  of queries that thing had just made is that a full day's worth of queries that that thing just made
[3075.82 --> 3081.74]  playing apex legends in just 20 minutes of a game versus a whole day of just playing non-stop
[3081.74 --> 3087.18]  uh llm queries like there i think that fundamentally you use a lot more gpu with games
[3087.18 --> 3092.32]  and even games they're i mean netflix is doing its own venture into cloud gaming and they're
[3092.32 --> 3095.74]  becoming a bit of a success because they're not doing triple a they're doing a different kind
[3095.74 --> 3101.02]  of game they're doing you know double you know not these huge massive 3d worlds and so there is a
[3101.02 --> 3106.32]  world that does exist where it does work out and and real time or server side render stuff does fully
[3106.32 --> 3110.42]  work out and we already do that right now with just say websites websites are already server
[3110.42 --> 3113.42]  rendered even though we should render them on clients you don't you can use a lot less hardware
[3113.42 --> 3117.14]  if you did that but we realize all these types of gains so i assume it's still going to exist
[3117.14 --> 3122.40]  that the big models the big things the big wins are the super secret sauces like cursors tab complete
[3122.40 --> 3127.06]  is obviously better than everybody else's they're not going to be like yeah we'll just like we'll just
[3127.06 --> 3131.06]  make it open source and everyone can just use it no it's like their secret sauce and obviously
[3131.06 --> 3136.10]  running it must not be that expensive because they continue to offer for everybody so they must cover
[3136.10 --> 3141.04]  their costs or they hope for one day to cover their costs which you know maybe that's uh maybe
[3141.04 --> 3144.72]  that's where the danger is but i just somehow doubt that it's a one day to cover the cost and they are
[3144.72 --> 3149.78]  actually just covering their costs well the only two things i'd say there is like well okay that
[3149.78 --> 3153.46]  assumes that no one else could come up with a secret sauce right because otherwise they could and then
[3153.46 --> 3160.30]  just run the secret sauce locally but assuming that uh that were true like sure if you can keep the
[3160.30 --> 3165.04]  thing hidden on the cloud so that no one else can access it then you may just be able to charge for the
[3165.04 --> 3169.14]  cloud service because people can't run it locally because you don't let them but the thing i was going
[3169.14 --> 3175.30]  to say about the the games versus uh deep learning stuff the problem though is that in order for the
[3175.30 --> 3181.82]  gpu to be doing meaningfully more than you could have done locally right because you're talking about
[3181.82 --> 3186.24]  something that now you're saying you have to run in the cloud because we need that much compute to
[3186.24 --> 3192.34]  process this query that has to be something that would require like many gpus or something it's not going
[3192.34 --> 3196.82]  to be something that just requires one gpu yeah so i don't know like again you're counting on those
[3196.82 --> 3201.40]  economics to work out in your favor and i don't know that they necessarily do right and you also
[3201.40 --> 3206.44]  have to count on you updating those gpus because if you're just going to leave them sit and five years
[3206.44 --> 3212.44]  down the road well everyone's now got a much better laptop with much more tpus in it and so your data
[3212.44 --> 3218.90]  center is falling behind and that capital cost goes up right so i'm not saying that i would place a bet
[3218.90 --> 3224.10]  either way you could very well be right but it's also like i don't know about those economics and
[3224.10 --> 3227.90]  have people actually figured them out maybe they have maybe they haven't right and there's a lot of
[3227.90 --> 3233.78]  unknowns in there about whether or not you know like tj i think was saying maybe we end up with things
[3233.78 --> 3238.86]  that are actually more efficient than these llms and then you really can't uh scale them so there's a
[3238.86 --> 3242.14]  lot more risk i guess that's why i was saying that i maybe people appreciate would be the only thing i
[3242.14 --> 3247.88]  would say yeah i would say the the only sort of like counterpoint even though like i do agree that
[3247.88 --> 3252.58]  it i mean everything for me and ai seems super risky it seems super easy to like make everything
[3252.58 --> 3260.40]  it's terrible is um the the great philosopher the dax uh you guys may be familiar with him
[3260.40 --> 3269.16]  from a previous episode um oh my goodness what did you just say right trash 2.0 oh that's that's a
[3269.16 --> 3279.60]  huge insult to those okay trash 3.0 3.3.5 trash sonnet 3.5 trash sonnet haiku ultra plus medium
[3279.60 --> 3290.40]  uh is people do choose the lazy option like you can already see right now like it's true you it's
[3290.40 --> 3297.64]  easier to run a website on your own hardware probably than ever before and more people choose not to run
[3297.64 --> 3302.10]  on their own hardware i'm not saying that's like a inherently wrong decision it's just like the
[3302.10 --> 3307.80]  easier option true so there is still something to be said like oh if they could make a really easy
[3307.80 --> 3315.02]  experience for having this especially if it's like for thin clients where i can continue having to buy
[3315.02 --> 3320.64]  a new macbook every two years because apple releases it in a new color and then like i can just like
[3320.64 --> 3326.46]  continue to use the gpus in the data center there is something like there that probably is like
[3326.46 --> 3333.16]  quite uh quite useful and powerful even if it becomes oh all the models are open and all of
[3333.16 --> 3337.40]  them are just like able to be run locally with no licensing fee or something there's still
[3337.40 --> 3343.20]  i think like some at least some utility there i don't know if then it's a hundred billion dollar
[3343.20 --> 3347.90]  company or not you know what i mean but that's more my question because then it becomes more commodity
[3347.90 --> 3353.60]  it's just like which to be fair is maybe why microsoft and google and these places are just like
[3353.60 --> 3357.12]  look this is just a data center business it's not going to be that much different than what we're
[3357.12 --> 3362.08]  doing now it's just get like you know yes you could run it locally we're hoping that you don't bother
[3362.08 --> 3367.74]  uh off off you go right there you know i imagine a lot of data center center companies live in fear of
[3367.74 --> 3373.42]  someone ever actually going maybe i'll make a really good peer-to-peer like system because that would
[3373.42 --> 3378.40]  just wipe out the entire business overnight right but yeah it hasn't happened yet so maybe they're just
[3378.40 --> 3384.44]  like it won't right yeah so totally fair all right all fair well have we have we beat to death this
[3384.44 --> 3391.60]  microsoft opening the sources and gpus i think so all right hey no blockers here huh uh blockers at all
[3391.60 --> 3399.14]  probably just wrap it up cut it all right we'll do clarna next time we can do clarna next time we can do
[3399.14 --> 3406.02]  clarna next time yeah all right well that was wonderful thanks that doesn't sound sincere that's the
[3406.02 --> 3411.22]  conclusion yeah that's wonderful that was like thanks i was just like oh this was terrible
[3411.22 --> 3417.40]  i part of me was excited so i wasn't expecting okay then let's do it prime go uh go hit me
[3417.40 --> 3422.24]  let's just i'm here for it let's just not do it i guess okay fine i'll go for it i'll just
[3422.24 --> 3428.20]  clarna now chat says clarna now okay now clarna cheese trail going let it happen i was thinking we'd do
[3428.20 --> 3432.72]  it i would think we we were going to talk clarna one part this month one part next month
[3432.72 --> 3439.04]  month after that and then we'd finally do it all all right clarna part one hit us prime clarna part
[3439.04 --> 3445.92]  one i think tj just did clarna part one which is this corner sees okay so obviously dax uh we are
[3445.92 --> 3450.44]  we are talking with dax earlier about clarna and they still make a lot of money so i do think that
[3450.44 --> 3453.96]  they're probably not nearly in as much business problem as they being said but for those that
[3453.96 --> 3459.64]  don't know clarna is clarna somehow has managed to become into the center spotlight multiple times
[3459.64 --> 3465.22]  though we should probably have never even heard of clarna so one thing that clarna does uh is that
[3465.22 --> 3471.42]  they do some sort of effectively layaway like style except for you get the item right away so you do
[3471.42 --> 3477.14]  easy payments of x many dollars for some something that costs y right so if you wanted to buy a burrito
[3477.14 --> 3483.46]  you could literally pay with clarna and then pay in installments for the burrito like they have
[3483.46 --> 3489.98]  completely uh they like integrated with uber eats yeah they've monetized your entire world a payment
[3489.98 --> 3496.24]  plan yeah so you could you can lay away anything at this point you can you can just pay over time for
[3496.24 --> 3501.52]  me is it called layaway because you just lay away the whole day like after doing that or what like
[3501.52 --> 3506.54]  that was the best i got it's one hour later people are gonna leave a comment that that one was good
[3506.54 --> 3513.26]  they probably won't but i okay so i think there's a couple things and then clarna also has become
[3513.26 --> 3518.82]  really well known over the last year because they are also the same company that fired most of the
[3518.82 --> 3525.62]  people working at clarna and replaced them with ai and said that ai is the future only two almost
[3525.62 --> 3532.56]  exactly one year later go whoopsie daisies it turns out it didn't work and now they're rehiring people
[3532.56 --> 3538.00]  and saying actually people are super important to the ai process and so clarna has kind of like a
[3538.00 --> 3544.44]  history of acting in kind of goofy ways but i do think that there's maybe a fundamental problem here
[3544.44 --> 3550.84]  which is that how i typically look especially at micro loans like this is that it is purely an
[3550.84 --> 3555.28]  advantage or it's purely an opportunity to take advantage of people who do not have enough money
[3555.28 --> 3561.38]  right like because you're not people who are getting a loan on a 15 meal like that that you're in a
[3561.38 --> 3566.96]  state that's not very good and so they're like this is not this is not a recommended state of life
[3566.96 --> 3573.38]  like this is actually a really kind of crappy business model and morally it feels like they've
[3573.38 --> 3578.50]  just been on the wrong side of every argument consistently ai is better than people oh wait no
[3578.50 --> 3584.14]  they're not people should be uh people we should commoditize even people that are broke maybe maybe not
[3584.14 --> 3589.58]  do that maybe this is not the place to be i don't know i see clarna as just like a pretty uh awful
[3589.58 --> 3595.00]  company and i'm not even sure how to process that they have been doing all this and now it's coming
[3595.00 --> 3599.64]  out that they might be losing money and it turns out that when you give people who cannot afford even
[3599.64 --> 3605.38]  meals alone that they may not even be able to pay back that money as well so it's kind of i mean
[3605.38 --> 3611.96]  it's kind of funny in some sense that they might be reaping what they've what they've created yet again
[3611.96 --> 3620.88]  so i should act as a a poor substitute for dax here and also a good substitute for myself yeah by
[3620.88 --> 3627.74]  just saying that both he and i read the actual financial statement that they put out like the
[3627.74 --> 3636.56]  investor relations statement and if you look at it the actual losses are not really like it doesn't
[3636.56 --> 3642.66]  look like at least from that report that the losses are because consumers aren't paying them back that's
[3642.66 --> 3649.18]  the only thing that i would want to put out there and dax had a more positive take on it i then i do
[3649.18 --> 3655.86]  because i i mean i just i'll go ahead and say i think he's more of a like startup kind of like uh business
[3655.86 --> 3662.32]  growth kind of person mindset wise so he's like this is normal the way that these financials look and i
[3662.32 --> 3668.74]  agree with that but i'm also like but also a lot of these things end up failing and or selling out to
[3668.74 --> 3673.32]  people who then have to pick up the pieces because it turns out not to work out that well or things
[3673.32 --> 3678.70]  like that right uh and so when you look at the financials here the the thing is really what they've
[3678.70 --> 3685.48]  done is the they've paid a bunch of stock compensation to people like it was called stock-based
[3685.48 --> 3690.86]  payments was like the line item right which it's not a publicly traded company so it's hard to know
[3690.86 --> 3694.78]  exactly what they mean by that but generally speaking it's like things where you give people
[3694.78 --> 3701.16]  stock or you do things based on stock where you're trying to pay employees out of that or you're trying
[3701.16 --> 3705.48]  to you know you're trying to like you're trying to use your stock as a way of of paying for things
[3705.48 --> 3712.76]  that you need and um for lack of a better term a lot of times corporations try to claim that this is
[3712.76 --> 3716.72]  sort of like a one-off thing like it's like well we won't have to do that recurring because it's just
[3716.72 --> 3720.46]  these bonuses that people got or these like you know things that people were getting stock options
[3720.46 --> 3725.58]  and whatever but a lot of times they tend to have to continue because in software like this is my
[3725.58 --> 3730.16]  perspective in software you constantly have all this upkeep and you constantly have this challenge
[3730.16 --> 3735.54]  of retaining talent and all these other things and so when i look at that and i see you know that on a
[3735.54 --> 3740.72]  balance sheet i i think dax was like oh that could just go away and i'm more like i don't know that it
[3740.72 --> 3745.84]  can it really depends on the corporation so i think we both came down on it it's too early to tell what's
[3745.84 --> 3749.76]  going to happen with clarna he was maybe more positive and i was more negative i don't think anyone
[3749.76 --> 3754.40]  knows for sure and especially without a publicly traded company they're they're under like they
[3754.40 --> 3758.54]  don't have as much disclosure requirements i don't think i don't know how things work in sweden i you
[3758.54 --> 3763.58]  know i don't know or whatever that is but so i would just say i would be careful reading too much
[3763.58 --> 3768.42]  into this i don't think we have a good picture about whether this company will work out or not i hate
[3768.42 --> 3773.06]  to rain on that particular uh parade prime because i kind of agree with you that it sounds like a bit of
[3773.06 --> 3779.10]  a sleazy company or sleazy business model but i don't think this necessarily shows us much about them
[3779.10 --> 3784.50]  this particular report that's all i could say so i have a question as someone who didn't read the
[3784.50 --> 3788.50]  financial statement okay good because i was literally have no idea what i'm reading i also
[3788.50 --> 3795.84]  have expectations thank you so i do agree that um i think businesses like this suck and you know to be
[3795.84 --> 3800.16]  honest i personally would like to see them go under my question is to casey because he probably knows
[3800.16 --> 3805.02]  this is so say a company like this does go under what do they do with all that debt do they just do
[3805.02 --> 3809.58]  they effectively sell it to someone else and then there's like some collector that kind of just
[3809.58 --> 3816.34]  has to like obviously get the money somehow like how does that work you mean the consumer debt yeah
[3816.34 --> 3823.04]  yeah yeah usually i mean you know in the u.s anyway we have bankruptcy court right and where you would go
[3823.04 --> 3828.94]  in and the bankruptcy court basically tries to apportion things out to your creditors so all the
[3828.94 --> 3834.82]  people who you owe money to and presumably those consumer loans have like all these consumer micro
[3834.82 --> 3840.00]  loans they have value to the extent that the consumers are going to pay them back and that's
[3840.00 --> 3844.96]  some percentage right which clarna internally knows like they've got an idea of that and of course
[3844.96 --> 3850.74]  like the 2008 mortgage crisis you never know when that's going to go south too like their models are
[3850.74 --> 3856.16]  all based on what they think is going to happen but you never know like all the consumers could start
[3856.16 --> 3860.60]  defaulting on clarna tomorrow right and that would be this huge upset in their business model so i don't
[3860.60 --> 3866.82]  know about any of that but yeah what would happen is other creditors people who that clarna owed money
[3866.82 --> 3872.08]  to would get those loans apportioned to them to receive the payments to the extent that they were
[3872.08 --> 3876.26]  going to come in would be what i would assume would happen in bankruptcy court if they file for
[3876.26 --> 3881.28]  but reality is they'll probably get purchased if they right they would probably get purchased by someone
[3881.28 --> 3886.88]  you know a paypal or a stripe who just picks them up and then like slow like integrates that into some
[3886.88 --> 3891.62]  of their stuff and does something with it right that would be my guess i doubt they would flat go out
[3891.62 --> 3896.88]  of business but i don't know it's not my realm that you should have dax on maybe he studies this stuff
[3896.88 --> 3902.16]  closer i only read these sort of things to find out like i just said whether or not the news story is
[3902.16 --> 3907.52]  accurate with what they portray they definitely weren't in this case right uh they they kind of spun it the
[3907.52 --> 3912.26]  way they wanted to and it doesn't necessarily represent the underlying financials yet yeah
[3912.26 --> 3917.48]  could change in the future the the only thing i want to say the reason that i brought this up i just
[3917.48 --> 3923.56]  wanted to show a tweet of mine can i show it right now prime yeah yeah go for it okay nice um
[3923.56 --> 3930.16]  that's not showing anything yeah no it's not i was like that looks good it's a really good tweet
[3930.16 --> 3941.64]  yeah what is that tj hodl hodl okay nice there we go cinema what's a skill that can be picked up in
[3941.64 --> 3945.26]  one month i will have compounding returns the rest of your life usury
[3945.26 --> 3953.92]  that's all that's that's the reason that i put this on the on the market thank you everybody
[3953.92 --> 3958.98]  and prime if you have anything you want to say now feel free no one's gonna know that term
[3958.98 --> 3964.74]  no one's gonna know the usury usury is dead a debt collection effectively uh yeah i i think that
[3964.74 --> 3971.10]  i think the thing that's really interesting here is that this is a news item that shouldn't be a news
[3971.10 --> 3978.22]  item about a company because people hate them that much there's like a general dislike of them so much
[3978.22 --> 3983.50]  that i think that when people hear this it's like a celebratory moment like hey i think it's bad what
[3983.50 --> 3988.86]  they're doing therefore yay like for me the the whole usury thing i think is just obviously bad
[3988.86 --> 3994.16]  but i truly only know them for their just dumb takes on ai i can tell you all about those takes
[3994.16 --> 3999.68]  and it's just shocking that this company just just manages to constantly be in the spotlight for their
[3999.68 --> 4005.76]  behavior and so it's just curious how long like how do you even do this as a company how can you be
[4005.76 --> 4010.98]  so universally disliked i just find completely fascinating even people with no skin in the game
[4010.98 --> 4015.76]  are like i don't like them i don't like them one bit well the funniest part about that would be
[4015.76 --> 4020.92]  when you look at the balance sheet it's like okay you know one of the big losses was the stock-based
[4020.92 --> 4025.12]  compensation stuff or you know again we don't have a breakdown of what that actually entails
[4025.12 --> 4029.94]  but it would be hilarious if a lot of that was because they had to go back and like make good
[4029.94 --> 4034.78]  offers to all the people that they got rid of because of the ai that would be pretty funny right
[4034.78 --> 4040.62]  it's like oh my god whoops but i it probably isn't that like i don't know right so like i said but
[4040.62 --> 4046.00]  that would be humorous obviously to your point in prime yes i i would just love it i don't know i
[4046.00 --> 4050.28]  just find i just find this more fascinating not from a what they're actually losing their money for
[4050.28 --> 4056.46]  it's just that it's weird to see a company so disliked even continue to be successful or continue
[4056.46 --> 4061.26]  to be running as a company i would just assume they'd go under but it it looks like what people
[4061.26 --> 4067.58]  think on twitter is abstract or not even true to actual reality which is a time and time again point
[4067.58 --> 4072.20]  that's proven to me over and over again yeah well of course also these financial statements are
[4072.20 --> 4077.84]  always cooked like i said like so you know i mean again and not even a public company so who knows
[4077.84 --> 4082.28]  what's going on right we have we have you can go look at it it's a pdf you're like i wouldn't know
[4082.28 --> 4087.02]  what i'm looking at yes you would it's literally just there's like one page and it just says crap on
[4087.02 --> 4092.52]  the side like here is the line item and here's the number and you don't really get much breakdown from
[4092.52 --> 4097.56]  it um because you know i don't think they are under any maybe they are i don't know i don't even
[4097.56 --> 4102.32]  know why they put that out right maybe under sweden law they have to i don't know again i studied
[4102.32 --> 4107.56]  this for five seconds before this podcast just to see because it's not i don't care i do not care
[4107.56 --> 4113.06]  about clarna one bit other than the mild disdain that i would have just from your description of
[4113.06 --> 4117.18]  their business model right but i'm just saying so you can go look at that sheet and that's as much
[4117.18 --> 4123.04]  information as i think people have so really anyone who's creating a narrative out of it is largely
[4123.04 --> 4127.38]  just making it up unless they've got an insider giving them information because it's just there's not
[4127.38 --> 4133.60]  much there right what we can say is it's not an overwhelmingly obvious set of numbers that would
[4133.60 --> 4137.66]  lead you to the conclusion that it's because consumers aren't paying them back like that we
[4137.66 --> 4142.10]  could say for sure like the set of numbers they published does not tell that story what the truth
[4142.10 --> 4147.74]  is i have no idea well i think we can end it here the clarna section is actually not that interesting
[4147.74 --> 4152.28]  i just really just dislike them so i just wanted to say i just like them you know as any good stand up
[4152.28 --> 4156.12]  i'm sorry i'm sorry all right they sound like a pharmaceutical they sound like those like medicine
[4156.12 --> 4160.82]  commercials where it's like try clarna side effects diarrhea ask your doctor if clarna is right for
[4160.82 --> 4164.56]  you exactly that's like the first thing that popped in my head when someone mentioned clarna
[4164.56 --> 4170.94]  trash trash does literally zero research every single okay well i was gonna say i read the article but
[4170.94 --> 4178.74]  my initial reaction was diarrhea okay anyways on that note i was gonna say vote for teach 2028
[4178.74 --> 4184.60]  uh i'm gonna be running on uh chipotle burrito forgiveness i'm gonna be forgiving everyone's
[4184.60 --> 4189.62]  chipotle burrito loans so if you're interested in that if that's kind of your target demographic
[4189.62 --> 4195.16]  consider me uh for voting i'd be happy to represent your interests and i just wanted to close on that
[4195.16 --> 4200.36]  note thank you can we get some tj2028 in the comments
[4200.36 --> 4207.78]  he has like no pants on just a nice shirt oh shoot can you see that no no

[4218.20 --> 4221.48]  your reaction i was like oh man i'm sorry for calling you out
[4221.48 --> 4225.88]  wait am i the only one who's not wearing pants for this podcast
