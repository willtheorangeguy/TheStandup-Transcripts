[0.00 --> 5.52]  Yeah, I am a little disappointed. I was saying to Trash, we should have done a gag where like the whole time
[6.04 --> 12.76]  Trash talks about Tailwind like very authoritatively, but like slightly wrong or something. No, listen, you don't understand
[13.44 --> 15.44]  Tailwind is the future
[15.44 --> 19.52]  Like ten minutes in we're like and we've got Adam the creator of Tailwind and trash just like
[20.00 --> 22.50]  YouTube shocked face hangs up. Yeah
[23.58 --> 27.32]  It just says like that OBS screen shows up or it's just like camera gone
[30.00 --> 34.64]  So funny. Yeah, because if you hung up and screw up my entire is it would screw up everything else
[34.64 --> 36.64]  So we can't I can't have you hang out
[40.96 --> 46.84]  Anyway, sorry. All right. All right. All right. Let's get started because this actually so this standup
[46.84 --> 55.56]  I am particularly excited about today. We have with us Teej as always trash Dev and Adam joining us Adam being the creator of
[55.92 --> 57.76]  Tailwind may have heard of it
[57.76 --> 59.76]  Probably
[59.76 --> 60.40]  Anyways
[60.40 --> 61.44]  Probably
[61.44 --> 68.56]  I hear it's my favorite form of CSS really, but you said something in a podcast where you said open source is pain
[68.56 --> 70.56]  I think was your direct
[70.56 --> 71.44]  Exactly
[71.44 --> 73.20]  Open source is pain
[73.20 --> 80.04]  Wait a minute. There are so many versions of this. There is so many people who make articles
[80.04 --> 83.64]  Here's an article that I just I think I read this one like two years ago open source is broken
[84.04 --> 86.84]  Slash or why I uh, why I write
[86.84 --> 91.00]  uh useful software and or I why I don't write useful software unless if you pay me
[91.00 --> 92.84]  Which I think is a great subtitle
[92.84 --> 95.56]  It's like i'm just not gonna do unless if you pay me money to do it
[95.56 --> 101.16]  And so there's a bunch about open uh open source and I think that I know tj you've done a lot of open source
[101.16 --> 102.84]  Adam you've done a lot of open source
[102.84 --> 106.84]  I got burnt out from open source in 2017 and have pretty much never done it since
[107.24 --> 109.32]  And so I am very uh curious
[109.32 --> 114.28]  About what you meant by that line and then even more so if we can just talk about yeah, let me
[115.80 --> 121.32]  Let me just imagine myself saying that and try to think of like what I could have possibly meant when I was saying that
[121.64 --> 123.24]  I think like I don't know what I
[123.72 --> 129.88]  I don't know that I would say I mean open source is open source at scale is uh is hard, you know, um
[131.80 --> 134.20]  To go kind of the to the beginning like I
[135.40 --> 136.60]  I think
[136.60 --> 138.60]  Different people think of open source differently
[139.72 --> 140.76]  I
[140.76 --> 145.16]  My favorite and least stressful way to think of open source is like I made a thing
[146.28 --> 151.24]  Uh, there's no real reason for me to not let other people see how I made it
[151.24 --> 154.20]  So fuck it here. It is on the internet if this
[155.24 --> 159.24]  Helps get you a little bit closer to something you were trying to build a little bit faster
[159.24 --> 163.32]  You can adapt this code to something else or saves you some time
[164.68 --> 169.16]  Cool, you know, but it's like this very no strings attached version of open source
[169.16 --> 174.04]  Where it's open because why not not because you know, i'm trying to
[174.84 --> 176.36]  Do some
[176.36 --> 179.56]  Service for the world or solve this problem for everyone
[179.56 --> 183.88]  It's like I solved the problem for me if you want to learn from the code like go check it out
[183.88 --> 186.12]  I think that's like the best relationship
[187.16 --> 191.08]  For maintainers and consumers to to generally have with open source and
[191.72 --> 193.40]  Like I think dhh has done like a
[194.04 --> 198.60]  Good job of really sort of like internalizing and sort of like espousing this version of things
[199.32 --> 199.80]  but
[199.80 --> 201.08]  Ironically like I
[201.08 --> 202.04]  I
[202.04 --> 206.20]  Make a living doing open source, which is kind of like the the opposite of that, you know
[207.32 --> 211.00]  But if you if you build something open source that ends up
[211.48 --> 215.88]  Taking on a life of its own and getting used by tons and tons and tons of people
[216.28 --> 222.12]  It's hard not to sort of feel like a duty and responsibility to like steward it properly and maintain it and
[222.84 --> 226.84]  Improve it and stuff like that and when you get into that spot
[227.40 --> 228.68]  um
[228.76 --> 232.76]  It necessitates like working on this stuff full time and then figuring out how
[233.40 --> 237.00]  To do that is really is really tricky and a lot of people will say
[237.72 --> 243.32]  Okay, well i'm going to like build this open source project make it really popular then i'm gonna like make some little
[244.20 --> 251.40]  Side business out of it where I can maybe work five hours a week on that and then spend the other 35 hours of the week
[251.40 --> 256.76]  Like maintaining the open source, but that's actually like super insanely hard and unrealistic because what you're actually saying
[256.84 --> 262.44]  Is I want to build a business that I only have to work on for five hours a week that pays me a full-time salary
[262.44 --> 266.68]  Forget like what else you're gonna do with the rest of 35 hours and reality is like building
[267.32 --> 270.44]  A business is a lot of work to get off the ground and
[271.08 --> 274.36]  You know rarely takes even just like the regular 40 hours
[275.40 --> 276.68]  That people
[276.68 --> 281.88]  Put into it whether you're a vibe coder or a handcrafted free-range neo vim user
[281.88 --> 286.76]  You still need ci to be able to build your binaries run your tests or make your releases
[287.08 --> 288.76]  That's where blacksmith comes in
[288.76 --> 293.56]  It takes your github actions and with a one line change makes them faster and more cost effective
[293.56 --> 294.36]  Not only that
[294.36 --> 298.84]  But you can finally get visibility into your ci pipeline right when things go wrong
[298.84 --> 305.16]  We're happy to have them as our sponsor for this episode because just like us this one is truly a no-brainer sign up and enjoy faster
[305.16 --> 310.92]  GitHub action workflows at a much lower price blacksmith twice the speed and up to 75% reduction in costs
[310.92 --> 313.48]  Check them out at blacksmith.sh now back
[314.04 --> 320.28]  To the stand up as something like tailwind scale like just like the issues just keep pouring in and pouring in and
[321.16 --> 326.20]  You want to stay on top of it even though 95% of them are not even problems
[326.20 --> 333.08]  It's just like reading it and understanding why it's not a problem and then figuring out where to put it or how to delete it or how to
[333.08 --> 336.44]  Respond to it instead, you know, but you're basically getting like
[336.44 --> 338.44]  DDoSed by like your
[339.32 --> 342.04]  By the world in this giant inbox that you um
[343.24 --> 346.76]  That you can't can't really control and um
[347.64 --> 348.68]  Yeah, it's it's
[350.04 --> 353.40]  It's just like a a big responsibility, you know
[353.96 --> 359.00]  And I think when I was talking on that podcast i'm trying to remember like what I would have
[359.80 --> 363.24]  Said about it. I think I was talking about this new thing that we're working on
[363.96 --> 364.92]  Which is um
[365.96 --> 367.56]  Kind of like a web components
[368.60 --> 377.64]  E version of things like radix and base ui and headless ui and react aria because like one of the ways that we make money with tailwind
[377.64 --> 385.32]  Or like basically the way is we have a website that you can pay for access to that has a bunch of component ui examples and stuff
[386.20 --> 387.40]  And those are
[387.40 --> 394.20]  In html or react or in view, but historically the ones that are pure html if there was like any interactive bits to them
[394.20 --> 396.28]  You were just sort of on the hook for doing that yourself
[397.00 --> 400.60]  And doing that stuff like properly is actually like an insane amount of work
[401.00 --> 402.12]  um
[402.12 --> 408.36]  With all the keyboard navigation and aria attributes and weird horrible accessibility bugs and stuff
[408.92 --> 417.00]  um, so that's been like probably the most common reason for like refunds or people not buying as people who are not react review users and just are
[417.00 --> 418.28]  bummed that
[418.28 --> 423.48]  I have to write 600 lines of javascript to make this fucking hamburger menu work properly or something, you know
[424.52 --> 427.56]  Or they just do like a shitty job of it and um
[428.12 --> 431.56]  I can relate to that last part this they still had to do it themselves, right?
[431.56 --> 435.48]  So anyways, right point is like we're working on this like web component c
[436.20 --> 440.92]  Just a script tag cdn thing you can pull in where you can just use custom elements and get a lot of the same
[441.80 --> 445.40]  Kind of composable behaviors working in just like a more pure html
[445.96 --> 452.36]  Environment and I was just talking about how in the past it would have been like really obvious to me to just like open source that because that's kind
[452.36 --> 454.28]  Of what you do with code it feels like
[454.92 --> 456.36]  but now
[456.36 --> 460.84]  In the position that we're in like trying to make the business sustainable and stuff like that there's this
[461.72 --> 463.64]  The incentives are kind of reversed, you know
[463.64 --> 468.36]  It's I feel pressure to keep it closed source because if we open source it
[468.68 --> 473.80]  Then we have people who like build competing products to us that build on our open source stuff
[473.80 --> 475.64]  And they don't have to maintain the open source stuff
[475.64 --> 479.96]  So they get to pour all their time and effort into competing with us and we have to spend
[480.36 --> 485.24]  90% of our time improving the tools they use to compete with us and 10% of the time competing with them
[485.24 --> 486.76]  And it's just kind of like a shitty
[489.48 --> 494.68]  It's just a shitty thing because you want when you make something that's open source and used by a bunch of people
[494.68 --> 499.00]  You want to be like pumped and excited about when people are building cool things with it and stuff like that
[499.96 --> 502.68]  But when you're trying to sort of like build a business out of it
[502.68 --> 507.88]  The incentives end up kind of pushing you the other way and sometimes it kind of feels like you're at odds with your own community
[507.88 --> 512.28]  And it's just a tricky problem to to figure out how to solve because I don't know
[512.28 --> 517.80]  I love like just making cool stuff and just putting it out into the world and I prefer not to really think about the
[518.76 --> 522.04]  Commercial side of it that much, you know, um
[522.68 --> 524.76]  But yeah, I don't know. That's kind of just a ramble
[525.72 --> 526.44]  rant about
[527.08 --> 534.36]  uh, you know, probably what I meant there, but yeah, I don't know it's it's uh, just a lot to to figure out and wrestle with and
[534.36 --> 540.92]  Yeah, I always found the like yeah, i'll just make a really successful open source thing and then on the side
[540.92 --> 544.68]  I'll also do like a just a little business thing that pays the bills and you're like
[545.16 --> 550.12]  Bro, that's like lightning striking twice, man. You're just like yeah, well probably my strategy
[550.92 --> 556.28]  Super successful open source product maybe win the lottery, uh, hopefully like lost uncle
[556.28 --> 563.48]  I didn't know about with inheritance and then i'm also on an oil field on my house and you're like, okay, that's not a business plan guys
[563.48 --> 565.48]  That's not a strategy for a successful life
[566.52 --> 571.96]  When I was watching prime stream the other day and he said something that made me think of the same thing where we're talking about like
[572.36 --> 577.88]  How to sort of succeed in an ai dominated world and you know, we're talking
[578.12 --> 582.92]  He was commenting on a comment that I made about like wanting to uh, just lean more into like
[584.20 --> 588.12]  Having a captive audience and making sure that you have a lot of people paying attention to you
[588.12 --> 590.12]  So you actually have people's attention
[590.12 --> 596.44]  And uh, you know prime was saying yeah, you know like that's the strategy like oh first like just be famous. That's the first step
[600.84 --> 601.80]  Yeah, step one
[602.36 --> 605.40]  Well, peter what you're trying to do this without being famous first
[605.40 --> 608.04]  Like why don't you just go do the famous part first god?
[608.68 --> 610.68]  Like being a movie or something
[610.68 --> 612.68]  Yeah
[612.68 --> 621.08]  Like it's just yeah, exactly wait you tried to release a tequila without like first being an a-list celebrity like what what are you thinking?
[623.08 --> 625.48]  So I actually so I feel like I can embody
[626.04 --> 632.04]  The youtube comments because I I just like i've read so many of them that I just feel like I can deliver it to you
[632.04 --> 635.64]  And so I feel like the very first youtube comment
[635.64 --> 640.52]  That's probably going to be 100 of them are going to go along the line of something like
[641.08 --> 644.60]  You should just give away the code. Why are you concerned about making money?
[644.84 --> 648.20]  This is open source. We should be doing this for the good of humanity
[648.20 --> 651.08]  So why aren't you making tailwind more open and free?
[651.64 --> 654.04]  I assume that's going to be like one of the top comments
[654.04 --> 657.80]  But now that I said it hopefully I've now destroyed that top comment because it is so
[658.36 --> 662.04]  At least I feel very upsetting internally to me
[662.04 --> 667.08]  But I want to hear your thoughts about that because like why aren't you just open sourcing everything and yeah
[667.08 --> 670.44]  Doing everything out of the goodness of your heart. Why why even create a business to begin with?
[670.44 --> 674.52]  Sure, sure it's because like there's costs involved, right? Like
[675.80 --> 677.88]  I don't know that's kind of like the simple version
[678.44 --> 680.44]  um, so
[681.00 --> 683.72]  No one can like work full time and
[683.72 --> 688.36]  Build maintain like open source on the side forever, you know, um
[688.92 --> 695.56]  You can maybe do that for quite a while when you're like 21 years old and like single and living in an apartment by yourself
[695.96 --> 702.20]  But like I have three kids, you know that are like seven and under and I want to spend time with them and i'm
[702.92 --> 705.24]  You know, like I just got a lot of responsibilities outside of
[705.88 --> 706.92]  um
[706.92 --> 708.12]  You know
[708.12 --> 711.16]  Fucking writing open source code and working a full-time job. So
[712.20 --> 716.20]  Uh, you want to work on it full-time and then as the project gets bigger and bigger
[716.20 --> 719.80]  There's just more and more work to do so you need help so you hire people and
[720.52 --> 723.48]  We're like a pretty small team. There's eight of us like three
[723.96 --> 727.80]  Partners and then four full-time guys and one part-time guy
[728.44 --> 732.12]  But our we try to pay people very competitively, you know, so we have like
[732.12 --> 738.28]  A million and a half dollars a year and and expenses that we have to cover so we have to get paid
[738.84 --> 739.64]  um
[739.64 --> 744.20]  from somewhere, you know, and yeah, we could try to run the whole thing on volunteer work
[744.20 --> 749.32]  But someone has to like curate that volunteer work and go through the prs and merge them and yeah
[749.32 --> 753.48]  It's just it doesn't work that way the only way for like something to really be like
[754.36 --> 758.36]  Properly maintained is if people can really devote their full attention to it
[758.36 --> 763.24]  And the only way to be able to devote all your time and attention to something is if you don't have to
[763.72 --> 765.72]  Worry about money because things in life cost money
[765.72 --> 770.28]  So the logical conclusion of that is you somehow get paid money to do that thing
[770.92 --> 771.88]  um, so
[771.88 --> 773.88]  The other thing too is like
[773.88 --> 778.44]  When you start an open source project you're just working on the fun parts. So it's like 100%
[779.08 --> 783.64]  You know, but like it's not all fun parts on v4, you know, like no
[783.64 --> 787.80]  It's almost just gets like harder and harder like that is that that's all that's left
[787.80 --> 790.68]  Yeah, that's all that's left is the unfun parts
[790.68 --> 791.80]  So it's like for sure
[791.80 --> 797.56]  It's also harder to get people to volunteer their time to go and spend
[798.28 --> 807.80]  160 hours debugging cross-platform build issues to make github actions not get stalled out once a week or something like this
[807.80 --> 812.68]  Right, you're like and someone has then like you make like idiotic decisions as a maintainer
[812.68 --> 815.56]  Like rewriting like a ton of it and rust to make it faster
[816.36 --> 822.76]  And now like you have to maintain that and you have to make sure it builds for all these different platforms
[822.76 --> 829.16]  Because you have to worry about this native code running in all these environments when before it was just fucking javascript, you know
[829.72 --> 834.76]  How much of a difference did that make by the way was that was that like a huge difference a huge difference?
[834.76 --> 836.60]  but we were very strategic about how we
[837.40 --> 842.44]  Used it so like we didn't just like write it in rust to write it in rust the main things that we did in rust
[843.00 --> 844.44]  that had a huge benefit is
[845.48 --> 851.48]  First of all like the way tailwind works in general right is it has to like look at all of the files in your project and figure out
[851.48 --> 856.28]  What all the class names are and pull all those class names out and then generate the css for those class names
[856.28 --> 863.24]  So that work is very very parallel parallelizable work, right?
[863.24 --> 868.20]  Because you can just like split that work up look at different files across different cores can't do that in javascript
[868.44 --> 873.64]  So instantly moving that work into something that supports parallelism
[874.28 --> 880.04]  Uh makes things like four to six billion times faster, you know, depending on how many cores you have on your machine
[880.76 --> 884.20]  Um, so that is a huge piece of it and then the other piece of it is
[885.16 --> 890.20]  Just the actual work to look through the files and like figure out what's a class and what's just
[890.92 --> 896.20]  Bullshit used to just be a bunch of crazy ass regular expressions in javascript
[896.52 --> 901.64]  Because like regular expressions are actually like the only fast thing in javascript when it comes to pulling things out of files
[902.12 --> 905.88]  um, but of course like then you're just sort of like handcuffed by
[906.52 --> 910.44]  What you can express in a regular expression whereas in rust, we're able to write like
[911.16 --> 914.20]  Our own like custom like bit level parser
[914.76 --> 920.76]  That ends up being way faster than the regex thing and also just like way clearer and expressive and uh
[921.72 --> 926.12]  Intentional, you know, um, so that was the other the other big piece
[926.92 --> 930.76]  But that's kind of like the only things we do in rust honestly is those two things
[930.76 --> 937.16]  That's why that's why we don't need all that config anymore, right? Because you're just basically just crawling our entire file system
[938.12 --> 943.32]  Yeah, like now we can crawl the file system without you telling us where to look a lot faster too
[943.32 --> 945.56]  Because that just happens to be a lot faster in rust
[945.56 --> 949.24]  So there's a bunch of heuristics around it's mostly based on like the git ignore file
[949.24 --> 951.40]  So if you've got something git ignored, we don't look at it
[951.40 --> 955.56]  Which is like a quick shortcut for not looking at node modules and stuff like that
[955.56 --> 958.28]  But then we also ignore like anything more
[961.16 --> 963.16]  That's docker ignore idiot
[963.16 --> 965.16]  How do you guys get it to reproducibly build?
[965.16 --> 967.16]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[967.16 --> 974.44]  But then we also ignore like binary files like fucking jpegs and zip files and anything that is obviously nonsense
[974.76 --> 975.72]  um
[975.72 --> 980.92]  So that yeah that let us remove a bunch of configuration and make a bunch of that stuff faster too
[980.92 --> 986.04]  But it's still uh predominantly a typescript code base now. So yeah
[986.36 --> 988.60]  so with with um, with obviously
[989.08 --> 993.08]  again to kind of going along the lines of people being like why isn't it free and all that
[993.08 --> 993.80]  uh
[993.80 --> 999.80]  before you started a business was there some sort of attempt to rely on say like sponsorship on github
[1000.36 --> 1004.04]  does that actually work out at all because obviously tailwind is arguably probably
[1004.68 --> 1009.48]  top 10 biggest like twitter sized open source projects
[1009.48 --> 1014.76]  I don't think you have a lot of competition as far as like how big your product like everybody knows what tailwind is
[1014.76 --> 1017.32]  At this point that does any sort of web type stuff
[1017.80 --> 1018.92]  and so one would assume
[1019.48 --> 1025.32]  At least i'm sure you'd see this argument over and over again that there'd be a huge amount of people saying oh tailwind must do great with
[1025.64 --> 1029.24]  Donations was that a viable option or does that just not exist as I
[1029.64 --> 1031.64]  secretly think that sponsorship doesn't
[1032.20 --> 1033.96]  As you're leading as you're trying to be
[1033.96 --> 1035.48]  Nice leading question prime great job
[1035.48 --> 1037.48]  No problem
[1037.48 --> 1038.36]  I'm just standing by intentions
[1038.36 --> 1039.48]  Our history is a little
[1040.04 --> 1047.16]  a little strange compared to other open source projects because we actually never tried to solicit any donations or sponsorships at all
[1047.88 --> 1049.08]  um
[1049.08 --> 1053.72]  Steve and I who first built like tailwind ui which was the first commercial thing for tailwind
[1054.44 --> 1059.08]  we did that refactoring ui book back in like 2018. I don't know if you guys ever saw that but it's like a
[1059.64 --> 1061.48]  Teach developers design sort of thing
[1062.36 --> 1069.64]  And that that did super well and still continues to do really well honestly for our pdf on the internet and um
[1070.44 --> 1075.72]  That was like enough for me and steve to focus full-time on tailwind related stuff and then trying to build
[1076.44 --> 1078.92]  um the templates and ui components
[1079.56 --> 1080.60]  business um
[1081.48 --> 1083.96]  So that's kind of like the path that we took
[1083.96 --> 1089.72]  Um interestingly we're exploring sponsorship stuff now which we weren't
[1090.44 --> 1094.92]  Before and I can kind of talk about like what is leading to that
[1095.56 --> 1098.52]  It kind of plays on some of the stuff like we were talking about before but yeah
[1098.52 --> 1101.08]  We'll have to see if if that is actually
[1101.80 --> 1103.56]  viable for us or not
[1103.56 --> 1105.96]  obviously I hope it is because we um
[1106.92 --> 1110.44]  Otherwise wouldn't be trying to do it or at least hope it can contribute to
[1110.44 --> 1111.96]  You know
[1111.96 --> 1114.44]  Our revenue in a meaningful way
[1115.00 --> 1120.60]  And my hope is that because the project is like so big that there will be
[1121.80 --> 1123.00]  Companies that like want to
[1123.72 --> 1125.40]  Throw in and support but I
[1126.36 --> 1128.20]  that to say too I do think like
[1129.56 --> 1130.12]  Even then
[1131.40 --> 1134.52]  Charity is like very hard, you know to get people to
[1135.08 --> 1140.36]  Pull money out of their pockets for people need like my belief anyways is people need like
[1141.32 --> 1144.76]  Something it doesn't even have to be like worth what they're paying
[1145.08 --> 1147.96]  But they need like something to not feel stupid a lot of the time
[1148.76 --> 1150.20]  um
[1150.20 --> 1151.96]  So that's the other thing that we're trying to like
[1152.68 --> 1155.72]  Just sort out is what are the right incentives to create?
[1155.72 --> 1161.56]  What can we give people where they can like feel good about supporting us but also get a little something in exchange
[1161.56 --> 1166.44]  Um, so that it doesn't just feel like like pure charity even if it
[1167.88 --> 1175.48]  You know isn't a product per se but I don't know kind of like you see a lot of people having success with this doing like patreon
[1175.88 --> 1177.56]  type stuff, you know, you just gotta
[1178.20 --> 1183.88]  Give people enough and hopefully at a big enough scale like we get like 10 million visits a month to the tailwind docs
[1184.36 --> 1186.44]  if some like tiny fraction of those people
[1187.16 --> 1189.24]  Are big enough tailwind fans to just like
[1190.28 --> 1191.08]  want that
[1192.20 --> 1192.60]  really
[1193.80 --> 1194.20]  sort of
[1195.24 --> 1195.88]  die hard
[1196.92 --> 1198.92]  sort of extra perky stuff
[1199.40 --> 1200.28]  then maybe that'll
[1201.16 --> 1201.48]  you know
[1202.12 --> 1203.80]  make a meaningful impact
[1204.36 --> 1205.16]  on our bottom line
[1205.16 --> 1207.88]  So that's an experiment that we're about to run anyways
[1207.88 --> 1211.08]  I want to bring this back more back to like the open source stuff so
[1212.36 --> 1212.84]  I haven't
[1212.84 --> 1214.28]  I'm obviously not part of the tailwind team
[1214.28 --> 1217.00]  The repo I've worked on aren't anywhere near as big
[1217.32 --> 1218.76]  but they are like decently big
[1219.48 --> 1222.76]  but I wanted to talk about like some of the pain points which you mentioned like
[1223.16 --> 1226.12]  the sponsorships which is something I've gone down
[1227.40 --> 1231.72]  Mainly because like in open source I find it's kind of just like it really depends on like do you care
[1232.20 --> 1233.24]  about code quality
[1233.80 --> 1237.64]  and all this stuff because if you don't care about code quality you can just start taking contributions like willy-nilly
[1237.64 --> 1238.92]  right? It's like here's like some issue
[1238.92 --> 1240.92]  Yeah, go ahead. I trust you implicitly
[1241.16 --> 1242.52]  but at some point you hit like
[1243.32 --> 1246.36]  some scale depending on if your repo is actually in popular
[1246.36 --> 1248.76]  where you actually have to start caring about this stuff
[1249.56 --> 1250.44]  and
[1250.44 --> 1253.08]  this is where I hit that threshold of
[1253.08 --> 1253.48]  okay
[1254.12 --> 1255.16]  now I got to actually
[1255.88 --> 1256.12]  vet
[1256.76 --> 1257.80]  who I want
[1257.80 --> 1259.16]  to take contributions from
[1259.80 --> 1260.60]  but also like
[1261.56 --> 1264.20]  but also like if it's such a big like high traffic like
[1265.16 --> 1268.44]  like a bunch of contributions coming in it's like are you good enough do I trust you
[1269.16 --> 1271.64]  or what if they do put something in and I don't like it
[1272.20 --> 1274.28]  like I have to deal with these personalities
[1274.84 --> 1277.00]  so and that's where sponsorships come in because then you
[1277.00 --> 1280.28]  you can kind of pick who you want to and you give them an incentive
[1280.68 --> 1283.88]  maybe not initially because they're contributing because they're just they like your project
[1284.52 --> 1288.52]  um but then there's just like so many low quality contributions that it's like okay well
[1289.08 --> 1292.60]  at some point I got to get some core team that's kind of like how I feel like with like your team
[1292.60 --> 1294.68]  I think Robin's still on your team he's like one of my buddies
[1294.68 --> 1294.92]  yeah
[1296.28 --> 1298.76]  and that's where the sponsorships come in because then it's like okay
[1298.76 --> 1302.20]  look I know you're not full-time and I want to give you some incentive
[1302.20 --> 1306.44]  to like give some high quality contributions so here's some like sponsorship money
[1306.44 --> 1307.48]  to do what you can
[1308.12 --> 1312.12]  but this is like when you get to that point that's kind of where I started struggling
[1312.12 --> 1316.28]  in these projects because one I don't want to like hurt people's feelings like they put some
[1316.28 --> 1319.56]  time in and they're just like like look the code quality is not there I don't have time
[1319.56 --> 1324.76]  to like babysit you and learn all this stuff and then it eventually becomes coming eventually
[1324.76 --> 1328.84]  turns into a situation like you where you just have like a core group of people and then it
[1328.84 --> 1335.00]  starts feeling less and less like open source because you kind of just like have like these issues
[1335.00 --> 1339.72]  that you have these people assigned to and then you have to trust these people to say hey I took
[1339.72 --> 1342.92]  this issue are you actually going to finish it am I just going to sit here and look at this issue
[1342.92 --> 1347.40]  for like two weeks and then ping them and be like are you going to do it so it's like I don't know
[1347.40 --> 1352.20]  this is these are like the situations I hit where it's just kind of frustrating I don't really know
[1352.20 --> 1356.76]  what to do about that outside of just being yeah I don't I don't have good answers too but I can
[1356.76 --> 1361.96]  empathize for sure like for the longest time for me like the hardest thing about maintaining a large
[1361.96 --> 1367.96]  open source project was sort of that emotional side of it where you have all these contributions and
[1367.96 --> 1375.56]  stuff and if you just don't like something it's just draining to go in there and try to like let people
[1375.56 --> 1383.40]  down gently or explain why you know this isn't really the right fit for the project or where I
[1383.40 --> 1389.96]  want to take it or or even like I like this idea but like I think I need to like deeply research
[1390.52 --> 1395.56]  the problem that you're trying to solve to make sure that this is the right way to solve it versus
[1395.56 --> 1401.72]  just like merging it blindly and I can't promise that I can make that like my top priority right now so
[1401.72 --> 1409.40]  the issue just sits people get frustrated and um yeah that that part sucks you know we've tried to
[1409.40 --> 1414.20]  manage that by setting expectations and like our contributing guidelines and stuff around
[1414.20 --> 1419.88]  what are good contributions and what are contributions that are going to be hard for you to get merged or
[1419.88 --> 1425.40]  might take a long time to get merged so people aren't too disappointed if something sits um
[1425.40 --> 1435.56]  um for a long time but yeah to me that's that's kind of the tricky part and and if you keep going
[1435.56 --> 1439.88]  down that route then you kind of end up in the spot that you're talking about which is basically where we
[1439.88 --> 1445.08]  are where you just like actually don't get that much in terms of real contributions it ends up being
[1445.08 --> 1451.72]  mostly like support like people opening issues and stuff like that and our projects a little weird too
[1451.72 --> 1458.76]  because our end users are front-end developers but the code base is not like a front-end code base
[1458.76 --> 1463.40]  at all I'm sure this is true for like a lot of open source projects but there are some open source
[1463.40 --> 1469.24]  projects like Laravel for example where basically anyone using it is also like fit to contribute to
[1469.24 --> 1473.88]  it or like has the experience to contribute to it so they end up like with a really vibrant active
[1473.88 --> 1479.72]  community of people contributing stuff whereas we don't really have a ton there's like a couple of people
[1479.72 --> 1487.48]  um who contribute stuff and then otherwise it's it's just the the core team but yeah you're right
[1487.48 --> 1491.72]  it ends up kind of feeling a little bit less certainly feels less like a community project
[1491.72 --> 1498.28]  I think people's definitions of open source kind of differ again I personally kind of hate that
[1499.16 --> 1507.16]  the sort of like social community property connotation has been like attached to the term open source
[1507.16 --> 1511.72]  to me open source just means like you can do whatever you want with the code it doesn't mean
[1511.72 --> 1519.56]  like anyone else is obligated to entertain like your suggestions or um do work to merge your
[1520.44 --> 1530.12]  changes into their fork or whatever um but yeah I don't know yeah for answer any does that contribute to
[1530.12 --> 1535.96]  the conversation then like one thing that I found that was effective because it's really hard if you have
[1535.96 --> 1540.36]  like a decent amount of contributors to figure out who should get money because it's like it seems
[1540.36 --> 1547.56]  super like difficult because some people put in a lot of work for stuff it was helpful we did and I
[1547.56 --> 1552.36]  think it's still the the case I haven't checked in a while but like it was only if you were working
[1552.36 --> 1558.52]  on neo some neo vim thing for like an extended period of time full time that we sponsored people
[1558.52 --> 1564.28]  with neo vim funds which was been like that's how a bunch of big projects got done for neo vim right like
[1564.28 --> 1571.32]  like oh uh like I like I did it I've done it twice for neo vim actually both times where I was on
[1571.32 --> 1576.04]  paternity leave uh like I could I was like okay well I can take a month and I can just work on neo
[1576.04 --> 1581.88]  vim full time like that's that's sure I can work on something um and like that we've gotten a lot of
[1581.88 --> 1587.32]  great features that way and that's like at least a very clear distinction so it doesn't feel like oh my
[1587.32 --> 1591.88]  work's not getting valued I'm not getting any money because when you bring money in this is the other
[1591.88 --> 1597.96]  thing I think people aren't thinking like about oftentimes from the outside looking in is then
[1597.96 --> 1603.48]  it makes all the people not working for money feel weird right like I don't know if you've totally
[1603.48 --> 1608.84]  yeah no I think I think we definitely get a I don't know if we actually have that but it's something I
[1608.84 --> 1616.20]  feel in my head I almost feel like uncomfortable like taking contributions from people uh when there's
[1616.20 --> 1621.48]  a team that's getting paid and then other people you know are just contributing stuff yeah um for
[1621.48 --> 1627.16]  free you know it's weird where money like enters the equation you know it's just kind of like all of a
[1627.16 --> 1632.52]  sudden it's like not a a free volunteer thing anymore if anyone's getting paid like everyone should get
[1632.52 --> 1638.44]  paid or and again I don't know if people actually people contributing actually feel that way I think if
[1638.44 --> 1642.84]  you really think hard about it people are probably just like I want to use this fucking feature so can you
[1642.84 --> 1649.72]  please just put it in the code base but it's it's still a dynamic you know so
[1651.56 --> 1656.92]  yeah so one thing I found kind of weird because I have obviously a very different kind of uh open
[1656.92 --> 1661.88]  source experience than you three because my open source was a sponsored one by Netflix and so I did
[1661.88 --> 1666.28]  that for quite some time it was conference driven development like the whole nine yards I had a
[1666.28 --> 1671.80]  conference schedule that I had to go and talk about the thing right because this was like 2016 2017 where
[1671.80 --> 1677.56]  you sold your idea via the conference circuit if you remember those days great days uh and so for
[1677.56 --> 1684.36]  me the hard part was managing and I Adam I'm actually curious what you have to do with this which is that
[1684.36 --> 1689.08]  you had all these users that started using your product and they all came back with feedback and
[1689.08 --> 1695.72]  things that they wanted to change but ultimately this was more public source or commercial open source
[1695.72 --> 1701.40]  than anything else in the sense that my number one goal was to service Netflix and their needs for the open
[1701.40 --> 1706.52]  source project and so therefore when when people would come and ask for stuff it's like yeah I can
[1706.52 --> 1710.68]  go in our backlog but it's like it's deep in the backlog because really I'm only concerned about
[1710.68 --> 1716.12]  Netflix things for Netflix problems and all these people that are using it can like start getting
[1716.12 --> 1721.08]  further and further kind of frustrations because I'm not servicing what the community wants I service
[1721.08 --> 1726.20]  what serves you know the person paying the bills and I found that to be like a really disheartening
[1726.20 --> 1732.84]  thing because it often led to very disgruntled messages that were not the most kind in any
[1732.84 --> 1739.72]  totally nature yeah no I get the same thing for sure I think uh we've tried to mitigate some of that
[1739.72 --> 1745.96]  by like a lot of repos we use issues for tracking both like bug reports and feature requests and stuff
[1745.96 --> 1751.96]  we are very hardcore about like issues just being bug reports and if someone has an idea for a feature
[1751.96 --> 1756.28]  or ask for something we move that into github discussions and we mostly do that just because
[1757.40 --> 1761.00]  github discussions even though they did add the fucking ability to close them which doesn't really
[1761.00 --> 1766.92]  make any sense to me um just feel like a thing that can just live there whereas like issues you're
[1766.92 --> 1771.56]  supposed to deal with them in some way you know so it's kind of like someone requested this feature
[1771.56 --> 1778.76]  and until it's like closed you know purple or closed red it's fucking just not done and you
[1778.76 --> 1783.24]  haven't done the thing yet when in reality like no one's even like agreed to do it or accepted
[1783.24 --> 1789.48]  the idea or anything like that so I think it has helped us a bit to do that I think the other thing
[1789.48 --> 1796.68]  is just uh you kind of get a bit of a thicker skin over time just telling people hey yeah this is a cool
[1796.68 --> 1803.96]  idea um not why don't you explore it as a plug-in you know like that's one option that we have used in
[1803.96 --> 1809.48]  the past I think that's a good technical solution to that problem anyways is making things extensible
[1809.48 --> 1813.32]  and then if that doesn't work you know I literally just tell people like you can always just like
[1813.32 --> 1817.24]  fork this and everyone just rolls your eyes like you're a fucking asshole like I can't fork this and
[1817.24 --> 1824.52]  maintain it and it's like okay well there you go now you kind of get it you know like um you're asking
[1824.52 --> 1829.96]  me to do the thing that you can't do like we get we're on the same team here really yeah yeah exactly
[1829.96 --> 1834.36]  with what you said there too is like sometimes if it's just like oh our policy is that feature
[1834.36 --> 1841.00]  requests go in discussions then it's just super easy to close issues and then you filter out all
[1841.00 --> 1845.64]  the people that aren't going to read what you write anyways right because yeah yeah yeah they didn't I
[1845.64 --> 1852.20]  love a good policy in general if anytime you can put something on the policy you know I'm sorry that's
[1852.20 --> 1857.88]  that's policy yeah I can't do anything about that yeah you know it's the policy right but it's like it is
[1857.88 --> 1864.44]  like a nice gate actually for like like one thing uh Justin keys who is like the main main maintainer
[1864.44 --> 1871.56]  of neo vim always says like we we can't be afraid to fire users right which is like yeah we we don't
[1871.56 --> 1878.52]  have microsoft budget like we're not going to compete on every vertical with vs code sorry vs right you
[1878.52 --> 1884.92]  know what I mean like we're just not gonna like have that happen so we need to say no to some things
[1884.92 --> 1888.28]  and if for some people that's a deal breaker like they can't use neo vim because of that then it's
[1888.28 --> 1893.96]  like okay that that's okay like it can't can't be everything to everyone or it's nothing to no one
[1893.96 --> 1901.24]  you know it's it's yeah you got to kind of like pick your position on things because there's a lot of
[1901.24 --> 1906.68]  things that you kind of it can only be one way or the other you know right and I think the other
[1906.68 --> 1912.76]  thing too is like sometimes you could feel sort of overwhelmed with people's frustration as as if it's
[1912.76 --> 1918.76]  like the whole world but the reality is it's just like this tiny tiny tiny tiny portion and everyone
[1918.76 --> 1923.32]  who's like satisfied and agrees with the way things are going and thinks it's awesome they have no
[1923.32 --> 1929.16]  reason to say anything so they're just quietly happy and stoked about what you're doing and supporting
[1929.16 --> 1934.36]  you um you're like i've never even opened the tailwind repo yeah yeah what's a repo you know what
[1934.36 --> 1939.72]  i mean right never needed they end the install and they've never looked back ever ever ever ever
[1939.72 --> 1948.20]  yeah exactly so it's it's helpful to sort of remember that too because yeah it's it's it can
[1948.20 --> 1953.56]  be it can be tough in that sense but i think ultimately yeah you just kind of have to be
[1955.00 --> 1961.16]  i mean there's this book that everyone tells me to buy and read that i bought and never read and
[1961.16 --> 1965.24]  don't think i really have to read because just like the title is all the great divorce by c.s lewis
[1965.24 --> 1972.92]  that's right no it's uh it's called it's called it's called the courage to be disliked you know
[1972.92 --> 1978.12]  and even just like that phrase is just like i'm so courageous
[1984.36 --> 1990.44]  but just like even the existence of someone trying to give that advice like makes it easier in in my
[1990.44 --> 1997.16]  experience you know yeah yeah first like dealing with personalities was very frustrating for me
[1997.16 --> 2002.92]  like i felt like i was letting people down or i just felt like i had to service all these people
[2002.92 --> 2007.08]  that were interested in what i was doing i was like oh you're interested let me just make you as happy as
[2007.08 --> 2012.52]  i can yeah at some point i was just like i just can't do this anymore i burnt out like super super bad
[2012.52 --> 2018.36]  like i went from like crazy github squares to just like dark like like nothing and now like i'm still
[2018.36 --> 2023.72]  like feeling the effects from that um but yeah i don't know man people feel very entitled in this
[2023.72 --> 2029.96]  world it's kind of crazy i actually i think i yeah i apply what you're saying but i apply to what i do
[2029.96 --> 2035.72]  now which is streaming is that for a long time i think it's very it's like a very kind of normal
[2035.72 --> 2040.04]  mentality especially for people who are just getting started when they have like say 10 or 15 people
[2040.04 --> 2045.40]  watching them is that like someone comes in and they're just like even if they don't like do anything
[2045.40 --> 2049.64]  that's like breaking whatever rules you have set forth you just like don't like them and you're
[2049.64 --> 2053.64]  just like i don't like the vibe they're bringing i don't like and so many people will be so quick to
[2053.64 --> 2058.52]  cater to their audience or like try to make sure that they're really just fitting to all things and
[2058.52 --> 2063.24]  i realized i don't know when it was it must have been two years ago it just is like you know it's way
[2063.24 --> 2069.72]  better to fire a user even if that like that means that something won't be as successful i'm just okay with
[2069.72 --> 2075.40]  that now and i am much quicker to be like okay this person just like is completely you know left
[2075.40 --> 2080.20]  field i'm just gonna have to ask them to leave because it is just easier to maintain a certain
[2080.20 --> 2085.08]  kind of feel or vibe in a community by just saying no to a few people because it really can change
[2085.08 --> 2090.84]  how people respond because you need just one person to just blow up a conversation a couple times and
[2090.84 --> 2094.36]  then all of a sudden it's just like you have a whole new community coming in getting ready to blow
[2094.36 --> 2104.20]  everything up yeah so yeah i think uh i think the the other thing is like people's uh frustrations are
[2105.16 --> 2110.60]  are not like invalid you know you know what i mean but it doesn't mean it's like your fault or your
[2110.60 --> 2116.68]  responsibility like it both sides can be true you know like um to someone who's like running into some
[2116.68 --> 2122.52]  big problem it's hard for them to really like recognize that as a maintainer you've got like 16 other
[2122.52 --> 2127.32]  priorities that are big issues to other people but this person who has this other problem like isn't
[2127.32 --> 2132.04]  affected by those so it's like sometimes without really thinking hard about it it's hard for people
[2132.04 --> 2136.92]  to understand like why are you not fixing this this thing is clearly the most broken thing in your tool
[2136.92 --> 2144.36]  right now but it's just for their situation that it's the most broken thing but that's still true and still
[2144.36 --> 2153.56]  real so you know yeah i i don't know it's yeah it's it's i guess what i'm trying to say is like
[2154.60 --> 2158.76]  there is like entitlement and stuff uh in open source but like i'm still
[2160.20 --> 2163.96]  general like grateful for the people who use it and the people who raise issues and contribute and
[2163.96 --> 2171.32]  stuff like i think it's easy to fall into this like uh sort of trap of just like hating on like
[2171.32 --> 2175.80]  open source consumers and stuff like that uh the same way like people at fucking dairy queen like
[2175.80 --> 2179.72]  talk about all the customers who come in and buy the ice cream you know but at the end of the day
[2179.72 --> 2184.84]  like you need those people to come and buy the ice cream or you don't have a job you know um
[2185.64 --> 2188.20]  is that a real problem is dairy queen workers talking to
[2192.20 --> 2196.84]  i just i just mean like in general did you ever like work a job when you were a teenager like oh yeah
[2196.84 --> 2206.20]  i was the worst every teenager hates the customers you know so i don't know yeah i try to be i try
[2206.20 --> 2212.12]  to be a more mature version of my teenage self yeah these days you know but uh adam what's the best
[2212.12 --> 2218.36]  way for someone to make an issue and have it be something that then you work on and fix and get close
[2218.36 --> 2226.76]  and close uh yeah i mean if you open an issue with a very clear minimal
[2226.84 --> 2233.48]  reproduction that dramatically increases the odds of it getting fixed you know that's that's the
[2233.48 --> 2239.56]  big thing just make it easy just make it easy for the maintainers to make the fix you know um
[2239.56 --> 2244.04]  so arch users don't know a lot about reproduction though so that might be a bit of a problem
[2244.60 --> 2251.80]  we're gonna put that as an issue requirement mm-hmm i have a another question more about like
[2251.80 --> 2258.44]  the tailwind journey if you don't mind um so the tailwind sorry i was just imagining you pulling up
[2258.44 --> 2267.80]  code and just being like so how can i fix this 732. so if you pull up my site this is this has been
[2267.80 --> 2274.92]  flashing it's killing me it's crazy okay so how can i make this responsive on mobile it's firefox this uh
[2274.92 --> 2281.24]  no but seriously so did tailwind start out as open source like initially yeah yeah so it was like i
[2281.24 --> 2287.32]  released i think it's like the first version was like i think we released on halloween in 2017 and it
[2287.32 --> 2293.56]  was just like an extracted byproduct of me trying to build this other side project okay and i was like
[2293.56 --> 2298.68]  live streaming all my work on it and people kept asking me about the css so i spun it off into like a
[2298.68 --> 2303.72]  little thing and really spun so then i'm curious if it started open source like how did you transition it
[2303.72 --> 2309.40]  into like something you could be paid to do like so i'm assuming like there's a lot of pieces that
[2309.40 --> 2314.68]  are just like closed source that are like the secret sauce but like was there ever like any like
[2314.68 --> 2321.08]  ethical like friction of like i'm gonna start making money from this project that potentially
[2321.08 --> 2325.48]  there was i don't know how many people contributed to but now i'm gonna make this for a living like
[2325.48 --> 2329.24]  was there like a decision where like oh maybe we should pay like a little bit to some of these people
[2329.24 --> 2334.04]  that helped get it off the ground or like what was like that transition like like i'm just like
[2334.04 --> 2338.04]  generally curious yeah yeah yeah no that's a good question i think in my mind the reason it
[2338.04 --> 2342.84]  wasn't like that complicated is because we never charged money for the framework or anything related
[2342.84 --> 2348.60]  to the framework itself like for our css framework like bootstrap has a template marketplace you know
[2348.60 --> 2353.96]  where people build bootstrap templates and sell them and that's basically what we did more or less is
[2353.96 --> 2359.48]  design things build them with tailwind and then like sell those designs so anything that we charged
[2359.48 --> 2366.36]  money for didn't have any like community contributions or anything we just take all that
[2366.36 --> 2372.28]  those funds and pour them back into the development of the framework because um the success of the
[2372.28 --> 2378.52]  framework leads to the success of like the the commercial thing you know so it's a little bit
[2378.52 --> 2384.04]  a little bit different i guess in that sense okay that makes sense that makes sense cool
[2384.68 --> 2389.96]  why trash you got something you're working on right now because it seems like a very specific question
[2389.96 --> 2395.48]  i mean i'm speaking from like actual like things i'm going through it's why i'm like i'm like okay okay
[2395.48 --> 2401.88]  hey okay okay next week i'm done i'm done with my free every eight no i'm just kidding no but like
[2401.88 --> 2406.52]  yeah just i've gone through things that's gonna get you fired at work on the podcast
[2406.52 --> 2410.12]  yeah yeah cut that out just kidding i'm just kidding no one password borrow bros
[2411.80 --> 2415.32]  no but just things that i've gone through in the open source where like
[2415.32 --> 2420.92]  you know i've encountered certain scenarios where i'm like is this ethical i don't know
[2420.92 --> 2424.12]  i'm just not going to do it so i'm just like hearing other people's perspective and then just
[2424.68 --> 2429.72]  dealing with people in open source and how others are kind of dealing with it so
[2431.64 --> 2436.20]  you know yeah i mean that's one thing like i was saying like we're exploring we're
[2436.20 --> 2439.72]  experimenting with sponsorships now like that's like something that we're trying to launch today
[2440.44 --> 2445.24]  and uh i guess like i haven't thought about it at a time because of what i said earlier where we kind
[2445.24 --> 2448.76]  of are in a spot where like the only real contributions to the framework come from people
[2448.76 --> 2454.28]  who already work here already so it kind of makes it feel a little simpler in that sense and anyone who's
[2454.28 --> 2461.08]  like contributing stuff is because they want it so um you know i don't feel feel too bad about it in that
[2461.08 --> 2466.68]  sense but i could definitely understand where it gets tricky and like a project that's been able to
[2466.68 --> 2472.20]  build a really active like contributor community and all of a sudden like the project starts like
[2472.20 --> 2480.20]  taking funds like where does that go it's yeah it's it's a that feels like yeah i don't know i can
[2480.20 --> 2487.40]  understand why someone would feel uh stressed about trying to manage that properly you know yeah for neovim
[2487.40 --> 2493.72]  it it's uh i think like good strategies for like more community style projects where it's not like
[2493.72 --> 2499.24]  oh i i like own this you know like there's not really like in that same way for neovim maybe compared
[2499.24 --> 2504.76]  to like tailwind where it's more like oh it feels like your and like you know the other people who
[2504.76 --> 2510.76]  started it with you adam like your project you know what i mean like neovim it was just like we have
[2510.76 --> 2515.40]  you know like there's a few nice sites like open collective and a few other places where you can see
[2515.40 --> 2520.92]  basically like what money comes into a project and then where it goes and then like i mentioned
[2520.92 --> 2525.56]  earlier for neovim it's just like just have a simple policy where it's like if you're gonna work full
[2525.56 --> 2531.40]  time on something for a while and it gets approved by basically like the core team then then you can
[2531.40 --> 2539.72]  get paid that's easy and like uh i know people do like there's sort of mixed feelings on bug bounties i'm
[2539.72 --> 2545.64]  not really like a huge fan of like bounty stuff it sometimes creates kind of perverse incentives for
[2545.64 --> 2551.16]  like people to be like fighting about who gets to work on what and like external people putting
[2551.88 --> 2556.36]  uh like bounties on stuff can make it very complicated because someone is trying to like
[2557.08 --> 2561.88]  get this pr merge so they can get paid but like they might be at odds with the maintainer i know
[2561.88 --> 2567.88]  andrew kelly from zig has a few articles um kind of talking about that um and prime has a few videos
[2567.88 --> 2575.00]  talking about that andrew kelly's things um so so those those can be kind of complicated but i think
[2575.00 --> 2580.04]  for like a community one if you can set the rules like really clear i i think then it's then it's
[2580.04 --> 2583.80]  obviously if i if someone just randomly sends a pr to neovim they're like yeah that makes sense
[2583.80 --> 2588.84]  i'm not gonna get paid like it's chill even if you send a lot of random prs to neovim there's no
[2588.84 --> 2595.00]  like expectation um but yeah so that's at least trash from my experience that was how like neovim
[2595.00 --> 2601.00]  has done it and it seems to have worked like really really well well i'm really interested
[2601.00 --> 2604.20]  though you're gonna have to tell us offline we're gonna keep it we're gonna we're gonna move to we're
[2604.20 --> 2608.36]  gonna have a patreon the only thing you get to hear is about trash's side project that he's not
[2608.36 --> 2612.60]  gonna tell us on stream these are things that happen like these are things that happened before
[2612.60 --> 2617.48]  i got like severely burned out so this is like way in the past oh yeah yeah this isn't anything that's
[2617.48 --> 2623.00]  like currently happened but like at one point in my life gotcha standing there i was like i don't know
[2623.00 --> 2626.76]  was this the uh i mean i okay i'm just gonna ask a question you can just say you don't want to
[2626.76 --> 2631.00]  talk about is this from uh like type hero is this your type hero days because that you were pretty
[2631.00 --> 2635.88]  active out there and like things spin off of that i mean i still we still do like annual events as well
[2635.88 --> 2642.36]  where i have to pay people to help me do these annual things um but yeah from those days this is a great
[2642.36 --> 2648.76]  i like this question from the audience thanks vegan bot adam what's the most surprising contribution
[2648.76 --> 2654.44]  you've had to tailwind like someone externally contributing to tailwind oh there was a good one
[2654.44 --> 2660.76]  the other day i can't even remember what it was but someone like contributed like a real improvement
[2660.76 --> 2667.24]  on like the rust side of things and that feels like the most distant knowledge a consumer of tailwind
[2667.24 --> 2674.44]  would normally have um and it was like solid and solved the real problem and was all great and we merged it
[2674.44 --> 2679.16]  and uh yeah i don't know i should go and find it and see if i can pull up the exact link but is that
[2679.16 --> 2685.40]  repo in the tailwind labs organization yeah so if the tailwind css repo is like a mono repo that's got uh
[2686.12 --> 2690.92]  it's i think it's probably only one rust crate that kind of has all that stuff in it and then it's got
[2690.92 --> 2698.52]  like a bunch of different packages that kind of come together to form the whole thing when you actually
[2698.52 --> 2704.04]  uh install it oh i see it okay was that was that person who contributed name uh bacon bot by any chance
[2704.44 --> 2712.92]  that's currently in chat saying how base it is yeah yeah yeah i don't know i'll have to go and look um
[2714.28 --> 2719.96]  it was yeah i kind of would i'd be curious to get your guys like take on uh just like a challenge
[2719.96 --> 2723.72]  that we've kind of had running an open source business which is sort of like what we're trying
[2723.72 --> 2729.80]  to try and fix with the sponsorship stuff honestly it's like a it's a it's kind of a
[2729.80 --> 2737.48]  sensitive topic in some ways i guess like oh we're ready sensitive i think like the hardest thing
[2737.48 --> 2744.84]  for us as a business has been like what we sell is like ui components and templates and stuff like that
[2745.56 --> 2753.40]  um but the thing that a lot of like our biggest most excited users are excited about building are like
[2753.40 --> 2759.96]  components and templates and stuff like that so we have this shitty situation where
[2761.32 --> 2767.80]  when someone builds like a cool open source ui library with tailwind or something it's we can't
[2767.80 --> 2776.76]  like champion it because it hurts our ability to fund the project to promote free alternatives or even paid
[2776.76 --> 2782.44]  alternatives so like our commercial stuff you know and that's like been the case like for for quite a
[2782.44 --> 2787.32]  while where there's there's people doing cool work that like i want to be excited about and be able to
[2787.32 --> 2795.88]  support but like i can't literally can't because it would interfere with me like helping put food on the
[2795.88 --> 2804.12]  team's table you know at the end of the day and i really want to like figure out how we can make the
[2804.12 --> 2810.12]  project sustainable in a way where we don't feel like we're competing like with our own community at all
[2810.12 --> 2816.76]  which is why i'm i'm interested in exploring the sponsorship stuff and why we're playing with it um
[2816.76 --> 2823.24]  we're just like the bigger tailwind is the better uh for everyone and we can be like excited about that
[2823.24 --> 2829.08]  but like the reality is you have like all these people building like ai based like ui generator stuff
[2829.08 --> 2833.96]  on top of tailwind like there's tons of those tools out there and then there's like uh
[2833.96 --> 2840.28]  open source versions of things and over time like we had sort of like a first mover advantage and we
[2840.28 --> 2845.40]  benefited a lot from that and was able to sort of build up a pretty strong um business from that to
[2845.40 --> 2849.80]  keep things sustainable but that for us like peaked at like the beginning of 2023 and everything's just
[2849.80 --> 2857.32]  been like down since then um because a lot of the stuff that we're doing is like being more commoditized
[2857.32 --> 2862.04]  as more people try to build similar types of things or a lot of people are just like content with
[2862.04 --> 2868.84]  being able to ask like chat gpt or b0 or something to just spit out a pricing page for them and even
[2868.84 --> 2874.04]  if it's like not up to my standards and i want to build things that are better than that it it's good
[2874.04 --> 2878.76]  enough for a lot of people and i just sort of have to accept the reality that for those people it's good
[2878.76 --> 2885.88]  enough so i got to figure out something else to do you know what i mean um so i don't know i don't know
[2885.88 --> 2890.60]  if you guys have like any ideas on that or how that how that strikes you or if you think i just
[2890.60 --> 2896.68]  think i'm thinking about the whole thing the wrong way um but i'm like we're launching this like
[2896.68 --> 2901.24]  sponsor thing where we're trying to have like companies who use tailwinds sponsor us and in
[2901.24 --> 2906.20]  exchange for that you know it's like okay get your logo on the website whatever like everyone gets but
[2906.20 --> 2911.88]  i'm trying to find things that companies actually value a bit more than that like okay we'll we'll
[2912.52 --> 2918.04]  create like a shared slack channel so if you guys run into issues you can just like get a direct line
[2918.04 --> 2925.80]  to us and maybe that's worth something um to people or um we're also trying to do like something for
[2925.80 --> 2931.24]  individuals that we that doesn't feel like it has to compete with things other people do where
[2931.24 --> 2937.00]  it's just like 12 bucks a month and you get a bunch of perks like okay there's like a private discord
[2937.00 --> 2941.24]  that's only other people who are serious enough to be paying 12 bucks a month plus the team
[2941.24 --> 2948.60]  so you can hang out there and ask questions or stuff uh we'll make a beta documentation for like
[2948.60 --> 2952.84]  our pre-release builds available so you don't have to go like scour through prs to understand how the
[2952.84 --> 2957.80]  new features and stuff work and again that's like not that appealing to every single person but the
[2957.80 --> 2961.56]  people who are like really like excited about the new stuff that are coming out that really want to
[2961.56 --> 2966.36]  support the framework like maybe that's valuable to them the other thing is like um we've been like
[2966.36 --> 2971.88]  curating our own set of like cursor rules basically as we've been like getting better at using ai to
[2971.88 --> 2976.68]  get like ai to spit out better quality tailwind stuff so that's like another thing that we're
[2976.68 --> 2985.24]  going to throw in that people get and um even like stupid things like we made a bunch of like custom vs code
[2985.24 --> 2989.48]  themes because we made custom syntax themes for like the doc site to match our design and stuff and
[2989.48 --> 2993.72]  turn those into editor themes and people like always ask about that stuff when you post screenshots on
[2993.72 --> 2998.84]  twitter or you post youtube videos or something and it doesn't like it's not like an inherently
[2998.84 --> 3005.08]  super valuable product but it's a fun perk for people who want like an excuse to um throw you a
[3005.08 --> 3011.24]  couple bucks a month to support the project so like that's like what we're trying to do now to sort of
[3011.24 --> 3016.52]  diversify things a little bit and see what happens there and like i'd be really pumped if we could turn
[3017.64 --> 3021.72]  that version of the business into the thing that sustained it because it would just make it so much
[3021.72 --> 3027.00]  easier to be like excited about what everyone else in the community is doing but i'm just curious like
[3027.00 --> 3032.84]  from an outside perspective like does that strike you as even realistic at all you know or or what you
[3032.84 --> 3038.92]  know so i have just like a few observations just from just like using tailwind for a while and then
[3038.92 --> 3044.20]  also just observing the overall ecosystem so like i know you all released like first you had like tailwind
[3044.20 --> 3051.40]  ui and then you had catalyst right which i think is like yeah it's like part of it yeah but uh it's
[3051.40 --> 3053.24]  yeah it's it's just another
[3055.40 --> 3061.96]  folder full of code that's available to people who bought tailwind ui you know so like from my
[3061.96 --> 3067.24]  perspective it was just like i felt like that just arrived late because this is like after shad cn like
[3067.24 --> 3072.52]  blew up and everyone's like oh sheds on this and then vz came out and then they have shad cn and it's
[3072.52 --> 3078.28]  basically spitting out like all this stuff that's just radix components with tailwind yeah and even then
[3078.28 --> 3082.84]  it's like a paid thing you know so like you're already it's already just like well if there's
[3082.84 --> 3088.68]  like a free thing that people like and that's out there and like why wouldn't people choose that you
[3088.68 --> 3094.20]  know so just i get it you know yeah and like this is something i've thought about just like what would
[3094.20 --> 3099.08]  the future tell them and like where or how can you basically what you're asking now and what i've seen
[3099.08 --> 3103.72]  like in the past and i didn't it's just different now just because of like ai and the open source
[3103.72 --> 3109.64]  ecosystem was these teams effectively became consultants where they embed themselves in an
[3109.64 --> 3115.08]  organization for x amount of time get things up and running i think like even like the biggest thing
[3115.08 --> 3119.48]  that i think people struggle with is like creating a custom design system for their like overall
[3119.48 --> 3124.04]  component library like how can they write these configurations that are like scalable for their
[3124.04 --> 3128.12]  team to contribute to that's that's been an area that i've seen people struggle with because at the
[3128.12 --> 3132.92]  end of the day these tools scaffold out these components that are just you know what using the
[3132.92 --> 3139.08]  baseline tailwind classes but like theming that for like multi-tenant apps and all this other stuff
[3139.08 --> 3143.40]  is just like in my opinion like i was never really good at it and it was like kind of confusing and
[3143.40 --> 3148.04]  yeah yeah i feel like that could be like areas of like scalable design systems you could sell those
[3148.68 --> 3153.40]  um i i don't know it's it's a really hard problem just like i said because the ecosystem like
[3153.40 --> 3161.16]  just spinning out everything i see is like lm spitting out tailwind components and they look good and at the
[3161.16 --> 3164.60]  end of the day not everyone like especially for all these like founders that are just trying to spin
[3164.60 --> 3169.72]  up apps quickly they don't necessarily care about like it meets their bar you know what i mean exactly
[3169.72 --> 3175.80]  they're like this and it's yeah yeah and it's better than a lot of the like stuff that you'd see 10
[3175.80 --> 3181.16]  years ago exactly so that's like there's the ceiling i think is way higher but it still doesn't matter
[3181.16 --> 3186.68]  the what matters is that it reaches the bar you know i think like the enterprise thing is like a good
[3186.68 --> 3190.20]  target that i've seen work for people but again i'm not trying to tell you how to run your business
[3190.20 --> 3194.44]  yeah no but that's that's what i'm asking you know like i'm curious i guess like the hesitation for me
[3194.44 --> 3198.36]  on that side has always been just like kind of gets back to what we talked about at the very beginning
[3198.36 --> 3205.00]  which is like man i i don't want to set things up so that we don't even have time to work on the
[3205.00 --> 3211.88]  open source stuff because like we're working on uh all the other stuff you know it's like how can we
[3211.88 --> 3220.52]  find that right thing that gives you like how yeah i don't know it's what every open source
[3220.52 --> 3225.32]  maintainer wants obviously right it's like we're creating all this value for the world how can we
[3226.92 --> 3232.84]  how can we get paid to just do that and like make it free uh for everyone you know but it's
[3233.80 --> 3240.68]  yeah so i don't know i uh i think that's a good point though and i appreciate that advice
[3240.68 --> 3245.40]  prime do you want to go otherwise i i do i do have one but i'm glad to let you go first tj no
[3245.40 --> 3250.20]  no you first you first prime you first okay i'm gonna say something but mine's more of i guess
[3250.20 --> 3255.64]  probably a look back in time kind of thing or an observation into the past which i don't think is
[3255.64 --> 3260.76]  any helpfulness uh because i do not think you could do it today which is this is more just future
[3260.76 --> 3264.44]  advice i i really think that thinking about the licenses in which you distribute
[3265.00 --> 3270.44]  or open source code is really important like if you are planning on attempting to make money off of
[3270.44 --> 3275.00]  these things knowing and understanding your market and how you can distribute your code can be really
[3275.00 --> 3279.08]  good because i think this is where all these projects and all their failed attempts happen
[3279.08 --> 3284.12]  like you see the one with uh valky and redis and all this and they just are exploding because redis is
[3284.12 --> 3289.72]  like oh we need to make money we're gonna have to like you can no longer make money without us making
[3289.72 --> 3295.32]  money right and then it's just like oh well too late you've already had this out there and so i i do think
[3295.32 --> 3300.12]  having like i don't think there's anything wrong with having open source as a kind of like step
[3300.12 --> 3306.28]  into some sort of commercial adventure other than it's going to be extremely hard uh but i think a
[3306.28 --> 3312.04]  lot of it just comes down to licenses and expectation because the reality is that if if there was a place
[3312.04 --> 3315.72]  where tailwind you were always like hey this is what we're doing and this is how we're doing the commercial
[3315.72 --> 3321.32]  side of it and like if you're going to be a commercial vendor if you're going to create an ai that uses tailwind then you're going to have to
[3321.32 --> 3327.08]  have to you know you have to have so obviously you could never have seen the ai thing coming in 2017 so
[3327.08 --> 3331.72]  granted that's just like a free pass i mean i watched terminator 2 man i knew yeah you knew dude
[3331.72 --> 3336.84]  it's a different we all thought ai was going to be robots and that it's code generation it's just really
[3336.84 --> 3342.36]  instead it's fucking text areas man it's text areas it's just curl all the way down i know it's just
[3342.36 --> 3347.08]  curl yeah no i thought so what do you think though do you think like i guess like my reaction to that
[3347.08 --> 3352.36]  is like would redis have even like been popular at all if it didn't start with a hyper permissive
[3352.36 --> 3357.48]  license because i feel like people are so allergic to any like anything anything that smells a little
[3357.48 --> 3361.08]  like less than like i could just do whatever the fuck i want right now i don't have to worry about
[3361.08 --> 3366.84]  like getting in trouble for anything yeah i think there's a huge part like i i really this reminds me
[3366.84 --> 3373.64]  like open source today reminds me a lot of skateboarders in the 90s and the 2000s where if you were a part of
[3373.64 --> 3378.92]  that uh you would look at these skateboarders and any one of them that took like a sponsorship or
[3378.92 --> 3383.24]  became commercial you're like sell out but really like these are people that are out there putting
[3383.24 --> 3387.80]  their body on the line getting like five grand a year from sponsorships and they're ruining their
[3387.80 --> 3392.92]  body and unable to compete here in like four years and they didn't want to be a sellout and now it's
[3392.92 --> 3397.40]  like you took all your favorite people shamed them into not being able to have any form of like
[3397.40 --> 3403.08]  protected money making ability so that when they inevitably don't or unable to skateboard anymore that
[3403.08 --> 3406.44]  they actually have something at the end of the day and i kind of feel like there's a lot of that
[3406.44 --> 3410.52]  with open source still where there's this weird hesitancy for you to make money or turn it into
[3410.52 --> 3415.00]  something that's commercial and i i really think that we have this problem where we're just like
[3415.00 --> 3420.68]  we're just hoisting things on top of people to be unsuccessful and to lead to burnout because there's
[3420.68 --> 3427.16]  like this huge hesitancy for commercialism in open source and i i mean i i i personally don't have
[3427.16 --> 3431.48]  a problem with it i think if it's done right but as far as yours goes like the problem is is my
[3431.48 --> 3437.88]  thinking is so one-dimensional it always comes down to consulting education and um contributions
[3437.88 --> 3440.60]  and i just don't think contributions are a successful way to go i think like you said it
[3440.60 --> 3444.28]  just opens up a whole can of worms where you're just like individuals you should give money a you
[3444.28 --> 3449.56]  sound like wikipedia b but i just i think people are generally i was i was gonna say i've literally
[3449.56 --> 3454.28]  thrown around the idea internally at the company of like what if we put a banner on the site once a year
[3454.28 --> 3459.72]  that uh just gets people into like giving us like five dollars yeah i don't know maybe maybe it would
[3459.72 --> 3465.88]  work i don't know i do have this problem with that like whole thing i do think there is a huge value
[3465.88 --> 3470.20]  that could be some sort of like differential amount of money that you could pull in it wouldn't probably
[3470.20 --> 3475.40]  cover one and a half million but like some sort of partnership of you know these all these different
[3475.40 --> 3479.64]  education sites but the reality is that a lot of people are just going to simply like you know one
[3479.64 --> 3484.44]  could imagine fireship has a partnership with the creator of tailwind but then he could probably also
[3484.44 --> 3488.36]  just have fireship delivers it and people would buy it so he wouldn't actually ever need you to be in
[3488.36 --> 3492.20]  that partnership and so i think there's like a huge problem there and so you get back to the you should
[3492.20 --> 3497.40]  have just been famous idiot lol right which is just like not a good business plan i think it's i think
[3497.40 --> 3503.80]  it's an extremely difficult problem i do really but i i i mean the best advice i could give anyone who
[3503.80 --> 3510.76]  wanted to start an open source project yeah exactly this is what i would have done differently i did
[3510.76 --> 3517.00]  just want to throw in this last thing which is that i i do believe that specifically tailwind is an
[3517.00 --> 3521.80]  exceptionally hard problem to solve commercially because i think you will you will permanently
[3521.80 --> 3526.44]  have computers at least in the component slash additional software space like i think that that is
[3526.44 --> 3532.36]  yeah we've always like tried to figure out is there some service you know like if you build like a real
[3532.92 --> 3537.40]  framework you know that's like a real backbone of an application like there's always the hosting play
[3537.40 --> 3542.76]  or you know that type of thing like what am i going to do like oh we'll host your css file for you like
[3542.76 --> 3548.52]  that's just gonna make your website shittier like yeah it doesn't make any sense um but all that to say
[3548.52 --> 3554.20]  too like i think uh you know we still have like a great business you know like we're still profitable
[3554.20 --> 3560.76]  um but i do think we need to make some tweaks if we want to have things like keep moving in the right
[3560.76 --> 3566.84]  direction like i'm insanely grateful for like what uh opportunities like tailwind has like created for
[3566.84 --> 3573.32]  me like the fact that i've even been able to work on it full time since like 2019 i think um that's like
[3573.96 --> 3580.20]  i don't know i couldn't like ask for anything more awesome than that you know i'm like i got a really
[3580.20 --> 3587.32]  great life and uh these are interesting problems to solve you know keeps me engaged and it keeps
[3587.32 --> 3593.32]  things interesting but uh yeah it would be cool it would just be it would be really cool to figure out
[3593.32 --> 3599.24]  a way i've always wanted to be able to just focus on the open source as much as possible and uh avoid
[3600.04 --> 3604.76]  some of the conflict with the community that we kind of have with the current setup yeah so it's an
[3604.76 --> 3610.76]  interesting yeah it's yeah i've got a few i've got a few ideas that i can throw out there for you
[3611.40 --> 3617.96]  you can take them or leave them as you go um this is some general advice too for like open source
[3617.96 --> 3623.72]  projects is you got to decide first are you going to be like a vc open source project or you're going
[3623.72 --> 3627.40]  to be a lifestyle open source project right in the sense that like when you're trying to make money is
[3627.40 --> 3635.08]  it like if we made 500 000 this year am i like insanely happy or do we have to find some way to
[3635.08 --> 3639.56]  make 100 million dollars because those are like very different models of like how much money you need
[3639.56 --> 3645.72]  and the kind of like services you might need to like reach there because like you can do stuff that
[3645.72 --> 3652.04]  doesn't scale to get to 500k if you don't need to then get to five million right it's like okay we're
[3652.04 --> 3660.44]  we're chill so like i i think stuff like um if you had like you could you could try and get like
[3660.44 --> 3665.08]  some of these big corporations that are definitely doing to like sponsor an engineer it's just like
[3665.08 --> 3673.80]  literally like a one-to-one totally yeah yo google you will not miss 250k yeah right and it's like maybe
[3673.80 --> 3678.60]  if they're i don't know if google even uses tailwind so like going after because you can't you can't do that
[3678.60 --> 3682.36]  for 100 engineers but you might be able to do it for like four you know what i'm saying like you
[3682.36 --> 3688.92]  could find four companies maybe where it's like yo this guy we pay his entire salary from so and so
[3688.92 --> 3693.48]  that's that's like actually like a sick like actually good marketing they actually get something
[3693.48 --> 3698.36]  good back from that um it's like interesting so like that's something that doesn't scale but like
[3698.36 --> 3703.56]  could work because you actually are like a vital thing of a bunch of companies like stuff right maybe
[3703.56 --> 3710.28]  even like v0 you know is like yeah we could we pay for one engineer on tailwind because like yeah
[3710.28 --> 3715.24]  for sure v0 doesn't exist without tailwind and there's like that's actually like enough return
[3715.24 --> 3722.36]  that it could potentially make sense um a different one that i think like where if if you can find ways
[3722.36 --> 3728.20]  where the incentives don't depart for like the paid thing versus free is nice like if you did something
[3728.20 --> 3735.16]  where you're releasing like how i built xyz component like you because people care like about
[3735.16 --> 3740.52]  you personally because they like think this it's the famous time again you know yeah and then but
[3740.52 --> 3745.96]  you like time box the youtube video release for like three months later so like people who are on the paid
[3745.96 --> 3750.36]  plan are getting that three you know it's like you're still giving them something where for these like
[3750.36 --> 3755.16]  12 a month people or whatever for like individuals or for like corporate right that they get
[3755.16 --> 3761.24]  like these ideas where it's like yeah we actually want to know how to build this so that after v0
[3761.24 --> 3769.16]  generates something for us we can like not be lost sure yeah you know and so i do think there are some
[3769.16 --> 3775.56]  like in that field where it's like yeah you could get people to sign up for those for the early release
[3775.56 --> 3780.36]  for like getting it released in some format where there's like comments and participation from you like
[3780.36 --> 3784.44]  in the private discord it's like here's the video we released it we start a new thread
[3784.44 --> 3788.68]  that thread lasts for a month and then after that we never answer any questions on it so there's
[3788.68 --> 3793.48]  like additional ones but then you're still building stuff that like now at the end of the year you have
[3793.48 --> 3798.44]  12 sick tailwind videos about building stuff that go on youtube they're three months delayed right but
[3798.44 --> 3803.56]  like tailwind's doing better everyone benefits but like people get paid and there's like yeah
[3803.56 --> 3812.12]  um that's like education expense people can people can check bots education at corporate and sick now it's not
[3812.12 --> 3818.36]  for funsies it's like we got this education thing okay well people have education budget to spend
[3818.36 --> 3824.04]  you can put stuff in there so i think there's some like things in those verticals where like
[3824.04 --> 3829.00]  i would explore thinking like it doesn't have to scale necessarily right because you're like we
[3829.00 --> 3833.00]  want to stay at probably like eight engineers forever i don't picture you yeah yeah totally yeah
[3833.00 --> 3836.84]  there's just like there's just like a comfortable threshold that we want to be at where it's like
[3836.84 --> 3840.68]  a great living for everybody involved you know right and that's kind of like the only goal it
[3840.68 --> 3846.04]  doesn't need to it doesn't need to be scalable beyond that that can be the ceiling and that's fine
[3846.04 --> 3851.80]  right um yeah no that's good like yeah i've done like a lot of educational stuff in the past and we're
[3851.80 --> 3856.20]  doing we're working on that too so it's good to hear that you think that's a good idea like i guess
[3856.20 --> 3860.52]  like ultimately what i think we need to do is just kind of get a little bit over here a little bit over
[3860.52 --> 3864.68]  here a little bit over here a little bit over here and instead of just like having all our eggs in
[3864.68 --> 3870.04]  one basket like we kind of do right now because once the world changes and that basket gets like
[3870.04 --> 3875.88]  threatened you end up having to figure it out you know so just be a little less fragile in that sense
[3875.88 --> 3880.44]  another one is a separate issue tracker for paying people is also a classic that i've seen work really
[3880.44 --> 3886.92]  well that's a cool idea open source stuff um one you get better issues anyways because the five dollars
[3886.92 --> 3893.80]  a month is a crazy filter like yeah you filter out a lot of people who don't read you already got to
[3893.80 --> 3898.68]  fire a lot of users uh so it's better for you you get like real issues right and stuff like that
[3898.68 --> 3903.16]  anyways so there i think there's some there's some stuff there too where like we'll fix the issue it
[3903.16 --> 3908.44]  goes into open it goes into tailwind open source but it's like do you as an enterprise want to get on
[3909.64 --> 3914.44]  the issue tracker that we prioritize because we got to pay the bills like private issue tracker i
[3914.44 --> 3919.00]  think can be good too yeah can you tear out a private issue tracker can you like add various levels of
[3919.00 --> 3926.76]  uh i haven't i haven't seen that in sla to this anything's possible with the text area you know
[3926.76 --> 3934.84]  there you go these days i haven't seen anybody do that prime in like um like you could do it with tags
[3935.48 --> 3941.48]  in just like a github yeah like open source thing but there there are some other things too where like
[3942.20 --> 3946.84]  there's other options too i think of like uh per company issue trackers like if you have a high
[3946.84 --> 3952.84]  enough to your sponsorship where then they don't have to worry about like uh leaking other personal
[3952.84 --> 3958.28]  information like publicly so there is because sometimes it's like bro i just want to paste
[3958.28 --> 3964.92]  my stack trace for this i literally can't the the name is illegal for me to leak outside right so there's
[3964.92 --> 3970.20]  like some other stuff where if like for a super tier of enterprise right where it's like yo we're gonna
[3970.20 --> 3977.64]  give you super tier enterprise you like tailwind dash you know v0 dash issues and it's like the
[3977.64 --> 3982.28]  super tier one they can copy pasta indirectly yeah so there's a bunch of stuff too and also
[3983.88 --> 3987.72]  we could just be honest it's easier to talk in private than it is in public and you don't have to
[3987.72 --> 3992.76]  be like i'm making an issue for my corporation i need to make sure i'm representing them perfectly blah
[3992.76 --> 3998.04]  blah blah like for sure there's you're saving literally hours of developer time for some of these
[3998.04 --> 4003.24]  too right where it's like so there i think there's some there's some verticals there where like the
[4003.24 --> 4010.20]  support still flows back to the main product like the incentives are really nice and even like you
[4010.20 --> 4014.76]  know i don't know if any of these other oh i i know nothing about front end you know what i mean i don't
[4014.76 --> 4018.92]  know if any of these other like open source or like these other tailwind component libraries are
[4018.92 --> 4024.84]  making money but like some of them probably would like to have a straight line back to you guys yeah
[4024.84 --> 4030.04]  yeah yeah right so so yeah so i don't know those are just a few that i was sort of uh thinking yeah
[4030.04 --> 4033.56]  i like the private issue tracker one a lot because it kind of takes something that like we've sort of
[4033.56 --> 4037.48]  been like talking about with potential sponsors already which is like you know you have like a
[4037.48 --> 4043.24]  direct line with us so yeah you can raise stuff and we'll actually like notice it yes because yeah
[4043.24 --> 4047.64]  we're gonna read the message and you know that we saw it but that kind of takes that and turns it
[4047.64 --> 4052.12]  into something like a lot more concrete which is kind of cool you can give a straight up sla too like
[4052.12 --> 4056.68]  i've definitely seen that work like well like we will respond to every issue within one week like
[4056.68 --> 4061.96]  it's not going to get fixed or closed but like we promise you'll get a response within one week is
[4061.96 --> 4068.76]  like companies pay for slas right so that that works totally yeah yeah that's a great idea yeah that's
[4068.76 --> 4073.40]  that's sorry i uh that was not an mit licensed idea though so i will be taking it
[4073.40 --> 4080.92]  that was gpl uh but there is something that i mean i think tj what you're kind of what you're
[4080.92 --> 4085.80]  kind of nailing is that uh when you when you sell something from open source if i were to generalize
[4085.80 --> 4090.76]  your rule it's like you can't sell something that's easily replicatable meaning like you know
[4090.76 --> 4095.72]  if you build a tailwind ui library even if it's the best it doesn't matter someone else can build a
[4095.72 --> 4100.92]  tailwind library that's for free and maybe better than what's available so it's like it's such an easy
[4100.92 --> 4106.92]  replicatable item whereas like there is no amount of replication that you can that that can happen
[4106.92 --> 4113.88]  to have adam you know adam respond to a uh a request right like that is an that is a singular payable
[4113.88 --> 4117.96]  street and no one else can replicate that and there's something to that that is like that's where
[4117.96 --> 4123.80]  the real the real dollars are is not in not in something that can be just so easily defeated like
[4123.80 --> 4129.96]  even you know even v0 is great but v0 will only live as long as until cursor is v0 and you never
[4129.96 --> 4135.40]  need to go back to v0 because cursor is now like we have tailwind specific chat agents boom it's just
[4135.40 --> 4139.40]  like okay well it's just too replicatable right like people can just go in and destroy modes pretty
[4139.40 --> 4145.24]  quickly these days and so i just don't look at it as that like that kind of you know that's where the
[4145.24 --> 4148.76]  danger i think that's the right way to look at it i think it's like it can be perceived as like
[4149.72 --> 4153.24]  bad in a way to almost be like oh what's the thing that we can do that has like no moat where no one
[4153.24 --> 4158.20]  can compete with us but it's not because like you want to like be hyper greedy it's like i want to do
[4158.20 --> 4164.20]  something that like something we can uniquely offer so that we don't have to feel like we're in
[4164.20 --> 4170.28]  competition with our community you know um and that we can like support everything that everybody does
[4170.28 --> 4175.40]  you know the and be excited about everything everyone does oh sorry yeah no no oh yeah the other
[4175.40 --> 4179.64]  thing is like there are a lot of people who and like people who work at companies who probably want
[4179.64 --> 4187.56]  to give you guys money but they like have to have a thing that they can show accounts payable of why it is
[4187.56 --> 4194.92]  even if it's literally like it's an sla they're like sweet that's a thing that companies pay for
[4194.92 --> 4202.68]  is to have an sla awesome so like sometimes it is literally so much as like uh like the yasin rant
[4202.68 --> 4207.80]  of like stop all these robotics companies with no buy buttons on their websites right it's like so you
[4207.80 --> 4215.08]  just have to have buy tailwind enterprise and it's the same thing you know but like enterprise is 100
[4215.08 --> 4220.68]  like where you should go i am oh yeah add java somewhere in the stack for just like a very small
[4220.68 --> 4224.36]  moment and boom you're already enterprised up someone's wearing pleated pants and you're ready to
[4224.36 --> 4234.12]  go yeah no i mean the other option tailwind coin i saw that chat i saw that you know we always i play a
[4234.12 --> 4240.84]  lot of fortnite with taylor otwell okay uh it's daily daily we play i know you guys could do a skin
[4240.84 --> 4247.00]  every single day well what me and taylor were thinking is can can we do like a tailwind battle
[4247.00 --> 4253.64]  pass you know i don't even know what the hell that means dude you get a loot box up here
[4253.64 --> 4259.80]  loot crates with that was cool here's the utility classes you get for this month boys yeah exactly
[4261.56 --> 4266.44]  i love this idea of loot boxes where like when you open it it just adds a tailwind class somewhere on
[4266.44 --> 4270.76]  your thing you'd be like dude you got a loot box man you got a common m2 that sucks man
[4272.84 --> 4280.68]  yeah oh god that's good i i do love i love like a loot box of tailwind classes and there's like
[4280.68 --> 4285.32]  a leaderboard of like who's 100 of the most loot boxes in their application
[4288.52 --> 4291.24]  there's something so funny about this idea yeah
[4291.24 --> 4306.52]  uh uh t bucks you know can we like have a microtransaction market there we go where uh
[4306.52 --> 4315.08]  you buy a button for 60 t bucks right and right yeah and sometimes you pull an ultra rare button
[4315.08 --> 4324.52]  yeah exactly yeah crafted by adam himself legendary yeah yeah yeah yeah one of a kind like one of one
[4324.52 --> 4331.48]  holographic golden button oh it shows a reflection of my face using my webcam in it
[4335.16 --> 4341.72]  it's three-dimensional how did they do that yeah that's crazy or maybe you maybe you can start
[4341.72 --> 4346.52]  selling exclusive tailwind classes in the framework like you want this class you got to buy it it's
[4346.52 --> 4352.92]  yours you're the only one who can use it one of one exactly tailwind classes yeah man you start
[4352.92 --> 4359.64]  selling tailwind classes i think monopoly like oh you oh did you just land on a margin yeah i own margins
[4359.64 --> 4365.24]  one through four so like you're gonna use any of those you gotta pay me rent i put a hotel there
[4365.24 --> 4373.64]  sorry sorry sorry it's gone up in price recently dude i actually there's like a separate thing a
[4373.64 --> 4381.08]  hilarious video would be like you have a hundred t bucks and like classes are different prices and we
[4381.08 --> 4387.64]  have to replicate what's the best ui i can build like for a hundred bucks that's actually that's actually
[4387.64 --> 4393.16]  a really cool yeah that's actually a really cool battle code did that with effectively you have so
[4393.16 --> 4397.64]  much by code you can run per little robot and you have to verse each other like on a very
[4397.64 --> 4401.64]  minimalized amount of things you're running you could have the exact same thing it's like you got
[4401.64 --> 4407.80]  a tailwind budget you got to build this site no css only tailwind like that that is it you can do no
[4407.80 --> 4413.00]  other things like who can build the best site only tailwind 100 classes or less best best site
[4413.00 --> 4418.44]  there's a character limit on a class yeah yeah that'd be fun a css roguelike deck builder that could be
[4418.44 --> 4422.76]  pretty good too dude like dude imagine you get five car you have to build a component you get five cards
[4422.76 --> 4429.64]  you're like dude i got two margins one padding oh dude that is actually so good that is so good
[4429.64 --> 4434.84]  man god that's funny oh my gosh there we go that's a great idea that's actually really you can make
[4434.84 --> 4439.64]  dozens of dollars if we just go all in on entertainment you know like maybe that's really
[4439.64 --> 4446.28]  the play just be entertainers yeah just get famous idiot yeah all comes back have you thought about
[4446.28 --> 4449.88]  working five hours a week and paying for the rest of the week so you can do open
[4454.28 --> 4459.64]  you know what you actually honestly like this is really real advice um if you just like vibe code
[4459.64 --> 4465.00]  a sass startup you'll make 50 grand a month and so if you just buy that then you can sell it for 10
[4465.00 --> 4469.64]  to 15 and then boom like you've just paid for tailwind like a huge amount
[4469.64 --> 4478.60]  dude dude two sass startups that's 100 grand a month four that's 200 grand like dude it's pretty
[4478.60 --> 4484.12]  easy spend the weekend i would personally i'd rather get one tomato plant because after you grow one
[4484.12 --> 4489.96]  tomato plant those grow more tomatoes from the tomatoes you can play more tomato plants before you know it
[4489.96 --> 4496.12]  i have infinite money so have you guys ever thought about like vibe coding us a sass app generator
[4499.00 --> 4502.04]  i'm coding i don't think i can say anything right now
[4506.44 --> 4507.40]  something's in the works
[4509.24 --> 4512.28]  exactly that's what that means
[4514.20 --> 4519.16]  well i'm excited to see what you guys do i think yeah thanks yeah cool so yeah i hope you guys find
[4519.16 --> 4523.64]  lots of success by the way i'm very happy that you recognized everything that everybody went
[4523.64 --> 4529.56]  through from like 2008 to 2017 and made it into something that we all now use because i think
[4529.56 --> 4537.80]  that anyone who programmed the old web i had left so i'd go float left clear fix right boom boom get
[4537.80 --> 4544.84]  this one close yeah clear m small you know you know bg blue right and i just had like all these like
[4544.84 --> 4549.00]  named classes that were just like mine but they're only for me and nobody else could know them
[4549.00 --> 4553.80]  them and i'd make all my websites based off like just this like series of words that i had memorized
[4553.80 --> 4557.48]  and so now it's just like hey this is a series of words that you have memorized but now everybody has
[4557.48 --> 4564.44]  the same ones memorized and it just makes life so much better and you know yeah no it's been a hard
[4564.44 --> 4570.68]  battle uh getting uh it's it's to the point now where like there's not it's not controversial really
[4570.68 --> 4577.48]  anymore but for a while there it was uh it was pretty controversial so um yeah i'm glad that it's
[4577.48 --> 4581.64]  taken off and then people are into it it definitely has solved the problem for me i'm definitely uh
[4582.28 --> 4586.76]  yeah i don't know for me it's like there's this one blog post by nicholas gallagher who he's the
[4586.76 --> 4590.20]  guy created normalized css i don't know if you guys remember that and he worked at twitter for a long
[4590.20 --> 4595.96]  time i think he might work at instagram now i can't remember but he wrote this one blog post called like
[4595.96 --> 4601.00]  about html semantics and front-end architecture and it was the first thing i ever read that like finally
[4601.00 --> 4606.92]  just gave me permission to write classes this sort of way it's just like some smart person says this is
[4607.88 --> 4612.60]  conceptually the right way to do things is that classes actually should be presentational
[4612.60 --> 4618.60]  um and that's the only way to build scalable websites and i was like oh man now i can do that
[4618.60 --> 4626.20]  i thought that was a crime you know and uh yeah so nicholas man nicholas really created tailwind
[4626.20 --> 4632.12]  uh which he probably probably loses sleep over he's like where's my paycheck yeah
[4633.40 --> 4640.28]  should have done mit license that one so true all right well hey i appreciate you coming on
[4640.28 --> 4645.48]  especially on such short notice because i literally watched the video that all of this spawned from on
[4645.48 --> 4650.44]  monday and sent you a text message potentially late monday being like hey you want to come up on
[4650.44 --> 4654.84]  wednesday and you're just like let's do it let's do it especially thanks for having me on dude this
[4654.84 --> 4659.00]  is fun today right you're launching your sponsors thing today that's why we did it today because i
[4659.00 --> 4664.76]  was like ah i can't go on this podcast and like not have it done so it's done now it's on the website
[4664.76 --> 4670.20]  if anyone is a tailwind super fan and wants to sponsor you can just go to oncs.com sponsor check it
[4670.20 --> 4675.64]  out let me know if any of that resonates if it doesn't we'll uh we'll keep iterating on it but
[4675.64 --> 4680.36]  hopefully some people think there's uh some cool stuff in there and you want to support i
[4680.36 --> 4684.60]  know it a lot of people have told us like i'd like to give you more money but like you don't give us
[4684.60 --> 4687.88]  a way to give you more money because you just charge once for this thing and then there's nothing else
[4687.88 --> 4693.88]  you have for sale so this gives those people a chance to do it no obligation uh but you know if
[4693.88 --> 4701.40]  you love tailwind and you want my cursor rules that's really the their pull here then uh consider uh
[4701.40 --> 4705.32]  consider signing up for this like insider thing that we're doing but yeah dudes thanks for having me on
[4705.32 --> 4711.40]  man it's been fun uh i've never got to chat with most of you guys i met prime at uh laricon and we
[4711.40 --> 4717.40]  enjoyed uh a nice dinner together but uh it's good getting to connect with the rest of you and yeah
[4717.40 --> 4723.32]  sure thanks again trash is the real winner in this group so he was so excited i was like i want to
[4723.32 --> 4730.28]  talk to him i was really hoping trash you were just gonna pull out like a random component and be
[4730.28 --> 4736.60]  like this is not working so i'm on my virtual cam just check this out man like it is killing me or
[4736.60 --> 4743.00]  just just complain and just be real mean i was like oh so funny good do that sounds good does that
[4743.00 --> 4747.88]  actually debugging deep end do you ever get people where you like you walk up you're at a conference
[4747.88 --> 4752.68]  which i'm like oh yeah you created tailwind hey why doesn't this work
[4752.68 --> 4759.08]  not not not too bad honestly i've had a little bit of that stuff like that but not in like a
[4759.08 --> 4763.32]  hilarious way usually usually they're like legit questions that we can have good discussions about
