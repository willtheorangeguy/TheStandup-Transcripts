[0.00 --> 1.64]  Welcome to The Stand-Up, everybody.
[1.86 --> 3.28]  This week is a special week.
[3.34 --> 6.12]  It is the Thanksgiving special of The Stand-Up,
[6.16 --> 10.68]  where we are going to do some more lighthearted and nice heartwarming stories
[10.68 --> 14.16]  as opposed to the general rigmarole of tech and some of the negativity.
[14.34 --> 16.24]  So I hope everybody's ready to have a good day.
[16.90 --> 20.26]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20.74 --> 21.58]  Anyway, sorry.
[21.66 --> 24.26]  I just want to give a special shout-out to our Spotify listeners.
[24.50 --> 25.88]  Thank you very much for being there.
[26.68 --> 27.70]  Appreciate you guys.
[27.70 --> 30.32]  Okay, so today we are going to be talking over three points
[30.32 --> 32.78]  about things that we are thankful for.
[32.98 --> 38.72]  And I would love for Trash to really go on a very long and very thankful rant
[38.72 --> 41.36]  because we just don't hear enough from Trash as it is.
[41.74 --> 45.22]  So Trash, I know this is part of your sponsor obligation.
[45.38 --> 48.42]  Can you please tell me the snack you're most thankful for and why?
[51.16 --> 53.38]  Well, there's going to be a recency bias here right now
[53.38 --> 56.48]  because right now I have onions.
[56.72 --> 57.12]  Okay.
[57.12 --> 58.86]  And then I just finished the gummy bears.
[59.16 --> 60.62]  Oh, Harry Bo Gold Bears!
[61.08 --> 62.42]  We got like three in here left.
[63.90 --> 65.74]  I am thankful for Funyuns
[65.74 --> 69.40]  because my lips didn't get itchy today when I ate them.
[69.96 --> 71.36]  Those chewies that Teej has.
[71.74 --> 73.90]  Yeah, I'll eat one in honor of you right now, Trash.
[74.20 --> 76.98]  But I also just finished a bag of Doritos before the call started.
[76.98 --> 80.10]  So really, so Doritos is where it's at.
[80.74 --> 84.14]  So Doritos, if someone's in the crowd, if you're a software engineer at Doritos,
[84.32 --> 90.02]  I would love a collaboration of some sort where you just give me free Doritos forever.
[90.02 --> 92.92]  And I'm thankful for you.
[93.48 --> 94.38]  I don't eat them as much.
[94.48 --> 96.04]  I went to Jiu-Jitsu at 6 a.m., okay?
[96.04 --> 96.34]  So.
[97.48 --> 97.84]  Okay.
[98.28 --> 98.58]  Okay.
[98.58 --> 105.00]  I have no idea what Judo at 6 a.m. has to do with you eating three separate bags of snacks.
[105.54 --> 107.18]  Because you have to earn it.
[107.18 --> 110.96]  You have to therefore eat a bag of gummy bears, a bag of Doritos, and now some Funyuns.
[111.04 --> 112.10]  I don't think that's how it works.
[112.36 --> 114.68]  You have to earn your food.
[114.70 --> 114.90]  The burn?
[115.36 --> 116.06]  Yeah, you gotta earn it.
[116.06 --> 118.94]  Way, way, way, way back before any of you were born,
[119.66 --> 125.24]  there was a John Belushi sketch on Saturday Night Live
[125.24 --> 130.30]  where he was parroting one of those like Olympic athletes,
[130.88 --> 135.44]  endorses Wheaties commercials that they always do.
[135.44 --> 138.22]  And I'm sure now they have Olympic athlete endorses whatever.
[139.22 --> 142.62]  And it is very much like what Trash just did.
[142.92 --> 145.86]  He's basically, it shows him, and of course, he's overweight.
[146.16 --> 147.58]  Like, John Belushi's a pretty big guy.
[147.72 --> 151.06]  But it shows him like sort of somehow winning like these like, you know,
[151.12 --> 153.80]  100-yard dashes and all these sorts of things.
[154.06 --> 157.80]  And then he just shows him with this big plate of chocolate donuts at breakfast.
[158.06 --> 163.18]  And he's just like, that's why little chocolate donuts have been on my training table
[163.18 --> 164.18]  since I was a kid.
[164.18 --> 165.76]  And he's like pounding them down.
[166.36 --> 169.34]  This sounds a little bit like Trash's idea.
[169.46 --> 172.62]  He's like, look, I need peak performance when I go to judo.
[172.68 --> 175.58]  I'm not going to get in the ring if there is a ring in judo.
[175.64 --> 179.56]  I'm not going to get on the mat without a whole bag of Funyuns
[179.56 --> 183.08]  to power me through this, you know, grueling competition.
[183.32 --> 183.88]  I didn't eat five gummy bears before I got on the mat.
[184.82 --> 185.18]  Nice.
[185.74 --> 188.00]  If I may, though, Haribo gold bears are legit.
[188.70 --> 190.40]  Haribo gold bears are awesome.
[190.72 --> 191.22]  I just want to say that.
[191.22 --> 192.30]  Let me tell you my secret.
[192.40 --> 195.00]  So I wake up so early that I don't want to wake up my kids.
[195.04 --> 195.94]  So I don't brush my teeth.
[196.04 --> 198.20]  So I make my breath smell better with candy.
[198.92 --> 203.78]  So while I'm driving to Jiu-Jitsu, I'm eating candy and I'm rinsing my mouth out with water
[203.78 --> 205.10]  while I'm driving.
[206.38 --> 208.30]  What is happening?
[208.80 --> 211.98]  You can just eat an apple which is good for your teeth and it cleans your teeth.
[212.04 --> 213.14]  I'm allergic to fruit.
[213.22 --> 215.08]  My lips get itchy when I bite an apple.
[216.42 --> 220.62]  In the Saturday Night Live writer's room, they were like, what if we had a part where
[220.62 --> 225.86]  John Belushi talks about swishing candy around in his mouth with water to freshen his breath?
[225.92 --> 227.84]  And they were like, what the hell do you mean?
[227.90 --> 229.18]  Like, no one does that.
[229.24 --> 230.30]  That doesn't make any sense.
[230.76 --> 233.98]  Meanwhile, Trash is like, actually, it's my main technique.
[233.98 --> 238.04]  Trash, I will say I've done that with like a mint.
[238.16 --> 240.38]  Not gummy bears, but like a mint in the morning.
[240.84 --> 241.84]  Like on my way to basketball.
[241.84 --> 241.98]  I don't have mints.
[242.04 --> 242.74]  I don't really like mints.
[242.78 --> 243.78]  I just like regular candy.
[244.34 --> 244.52]  Okay.
[244.88 --> 245.48]  Or sometimes...
[245.48 --> 245.70]  Regular?
[245.98 --> 247.48]  Wait, what do you mean regular candy?
[248.76 --> 253.00]  Sometimes I'll get a Twix bar and I'll bite the Twix bar like it's a mouthpiece and I'll
[253.00 --> 254.22]  just let my teeth sit in there.
[258.86 --> 262.56]  And then it kind of just like, then it like naturally like melts into my mouth and then
[262.56 --> 263.22]  you just gotta lick your teeth.
[263.98 --> 265.36]  Don't you gotta stop, man.
[265.38 --> 266.78]  You're too old for this kind of stuff.
[267.06 --> 272.32]  So basically what's going on here is Trash is winning these judo matches by default because
[272.32 --> 278.56]  his breath is like a weird combination of horrible morning mouth, rotten Twix, and like
[278.56 --> 279.34]  Funyuns.
[279.42 --> 283.90]  And it just like breathes out onto the other contestants and they just wilt like on the mat.
[283.90 --> 285.50]  Smells better than morning breath.
[285.58 --> 286.26]  That's all I'm saying.
[286.50 --> 286.80]  All right.
[286.86 --> 288.10]  Hey, is that HTTP?
[288.84 --> 289.92]  Get that out of here.
[290.00 --> 291.52]  That's not how we order coffee.
[291.52 --> 294.44]  We order coffee via SSH terminal.shop.
[294.56 --> 294.78]  Yeah.
[294.84 --> 295.80]  You want a real experience?
[296.04 --> 297.16]  You want real coffee?
[297.32 --> 300.46]  You want awesome subscriptions so you never have to remember again?
[300.72 --> 306.08]  Oh, you want exclusive blends with exclusive coffee and exclusive content?
[306.20 --> 307.16]  Then check out Kron.
[307.46 --> 308.60]  You don't know what SSH is?
[308.60 --> 311.08]  Well, maybe the coffee's not for you.
[312.64 --> 315.76]  Terminal coffee in hand.
[316.68 --> 318.54]  Live in the dream.
[320.72 --> 321.60]  All right.
[321.74 --> 322.28]  All right.
[322.40 --> 324.96]  Well, that's it for the stand up.
[325.08 --> 326.46]  Thanks everyone for joining us.
[328.40 --> 329.46]  Oh my gosh.
[329.60 --> 330.28]  All right.
[330.40 --> 330.90]  I don't even know.
[331.02 --> 331.32]  I don't even.
[331.44 --> 332.86]  Josh, we might have to take that one out.
[332.94 --> 333.28]  All right.
[333.28 --> 335.70]  All right.
[335.76 --> 336.98]  So actually, let's get started.
[337.18 --> 338.70]  So I'm going to start with Casey.
[339.62 --> 343.78]  Since you're known for the best rants with the best compliments or the best insults.
[343.82 --> 349.12]  So we should start with you, which is what tech project or what tech project or person
[349.12 --> 352.72]  are you excited to say something positive and nice about that you're thankful for?
[353.84 --> 354.48]  Oh man.
[355.26 --> 360.42]  Again, I'll echo Trash's thing that there may be some recency bias here.
[360.92 --> 362.74]  I thought it was going to be about snacks.
[362.74 --> 365.12]  But, uh, candy in your mouth.
[365.34 --> 370.04]  No, thankfully, this is actually, I don't do that.
[370.52 --> 372.28]  Not a thing that I would do.
[372.82 --> 382.14]  Um, I, I like Teej reach for the incredibly controversial, uh, breath mint when I want my breath to smell
[382.14 --> 390.92]  better or like mouthwash as opposed to like Funyuns and gold bears and a Twix bar, a Twix
[390.92 --> 395.80]  bar mouthpiece, which, you know, call, call me old fashioned, right?
[395.84 --> 396.66]  I'm pretty old.
[396.80 --> 398.70]  I just, I don't think of those things.
[399.66 --> 400.98]  Uh, yeah.
[400.98 --> 406.20]  I was going to say, uh, definitely recency bias here for sure.
[406.20 --> 410.12]  So, you know, this just happens to be something that happened literally last week.
[410.46 --> 417.76]  Uh, but, uh, Vjekoslav Kriacic released the new version of FilePilot, which is even more
[417.76 --> 420.42]  awesomer than the previous version of FilePilot.
[420.42 --> 423.60]  Uh, and so like, I have been loving that.
[424.32 --> 425.98]  It's, it's just absolutely fantastic.
[426.14 --> 430.64]  It saves me from Windows File Explorer, which is rapidly circling the drain and was never
[430.64 --> 431.64]  that good to begin with.
[431.96 --> 435.92]  And so I am, I am a huge fan of that product, this, uh, this product.
[436.04 --> 438.10]  I was a customer like day one when he released it.
[438.16 --> 440.00]  It's still technically just a beta version.
[440.00 --> 444.30]  Um, but it's already so much better than the existing File Explorer.
[444.90 --> 448.74]  Uh, you know, Microsoft's team of like 50 people or whatever.
[448.74 --> 453.36]  I don't even want to know how big the org chart is that's responsible for File Explorer.
[453.74 --> 458.84]  But, but Vjekoslav by himself kind of just, uh, took care of it and it's, it's great.
[458.96 --> 462.58]  Um, and it's worse that they've been doing File Explorer since 3.1.
[462.78 --> 463.22]  Yeah.
[463.22 --> 464.96]  And they lost to one guy.
[465.72 --> 469.26]  Uh, so, so that's pretty awesome.
[469.26 --> 474.86]  And, uh, and it's also, it's, it's my kind of thing too, which is that, you know, uh,
[475.06 --> 477.50]  I, I like to focus on what I like to focus on.
[477.50 --> 480.26]  Like if I'm working on whatever I'm working on, like, that's what I want to do.
[480.30 --> 483.64]  I don't, I'm not, you know, we've had this when we talked about Git, right?
[483.70 --> 486.92]  Everyone got mad at me because I'm like, I don't really want to think about my version
[486.92 --> 487.22]  control.
[487.22 --> 487.46]  Right.
[487.76 --> 488.64]  Same with my file Explorer.
[488.74 --> 492.78]  Like, I don't want to learn, like, I don't want to go learn total commander or whatever
[492.78 --> 493.18]  it is.
[493.18 --> 495.24]  Like, I don't want to learn a new file Explorer.
[495.24 --> 499.64]  I just want someone to replace the file Explorer I already use with something that basically
[499.64 --> 504.28]  works the same way, but it's just better in all regards, like way faster, way zippier.
[504.44 --> 507.12]  And when I need a feature, it's just there, right?
[507.14 --> 509.40]  It's like, oh, I just want to search my whole drive for something.
[509.48 --> 510.44]  It can just do that.
[510.70 --> 510.96]  Right.
[510.96 --> 511.00]  Right.
[511.62 --> 514.00]  And so it's, it's my kind of product.
[514.00 --> 519.42]  It doesn't, it doesn't like make me, it doesn't make me do a bunch of work to get the benefit.
[519.42 --> 523.98]  It's just, it's, they, you know, he's put in the work to make it very seamless for me
[523.98 --> 526.02]  to just kind of use in the same way I'm used to.
[526.12 --> 528.02]  And so, and he's, and he keeps doing that.
[528.02 --> 532.40]  Like as this beta goes on, he's adding more and more stuff that like, oh, did people,
[532.58 --> 534.58]  you know, need this feature from the old file Explorer?
[534.68 --> 539.54]  Cause it's just, you know, even if it's a stupid thing because they're used to it, he like
[539.54 --> 540.70]  takes the time to put that in.
[540.78 --> 541.80]  And I really appreciate that.
[542.44 --> 543.06]  It's lovely.
[544.08 --> 545.40]  I also have been watching that.
[545.48 --> 546.20]  Is it worth it?
[546.20 --> 546.68]  Because it's what?
[546.76 --> 550.50]  $50 for a yearly basic license.
[550.50 --> 552.02]  And then there were some other license as well.
[552.10 --> 557.18]  Is it, you're telling me that you have no problem spending the money for the quality that you get out?
[557.42 --> 558.78]  Oh, absolutely not.
[559.28 --> 561.92]  So I think the price points is it's 50 bucks.
[561.92 --> 564.08]  If you just want it, the current one.
[564.72 --> 566.92]  And also you get updates for a year or something like that.
[566.92 --> 570.36]  And then it's $200 if you just want it infinitely.
[571.14 --> 576.16]  So if you want it for all time and every update that will ever be done for the next like 10 years or something.
[576.98 --> 583.82]  I literally plunked down the 200 day one because I desperately just, I am so sick of file Explorer.
[583.96 --> 590.34]  Cause there's so much, it, it, it was just, it got to the point where it's like kind of unusably or like even like a joke,
[590.34 --> 591.66]  kind of how bad it was.
[591.66 --> 600.80]  And so like, I was like, for, you know, for a professional developer, $200 for something that I'm using every day is like pretty close to free.
[600.80 --> 602.90]  When you think about how much it costs.
[603.04 --> 606.74]  Like when you think about how much I have to pay for my computer and how much I have to, you know,
[607.06 --> 610.96]  consider like how much I'm paying people who do work for, on our behalf.
[610.96 --> 617.10]  $200 for a perpetual license was like zero to me because, you know, for a core tool like that,
[617.16 --> 621.50]  there's a couple of the things that I pay that kind of money for without really caring or thinking about it much.
[621.50 --> 622.06]  Cause they're so good.
[622.12 --> 625.36]  Reaper is the other one, the audio package, right?
[625.48 --> 627.54]  So there's a couple of things that are just no brainer purchased for me.
[627.58 --> 628.80]  And file palette was one of those.
[629.44 --> 631.82]  And so far it's, it's been living up to that.
[631.86 --> 633.50]  And like I said, it hasn't even hit version one yet.
[633.50 --> 636.76]  And I'm already, I already feel like I got my money worth money's worth.
[637.44 --> 637.58]  So.
[637.96 --> 638.82]  That feels good.
[638.82 --> 642.88]  So it does in a day and age of software, never feeling that good.
[643.26 --> 644.72]  That feels pretty good to hear.
[645.24 --> 645.98]  It does.
[646.06 --> 646.50]  It does.
[646.54 --> 649.44]  And there's not that many things I can think of that I can say that about.
[649.50 --> 652.42]  Like a lot of times I'm using stuff and I'm just kind of crabby about them.
[653.50 --> 654.84]  So it's pretty great.
[655.12 --> 656.66]  And, and I hope it continues.
[656.82 --> 659.56]  I'm looking forward to, to the, the full release.
[659.92 --> 663.58]  Cause yeah, I mean, it's, it's already, it already meets all my needs basically,
[663.58 --> 668.54]  but I know there are some things that it doesn't do as well that like he's still working on, for example.
[668.54 --> 668.82]  Right.
[668.86 --> 675.60]  And so for other people's use cases, I think as he gets there, I think it's going to be a no brainer from an increasingly large number of people too.
[676.26 --> 676.76]  All right.
[676.76 --> 677.44]  I'll go next.
[677.86 --> 685.36]  So I guess for me, since I'm going to go with the person that I feel very thankful for, it's going to be kind of a unique one.
[685.36 --> 693.68]  So this year, starting in April or May, I started my first company or technically my second company.
[693.68 --> 697.52]  Cause my first startup actually fizzled out and died, you know, 15 years ago.
[697.52 --> 704.70]  But my second startup is involving running a company with TJ, Began, Lindsay, and Josh.
[705.08 --> 710.56]  And we brought in a bunch of other people, including Xanus and all of these other, you know, a lot of people have been helping out.
[710.56 --> 726.08]  And I feel very thankful to have people to work with again, because a lot of, a lot of streaming or content creation is largely a individual sport in the programming space and the tech space, because you can't really collaborate for a day on tech.
[726.08 --> 732.00]  It just doesn't really work that way for the most part, because usually you're building a long product and that takes a long time to actually do anything.
[732.48 --> 735.74]  Whereas like video games, at least you can play with your friends, you know, from time to time.
[735.74 --> 736.98]  You're like, Hey, let's play call of duty.
[736.98 --> 740.02]  Even though you hate your life because you're playing call of duty, at least you got to do it with your friends.
[740.02 --> 742.78]  And so it's just like, I don't get that opportunity very often.
[742.78 --> 754.64]  And so this feels very nice to be able to attempt to create super cool, what we at least think are super cool advertisements and stuff for companies and other fun events and all the stuff we're doing.
[754.64 --> 756.18]  As like a team.
[756.26 --> 757.62]  So it's been very fun for me.
[757.64 --> 761.40]  So that's my big thankful thing is for people coming alongside of me.
[761.44 --> 765.24]  And then my other two would be, of course, for trash and Casey for joining us on the standup.
[765.40 --> 769.08]  This is kind of like year one attempt at, at like a podcast.
[769.40 --> 772.80]  And honestly, it's a lot more work than I ever thought a real podcast would be.
[772.88 --> 775.20]  And I'm barely doing the work that I need to do for it.
[775.22 --> 777.48]  And it's just like, I can't believe you guys continue to keep showing up.
[777.52 --> 784.62]  And honestly, I feel very thankful every, like every single week I'm reminded of my shortcomings and how thankful I am when I do the intro.
[784.64 --> 786.38]  And you guys go, fumbled it again.
[786.66 --> 788.78]  You know, try 37 will be better.
[788.86 --> 789.22]  Don't worry.
[789.28 --> 790.14]  You got a big guy.
[790.40 --> 792.94]  It's just like, damn, you guys are too nice for sticking around.
[793.86 --> 794.92]  It's the other way around.
[795.04 --> 795.74]  I love that.
[795.86 --> 798.74]  I tease you about the intro because that's like what's so much fun.
[798.86 --> 799.90]  I love this podcast.
[799.98 --> 800.62]  Are you kidding me?
[800.66 --> 801.84]  I'm not sticking around.
[802.00 --> 804.70]  I'm like, I show up here because I'm excited every week.
[804.70 --> 805.28]  I love it.
[805.78 --> 806.26]  It's great.
[806.40 --> 813.52]  And also like the other thing too is I feel like somehow like the audience is also great, which makes no sense to me.
[813.62 --> 819.84]  I mean, the internet is like, you know, a place I don't really like to go that often, but the audience for this show is fantastic.
[820.22 --> 822.18]  So that's kind of amazing.
[822.18 --> 826.64]  Like you, you put together the best audience too somehow, which is, which is pretty great.
[826.82 --> 829.80]  I have no, I like, I genuinely have no idea why that is.
[829.90 --> 835.12]  I've had multiple people be like, how do you have such a positive YouTube and Twitter section?
[835.62 --> 835.76]  Yeah.
[835.76 --> 836.34]  I don't know.
[836.40 --> 839.20]  I like, I genuinely have no idea why this happens.
[839.20 --> 847.12]  I think it's because I try to be like, I'm a generally friendly person, but there's plenty of friendly people that don't have very nice audiences.
[847.36 --> 850.76]  So it's like, I don't know why I got the lucky role in this one.
[850.82 --> 852.14]  So, Hey, also thank you audiences.
[852.52 --> 854.76]  Really appreciate all of you guys for all the nice comments.
[855.94 --> 857.40]  And I ban a few people every day.
[857.48 --> 858.26]  So that also helps.
[858.92 --> 859.76]  It's a little bit.
[859.76 --> 861.50]  I was going to say, it's a few.
[862.58 --> 864.86]  You know, there's always a few bad apples.
[866.08 --> 869.18]  There was a massive wiener in my chat an hour ago, but I didn't ban that guy.
[869.20 --> 872.34]  It was funny that someone took the time to paste an ASCII wien in there.
[873.14 --> 874.16]  Oh, what can you do?
[874.26 --> 874.90]  It's Twitch chat.
[875.04 --> 875.22]  Yeah.
[876.40 --> 878.14]  Not really Twitch chat if that doesn't happen.
[878.56 --> 879.14]  Yeah, true.
[879.28 --> 879.92]  It's not Twitch chat.
[879.94 --> 881.34]  Bro fell off, you know?
[881.76 --> 884.26]  Not even getting a wien in the first 30 minutes, he fell off.
[884.92 --> 885.68]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[887.56 --> 890.44]  They used to have a metric like TTP, right?
[890.96 --> 891.16]  Right.
[891.16 --> 895.04]  It was, that was for, you know, anything where you had user generated content.
[895.36 --> 897.10]  It would be like, what's the TTP on that?
[897.18 --> 899.02]  It's like, yeah, you know, it's like.
[899.20 --> 899.86]  30 seconds.
[900.24 --> 900.48]  Yeah.
[902.96 --> 905.18]  I was going to say the same thing as Prime, but I was muted.
[905.40 --> 907.26]  So I don't know if that didn't come through.
[907.26 --> 916.54]  I'll go, I'll go.
[916.62 --> 921.24]  I am, in all seriousness, I have been having a lot of fun doing this whole terminal thing
[921.24 --> 922.70]  and trying out a bunch of new stuff.
[922.70 --> 927.28]  And, you know, we did like the tower and a bunch of crazy stuff that I'm wearing it right
[927.28 --> 927.62]  now.
[927.62 --> 931.30]  I mean, thank you for Adam Eunice and his beautiful artwork.
[933.68 --> 937.48]  I had two people in mind for my tech people I'm thankful for.
[937.74 --> 944.38]  I'll go opposite of recency bias because it's a long time ago for me, which makes sense.
[944.46 --> 946.10]  That would be the opposite of recency bias.
[946.10 --> 949.44]  Thanks for clarifying just in case.
[951.58 --> 955.32]  So I'll pick the first person is Zix.
[955.66 --> 958.42]  Zix was a long time contributor of Neovim.
[958.42 --> 964.28]  I don't know what Zix is up to these days, but he helped a lot on my very first PR to
[964.28 --> 964.76]  Neovim.
[965.18 --> 971.84]  He was a very straightforward Eastern European developer who did a lot of great review for
[971.84 --> 973.76]  me and was very, very helpful.
[974.34 --> 980.62]  I was a very dumb college kid, but who was trying really hard to be nice and to accept
[980.62 --> 981.86]  some new feedback and stuff.
[981.92 --> 986.72]  And he gladly gave me a lot of feedback over and over on a PR.
[986.72 --> 990.62]  And that was sick because I was like, this is so much better than anything else that I've
[990.62 --> 991.26]  ever had before.
[991.44 --> 998.94]  So that was a big thing for me probably in my overall career is just that direct feedback.
[999.08 --> 1003.76]  I got about some code that I was writing as like a really stupid, probably junior in college,
[1003.76 --> 1005.92]  like only a year out of starting programming.
[1006.02 --> 1009.00]  I didn't, I didn't do any programming until the end of my sophomore year.
[1011.34 --> 1012.40]  So that'd be the first person.
[1012.48 --> 1016.66]  The second person in that same sort of group would be Justin Keys, who is like the,
[1016.72 --> 1018.14]  benevolent dictator for Neovim.
[1019.94 --> 1025.70]  And just learned a lot from him as well over the years about like managing projects and
[1025.70 --> 1030.24]  how to set direction, how to say no to things, which is probably one of the most important
[1030.24 --> 1035.16]  things for any project or like any, any longterm goal that you're trying to do.
[1035.26 --> 1036.76]  People always want more things.
[1036.86 --> 1038.86]  They want you to say yes to everything, but that doesn't work.
[1038.92 --> 1040.12]  You've got to say no sometimes.
[1040.12 --> 1046.90]  And yeah, so those would be the two people that I'm very thankful for in, in tech.
[1047.42 --> 1049.94]  So I'm not super familiar with Neovim.
[1050.02 --> 1052.94]  That's the thing that people use when they, when they can't figure out how to use Emacs,
[1053.02 --> 1053.24]  right?
[1053.44 --> 1054.50]  Am I right about it?
[1054.50 --> 1056.66]  We get stuck and we can't go anywhere.
[1056.80 --> 1057.10]  Right.
[1057.22 --> 1057.52]  Okay.
[1057.62 --> 1057.90]  Okay.
[1057.96 --> 1058.28]  Got it.
[1058.28 --> 1063.20]  I got in during my, during my first internship and I haven't left.
[1063.28 --> 1065.86]  I still have the same laptop that they gave me from work.
[1065.86 --> 1067.02]  I haven't exited the session.
[1067.26 --> 1068.86]  So it's like, what can you do?
[1069.14 --> 1070.56]  I used Neovim before it was cool.
[1070.80 --> 1072.18]  So that's all.
[1072.18 --> 1072.68]  Oh yeah, trash.
[1072.82 --> 1074.04]  What year did you start?
[1074.12 --> 1074.98]  If we're going to play that game?
[1075.14 --> 1075.50]  Oh, geez.
[1075.50 --> 1075.80]  Just kidding.
[1075.86 --> 1077.22]  I'm not going to war with you on that.
[1077.58 --> 1078.48]  Original gangster.
[1080.08 --> 1085.30]  I used it before I joined like Twitch and stuff, but I didn't realize how like Mimi, like,
[1085.30 --> 1088.06]  I don't even know everyone's just like been by the way and I was like, what's happening?
[1089.50 --> 1090.74]  I was like, I just use this.
[1090.74 --> 1091.32]  Cause I like it.
[1091.32 --> 1092.14]  I was like, is this the thing?
[1092.38 --> 1098.14]  I think I can probably guarantee that I used VI probably before most of you were born.
[1098.14 --> 1102.32]  And I can also guarantee that I had no, I probably had to like reboot the machine.
[1102.32 --> 1103.48]  Cause I didn't know how to exit.
[1103.78 --> 1107.74]  That's probably what happened is my guess about the original time.
[1107.74 --> 1107.98]  Right.
[1108.04 --> 1112.38]  Cause like the first time you type VI, you have no idea how you exit VI.
[1112.84 --> 1114.30]  That's my recollection anyway.
[1114.64 --> 1114.98]  Yes.
[1115.30 --> 1116.16]  Okay.
[1116.30 --> 1117.06]  Let me, let me go.
[1117.14 --> 1119.70]  Now that I, I got the snack, uh, thank yous out of the way.
[1120.00 --> 1125.26]  So I have one person and then one piece of tech or a group of people, I guess.
[1125.48 --> 1126.76]  Obviously thankful for you all.
[1126.94 --> 1129.10]  I don't think I don't really make content anymore.
[1129.10 --> 1133.94]  So this is kind of like my, my way to still do it, but really enjoy it.
[1133.94 --> 1136.30]  So I really like just showing up and being able to talk to you all.
[1136.42 --> 1141.00]  I think it's really cool to be in a group of, be friends with a group of people that are,
[1141.20 --> 1144.18]  I wouldn't say like so influential, but super, like super smart.
[1144.18 --> 1146.52]  And you know, very giving with their intelligence.
[1146.52 --> 1148.48]  So I think that's a really cool thing to be a part of.
[1148.98 --> 1153.94]  Um, as far as like other people, my teammate, Chris, he's on my current team at Netflix.
[1154.58 --> 1156.10]  Um, probably one of the smartest people.
[1156.32 --> 1156.46]  Yeah.
[1156.54 --> 1159.64]  Netflix, by the way, probably one of the smartest engineers I've ever worked with.
[1159.64 --> 1163.78]  Um, so I do a lot of platform work and he's like really library API oriented.
[1163.78 --> 1165.82]  Um, so he always keeps me in check.
[1165.82 --> 1166.48]  He's really good.
[1166.48 --> 1169.42]  Like his PRs, like no ego, which is the best part.
[1169.42 --> 1174.40]  Cause at first I was like, oh man, it's like, he might like, uh, he might sniff out my, uh,
[1174.64 --> 1175.78]  my awfulness immediately.
[1175.78 --> 1177.60]  But luckily that wasn't the case.
[1177.60 --> 1179.40]  And like, I've grown like so much as engineers.
[1179.40 --> 1180.90]  That was the gummy bears.
[1183.16 --> 1183.98]  What's that smell?
[1184.08 --> 1186.66]  Oh, that's just my, uh, that's my Twix mouthpiece, sir.
[1190.20 --> 1191.90]  No, but seriously, like this dude's like, it's funny.
[1191.90 --> 1194.64]  Cause he doesn't, he's not really like an AI person either.
[1194.64 --> 1196.94]  So like, you know, it's just homegrown code.
[1196.94 --> 1199.46]  Whenever I look at his PRs, everything's just like written so well.
[1199.90 --> 1202.06]  Um, so I think I've been like picking all that stuff up.
[1202.52 --> 1205.70]  Um, so really thankful to be on a, on a team with this person.
[1205.70 --> 1207.20]  And I've also known him before Netflix too.
[1207.56 --> 1209.26]  I remember he actually convinced me to apply.
[1209.26 --> 1211.04]  We were on a beach in Hawaii cause he lives in Hawaii.
[1211.46 --> 1212.40]  He's like, you should just apply.
[1212.40 --> 1213.86]  And I remember I just, I was like, okay.
[1213.86 --> 1218.60]  I just went to my laptop, applied to like five jobs on the Netflix career site and then
[1218.60 --> 1219.64]  got a call like the next day.
[1219.64 --> 1220.76]  And then the rest was history.
[1221.02 --> 1225.10]  And then somehow we ended up being on the same team eventually like two years after the fact.
[1225.10 --> 1226.46]  So super cool.
[1226.70 --> 1229.32]  Um, last one, I would say open code.
[1229.48 --> 1233.90]  Um, I really want them to kind of win like this AI space.
[1233.90 --> 1236.44]  I don't really like these other people.
[1237.20 --> 1241.58]  Um, so if anyone's going to win it, if anyone's going to win it, I hope it's Dax and his friends
[1241.58 --> 1244.04]  and being a very likable guy.
[1247.22 --> 1248.56]  He just tells it how it is.
[1248.60 --> 1251.14]  So I really hope they, uh, they go very far.
[1251.14 --> 1252.16]  It looks like they're doing very well.
[1252.16 --> 1253.82]  So super happy for them.
[1254.00 --> 1257.12]  So what is for those of us who have no idea, what is open code?
[1257.12 --> 1263.40]  It's just like, uh, another CLI based or terminal based thing to use your models.
[1263.40 --> 1263.66]  Right.
[1263.76 --> 1265.58]  So it's like cloud code and I don't know.
[1265.58 --> 1266.72]  I don't know what it is.
[1266.72 --> 1267.22]  Yes.
[1267.34 --> 1271.92]  Casey, what it does is it uses like LSP and other tools to be able to understand your project
[1271.92 --> 1276.08]  and send all that information off to an AI and to be able to get changes, but it's all
[1276.08 --> 1278.36]  done by the CLI and it's like a really nice interface.
[1278.80 --> 1280.40]  It's really easy to use it.
[1280.40 --> 1282.22]  It, it, you can use any model you want.
[1282.22 --> 1287.26]  So it's not, it's not like clod offering clod or open AI offering open AI.
[1287.26 --> 1289.56]  It's just a third party offering all the models.
[1289.78 --> 1294.36]  Use it how you want, uh, for my little AI tool that I'm using right now, I actually use it
[1294.36 --> 1299.36]  to query out and get changes back into Vim to ask for like implementations and stuff.
[1299.92 --> 1304.88]  And is this meant for like end users or is it more for people who are developing an AI tool?
[1305.02 --> 1307.54]  They use it and they script it to like do stuff.
[1307.54 --> 1310.54]  Like what, what is the, what, who, who is it targeted at exactly?
[1311.40 --> 1315.10]  Software developers in, in general, you can like, so you can use it.
[1315.34 --> 1318.92]  It has like an API where you can do a bunch of stuff with it, but it has a full like 2E
[1318.92 --> 1319.76]  experience.
[1320.02 --> 1322.16]  They're working on the 2E version and other stuff too.
[1322.64 --> 1329.52]  But also the, the guys that we did the coffee shop with like Adam, Dax and David are the
[1329.52 --> 1330.34]  guys that we did that.
[1330.64 --> 1336.86]  So it's kind of like a cursory cursor ish sort of thing, longer term sort of.
[1336.86 --> 1337.02]  Yeah.
[1337.18 --> 1338.46]  Just in the terminal basically.
[1338.68 --> 1338.78]  Right.
[1339.08 --> 1339.26]  Yeah.
[1339.26 --> 1341.22]  Well, he said, they said they're working on a GUI version as well.
[1341.34 --> 1341.46]  Yeah.
[1341.46 --> 1342.90]  They have a GUI version that they're working on.
[1342.90 --> 1344.46]  So that's, that's sort of cursory.
[1344.56 --> 1344.76]  Right.
[1344.84 --> 1345.30]  I mean, yeah.
[1345.98 --> 1349.94]  And I, and it's like, it's open source and they want you to bring your, you can bring
[1349.94 --> 1351.98]  your own model and your own keys and a bunch of other stuff.
[1352.18 --> 1352.32]  Yeah.
[1352.32 --> 1352.52]  Yeah.
[1352.64 --> 1354.68]  You can even do local models and stuff like that.
[1354.68 --> 1357.04]  So it's not bound to some sort of big corpo.
[1357.64 --> 1358.50]  You don't want to be.
[1360.24 --> 1361.56]  It's open source by the way.
[1361.96 --> 1362.22]  Yeah.
[1362.72 --> 1363.22]  By the way.
[1363.28 --> 1363.38]  Cool.
[1363.38 --> 1366.46]  Shout out Dax.
[1366.88 --> 1367.96]  Shout out Dax.
[1368.24 --> 1369.40]  What a silly boy.
[1369.96 --> 1370.84]  So true.
[1371.42 --> 1372.44]  So true.
[1373.28 --> 1373.80]  All right.
[1374.02 --> 1375.70]  We're going to, we're going to change gears a little bit.
[1375.70 --> 1381.70]  It's something about your current job slash situation that you're thankful for.
[1384.36 --> 1386.64]  So let's inverse order TJ or trash.
[1386.74 --> 1387.16]  Why don't you start?
[1387.80 --> 1389.44]  Oh, back to back snake style.
[1389.62 --> 1389.80]  Nice.
[1389.80 --> 1392.22]  So I still work at Netflix, by the way.
[1392.92 --> 1395.50]  One thing I'm thankful for is work life balance.
[1395.98 --> 1401.66]  Everyone on my team is more is, I think we're all like in the same age span part of our lives.
[1401.72 --> 1403.16]  I mean, like there's a lot of parents and stuff.
[1403.16 --> 1407.80]  So whenever, you know, something goes wrong with the kids, everyone's like, oh yeah, do kids first.
[1407.96 --> 1408.80]  Go, go handle it.
[1408.82 --> 1409.48]  We'll take care of it.
[1409.48 --> 1411.56]  So we're all very supportive in that sense.
[1411.66 --> 1412.58]  Work life balance is amazing.
[1413.04 --> 1414.16]  The work I'm doing is pretty cool.
[1415.36 --> 1421.36]  It's not just like, I mean, I don't really, it's just writing tools for engineers, which is like my favorite thing to do.
[1422.12 --> 1423.58]  So I'm super stoked on that.
[1423.58 --> 1428.70]  And to be honest, the cool part is like, if I do get bored, I can just switch teams if I want to.
[1430.44 --> 1432.12]  And, you know, the job market's kind of scary.
[1432.24 --> 1436.50]  So if I ever get bored again, I'll just switch to another team and then keep going with that.
[1436.66 --> 1438.18]  So I'm super thankful for where I'm at.
[1438.20 --> 1440.40]  I'm like very fortunate that I do have a job.
[1440.40 --> 1442.18]  I do know like the job market's pretty insane.
[1443.32 --> 1450.00]  So I'm just glad that, you know, I can still provide for my family and, you know, at the same time, enjoy the work that I'm doing.
[1450.18 --> 1453.90]  Because I know what it feels like to not like the work you're doing.
[1453.94 --> 1457.82]  And it's really soul sucking to the point, like, it doesn't matter how much money you make, you're going to quit.
[1458.72 --> 1460.58]  So I'm thankful I'm not in that spot as well.
[1460.72 --> 1462.98]  So super thankful for sure.
[1465.08 --> 1465.44]  Nice.
[1465.44 --> 1465.88]  Nice.
[1466.56 --> 1481.68]  For me, I would say the thing that I like a lot about what we're doing these days is like I get to try and flex like a lot of different like creative muscles that I wouldn't normally get to do at like a real programming job.
[1481.68 --> 1483.38]  Like I still get to code, which is fun.
[1483.38 --> 1502.12]  But like we get to go think of like crazy ideas or like what we're going to talk about for podcasts or like events or like thinking up a cop drama show set in a programming universe and go film it for a few days with our friends is like really cool.
[1502.12 --> 1518.58]  And I like getting getting to do that because that's like pretty, pretty hard to find ways that you get to like try out to do very like creative goofy stuff and moonshot ideas or like host a 24 seven marathon stream in a water tower is like that.
[1518.82 --> 1526.12]  When I started programming, that was not on my career trajectory path where I was like, where do I see myself in five years?
[1526.12 --> 1531.20]  I didn't answer when I started that epic, like probably in a water tower.
[1532.56 --> 1538.36]  Wearing like a wearing like medieval clothing in a water tower surrounded by cameras.
[1539.96 --> 1543.62]  And they're looking at you like, I'm sorry, what?
[1543.72 --> 1545.64]  Like that's just what I don't know.
[1545.76 --> 1547.00]  That's what I see.
[1547.06 --> 1549.28]  When I close my eyes, that's what it looks like.
[1549.56 --> 1551.36]  And there's a guy there with a mustache.
[1551.70 --> 1553.00]  I don't know what's happening.
[1553.00 --> 1555.22]  Oh man.
[1555.36 --> 1564.94]  And then I guess like on that same note, very thankful, you know, for, for my wife's support of going and trying this whole thing out.
[1565.00 --> 1572.42]  She was excited for us to go do crazy stuff, which is kind of wild of quitting like a real programming job and, and trying to do some of this stuff.
[1572.78 --> 1576.02]  And even, even my parents, you know, shout out mom and dad.
[1576.16 --> 1579.28]  They were like, you should go for it, which is cool.
[1579.28 --> 1580.76]  My dad even has a Twitch account.
[1580.76 --> 1582.02]  He sometimes says hi in chat.
[1582.12 --> 1583.58]  So it's like, it's cool.
[1584.16 --> 1584.24]  Yeah.
[1584.24 --> 1586.36]  He's confused still about the situation.
[1586.36 --> 1586.82]  I think.
[1587.74 --> 1589.66]  I would never want my parents in my stream.
[1589.78 --> 1590.40]  It would be terrible.
[1591.12 --> 1591.52]  They'd be ashamed.
[1591.52 --> 1591.86]  That's true.
[1591.86 --> 1592.62]  You tell them great.
[1593.06 --> 1593.78]  They'd be ashamed.
[1594.46 --> 1596.28]  They never see this room at the house.
[1596.34 --> 1596.90]  Do they trash?
[1597.30 --> 1597.80]  Oh, never.
[1599.24 --> 1599.80]  All right.
[1599.88 --> 1600.68]  Casey, you're up.
[1600.68 --> 1605.30]  So I guess that that's kind of a tough one to answer.
[1606.30 --> 1610.24]  Cause we don't really talk about most of the stuff that we've worked on.
[1611.12 --> 1613.36]  So that makes it a little bit difficult.
[1613.36 --> 1619.78]  Um, the thing that I happen to be spending the majority of my time on right now actually
[1619.78 --> 1621.16]  is, is a lot of fun.
[1621.48 --> 1628.58]  Um, but it's not an actually announced project, but, uh, we get to do a lot of work with, uh,
[1628.78 --> 1635.20]  like in with, with musicians in a music studio, which was kind of a completely new experience
[1635.20 --> 1637.92]  for me since I'd never had the opportunity to do that before.
[1637.92 --> 1640.78]  And that's been absolutely amazing.
[1640.78 --> 1645.74]  Like it's, it's really, really, really cool to see, uh, how that sort of stuff gets done.
[1646.34 --> 1651.20]  And also to work with people who are very, very good at, uh, you know, playing music,
[1651.20 --> 1658.64]  which is also kind of something you, you know, uh, there's only so many cities in the world.
[1658.64 --> 1662.00]  You can probably even be in where you could do that.
[1662.20 --> 1667.40]  I mean, it's like, you know, it's like LA, Nashville, New York city.
[1667.40 --> 1672.30]  You know, there's a few places you can go, uh, you know, probably New Orleans, I'm guessing,
[1672.30 --> 1675.96]  and where you could have like really great access to really great musicians, stuff like
[1675.96 --> 1676.20]  that.
[1676.62 --> 1679.42]  Seattle happens to be one of them and that's just pure luck.
[1679.58 --> 1683.66]  So it was really cool that we happened to be doing a project where, you know, we could,
[1683.78 --> 1688.88]  uh, we could experience that and actually do that locally and not just have it be an outsourced
[1688.88 --> 1690.66]  thing that we never get to see.
[1690.80 --> 1694.60]  So that's been really awesome, but I can't really talk about it much beyond just saying that
[1694.60 --> 1695.96]  that's happening at the moment.
[1695.96 --> 1699.48]  So that's nice.
[1702.14 --> 1703.34]  Hey, that's nice.
[1703.64 --> 1703.86]  All right.
[1703.86 --> 1704.34]  What about you?
[1704.56 --> 1704.82]  Prime?
[1704.82 --> 1705.56]  What about you?
[1705.82 --> 1707.62]  We're all waiting for you to say something.
[1708.12 --> 1708.70]  I know.
[1708.74 --> 1709.08]  I know.
[1709.14 --> 1709.46]  I know.
[1709.52 --> 1714.66]  Um, so I, the, I mean, trying to think of things alternatively to what TJ said, cause I
[1714.66 --> 1715.48]  also was on mute.
[1715.62 --> 1718.62]  Just, I mean, I said it right before TJ, but he just happened to say it first.
[1718.86 --> 1720.20]  Uh, I saw your lips moving.
[1720.34 --> 1720.76]  I know.
[1720.82 --> 1721.08]  Yeah.
[1721.08 --> 1721.12]  Yeah.
[1721.16 --> 1725.22]  No, my, my, my thankfulness was just going to a different school in Canada.
[1725.22 --> 1725.76]  That's all.
[1726.00 --> 1729.90]  Uh, but you wouldn't know her, but you wouldn't know her, but like a separate one.
[1729.90 --> 1735.36]  That's something that I'm really becoming thankful for is learning, uh, just due to
[1735.36 --> 1739.44]  this job and having quote unquote freedom, which is like enough freedom to kind of hang
[1739.44 --> 1745.30]  yourself very easily is, uh, just being able to figure out the things that I can excel at
[1745.30 --> 1748.70]  and being able to have the opportunity to work on them.
[1749.40 --> 1753.54]  And, uh, you know, there's this, um, I, I always thought I was really good at the old,
[1753.54 --> 1757.48]  uh, online reacts, watching a video and giving my hot take thought I was pretty good at those
[1757.48 --> 1757.76]  things.
[1758.32 --> 1762.52]  And then, uh, God decided that I didn't need to use my voice anymore regularly.
[1762.56 --> 1767.76]  So for the last year, I've been not being able to speak more than, uh, something like
[1767.76 --> 1770.54]  five hours a week without a decent amount of pain.
[1770.54 --> 1776.96]  Um, so learning how to do offline reacts and learning how to kind of take articles and
[1776.96 --> 1781.56]  synthesize them and all that has been something that's been, uh, an unknown rewarding treat
[1781.56 --> 1786.48]  in my life as time has gone on going from something I really didn't like and feeling like things
[1786.48 --> 1790.44]  were very defeated or hopeless because, you know, being someone who's supposed to be on
[1790.44 --> 1794.02]  the internet, but not being able to be on the internet was a very tragic situation.
[1794.36 --> 1800.52]  And so for that to happen, I was, uh, I have been very thankful that people seem to say,
[1800.54 --> 1801.30]  yes, we like that.
[1801.74 --> 1806.20]  And it, that allows me to continue on this crazy adventure because it was either that
[1806.20 --> 1807.84]  or I probably would have had to consider quitting.
[1807.84 --> 1809.46]  And so it feels very good.
[1810.74 --> 1819.12]  I have a question, um, a little bit tangential to this that I hadn't considered until you guys
[1819.12 --> 1819.84]  just said it.
[1819.84 --> 1826.50]  Um, and that is what can kids today do?
[1827.66 --> 1834.48]  Because if you told someone in school that your girlfriend was from Canada nowadays, they'd just
[1834.48 --> 1836.30]  be like, Oh, you, what's your Facebook page?
[1836.30 --> 1837.12]  Or like, what's your tick?
[1837.20 --> 1839.18]  What's, you know, what's your TikTok handle or whatever?
[1839.30 --> 1840.38]  Like, you know, I mean, you must.
[1841.40 --> 1842.52]  So you got nothing.
[1842.52 --> 1847.98]  Like, there's no way, like the globalization of like the social network seems to have created
[1847.98 --> 1848.24]  it.
[1848.32 --> 1853.38]  So do you just say a random handle that they like you, that's just set to private and
[1853.38 --> 1854.46]  that way they can't tell?
[1854.54 --> 1859.44]  Or do you create, do you actually go create an alt and post a picture on there and set it
[1859.44 --> 1859.84]  to private?
[1859.84 --> 1861.48]  So that, and you just say, Oh, it's that one.
[1861.48 --> 1862.36]  Like what happened?
[1862.44 --> 1863.86]  How do you lie about this now?
[1864.00 --> 1864.34]  Easy.
[1864.56 --> 1865.20]  She's Amish.
[1868.16 --> 1870.28]  You stole that from chat.
[1870.46 --> 1871.64]  I'm putting it in the record.
[1873.08 --> 1876.94]  At criteria, type that out first.
[1877.24 --> 1877.52]  Okay.
[1878.34 --> 1883.74]  So, so my girlfriend from Canada is now my, my girlfriend from Pennsylvania is basically
[1883.74 --> 1884.38]  what you're saying.
[1884.38 --> 1884.70]  My Amish girlfriend.
[1885.00 --> 1885.30]  Okay.
[1886.12 --> 1886.32]  Yeah.
[1886.46 --> 1887.40]  My Amish girlfriend.
[1887.40 --> 1888.86]  That's a TLC video.
[1889.12 --> 1889.84]  I'm pretty sure.
[1889.84 --> 1891.34]  My Amish girlfriend.
[1891.34 --> 1891.58]  Yeah.
[1891.58 --> 1891.94]  Yeah.
[1891.94 --> 1892.24]  Yeah.
[1892.24 --> 1892.56]  Yep.
[1892.66 --> 1892.90]  Yep.
[1893.90 --> 1895.92]  The learning channel.
[1896.32 --> 1896.56]  Yeah.
[1896.62 --> 1896.90]  Right.
[1897.10 --> 1897.42]  Yes.
[1897.58 --> 1897.78]  Yeah.
[1897.96 --> 1898.24]  All right.
[1898.24 --> 1899.96]  Well, thank you for catching me using chat.
[1900.06 --> 1900.44]  All right.
[1901.28 --> 1904.40]  We're going to round this off with our, your most recent programming project.
[1904.40 --> 1907.60]  That's made you very happy that you're happy you've got to do.
[1907.76 --> 1911.82]  And maybe this will give some, some of the audience members, some ideas as to what they
[1911.82 --> 1915.08]  could pursue or things that could spark their interest and be able to do themselves.
[1915.08 --> 1918.06]  Cause it's the number one question I get, which is what should I program?
[1918.06 --> 1921.54]  I always try to give them the standard advice of what do you like to do?
[1921.96 --> 1924.40]  And so now it's our turn to tell them what we like to do.
[1924.44 --> 1927.12]  And maybe that can help jog some of the ideas out.
[1928.48 --> 1930.96]  I guess I'm going to go re reverse snake ordering again.
[1930.96 --> 1933.04]  So I guess I go, I go first again this time.
[1933.16 --> 1933.68]  Yeah, you go.
[1933.92 --> 1934.08]  Yep.
[1934.18 --> 1934.46]  All right.
[1934.46 --> 1938.42]  Uh, so I have a bunch of projects that I've been doing just as of recent.
[1938.42 --> 1943.90]  And so I'm very thankful to be able to program a little C game for an ESP 32 for my son.
[1943.90 --> 1945.52]  I feel like that's a very fun one.
[1945.58 --> 1949.74]  And I really enjoyed, uh, being kind of more memory constrained by the way, the last time
[1949.74 --> 1951.96]  I tried to build it, which was yesterday, I ran out of memory.
[1951.96 --> 1955.90]  So now I have to fall back to PS Ram and do some things differently, which makes me sad.
[1956.16 --> 1958.10]  Can't achieve 60 frames a second without it.
[1958.10 --> 1962.58]  So I got to figure out a new alternative, but, uh, the other thing I'm very thankful
[1962.58 --> 1968.28]  for is just being able to build a few projects in my past involving tree sitter and, uh, and
[1968.28 --> 1972.82]  some LSP stuff, and then continuing to be able to use things I've already built and continue
[1972.82 --> 1976.88]  to build new things that just are interesting to me or ways in which I think can help make
[1976.88 --> 1979.72]  me enjoy programming even more in the day and age of, uh, AI.
[1980.64 --> 1983.84]  And so it's just, I've been very thankful for those, those two things.
[1983.84 --> 1990.06]  So, uh, most recent thing that I coded that I was really excited about was definitely PMC
[1990.06 --> 1999.30]  trace, which is like kind of a thing that I've wanted for, I mean, at least a decade and which
[1999.30 --> 2002.48]  was previously thought to be completely impossible.
[2002.96 --> 2012.14]  So, uh, this is thanks largely to, uh, Martins Mosaico who, uh, actually for the very first
[2012.14 --> 2015.70]  time, you can actually go hear an interview with him.
[2015.76 --> 2020.26]  He's, he doesn't do very much public stuff, uh, like that.
[2020.36 --> 2024.14]  He, he's always answering people's questions on forums or on stack overflow.
[2024.14 --> 2026.14]  It's like 50% of the answers come from Martins.
[2026.76 --> 2031.76]  Uh, but, uh, Martins Mosaico recently, there's a, there's a podcast called the WooCash podcast,
[2031.76 --> 2037.32]  which does interviews with like various, like hardcore programming, low-level people, uh, and
[2037.32 --> 2037.92]  stuff like that.
[2038.32 --> 2043.56]  And, um, you can go, you can, if you want to post a link in chat, you can go see an interview
[2043.56 --> 2049.02]  with him, but he figured out very laboriously.
[2049.02 --> 2053.26]  And this like is incredibly, incredibly difficult to figure out.
[2053.26 --> 2056.30]  And to the best of my knowledge, he's the only person who ever cracked it.
[2057.16 --> 2064.18]  He was able to figure out that actually, despite it not seeming like it was possible, you actually
[2064.18 --> 2071.50]  could get programmatic, like via the API, not via the command line in some special Microsoft
[2071.50 --> 2079.46]  utility, but actually programmatic access to the performance monitoring counters on windows,
[2079.46 --> 2084.86]  the actual CPU performance monitoring counters that are built into the CPU, like how many L2
[2084.86 --> 2087.38]  cache misses there are or something like that.
[2087.54 --> 2087.66]  Right.
[2088.98 --> 2093.32]  And so he was able to figure out that through the right combination of ridiculous things you
[2093.32 --> 2098.26]  could do that are kind of under-documented in the actual API, you actually can get them.
[2098.72 --> 2101.26]  And it's incredibly fragile with how you had to do it.
[2101.26 --> 2106.54]  So it was like this, it's just, it's so ridiculous, all the voodoo you have to do to make it happen,
[2106.54 --> 2107.54]  but he figured it out.
[2107.82 --> 2114.38]  And so we had that to start with and he and I worked on it, um, kind of moving it from there
[2114.38 --> 2120.02]  to something that could actually do sort of the Holy grail of what you want, which is the ability
[2120.02 --> 2123.70]  to put a start and an end marker in a piece of code.
[2124.12 --> 2130.98]  And to say, I want these specific literal performance counters, meaning they're not just
[2130.98 --> 2135.24]  the ones that are predefined, which, you know, previously seemed like the only way you could
[2135.24 --> 2141.68]  really do it in windows, but actually any kind of hex stuff you might've loaded into the CPU to get
[2141.68 --> 2142.44]  that performance counter.
[2142.44 --> 2144.52]  We actually got it to that point.
[2144.52 --> 2150.76]  And so now with PMC trace, I can literally do this on my windows machine, which was never
[2150.76 --> 2151.60]  possible before.
[2151.94 --> 2154.30]  You can literally just go like here to here.
[2154.44 --> 2158.98]  Tell me exactly how many of this specific CPU performance counter trigger happened.
[2159.40 --> 2162.18]  And that's been so amazingly convenient.
[2162.18 --> 2164.58]  Cause now it's like, I never have to guess anymore.
[2164.72 --> 2170.34]  I can just be like, Hey, tell me how many full width SIMD ops got dispatched in this window.
[2170.34 --> 2174.26]  And it's like this many, which was like data you could never get up before.
[2174.76 --> 2177.44]  So that's been incredibly, incredibly awesome.
[2177.72 --> 2179.04]  I had so much fun.
[2179.96 --> 2182.62]  It was kind of a puzzle to try and figure out how to get it to work.
[2183.16 --> 2188.98]  And I'm also just on the thankful front, extremely thankful to Martin's for having cracked that
[2188.98 --> 2196.90]  particular egg because like until he got that first bit working, no, we like nobody thought
[2196.90 --> 2198.88]  you could even do any of this.
[2198.88 --> 2200.90]  Right.
[2200.90 --> 2201.94]  And so that kind of led to this whole thing, which was great.
[2202.30 --> 2205.14]  So what you're trying to say is you're thankful for Hiram's law.
[2205.94 --> 2206.72]  What's okay.
[2206.90 --> 2208.26]  Is this a new trash law?
[2208.60 --> 2214.40]  No, no, we've, we've talked about this one, but this is all observable behaviors will be
[2214.40 --> 2215.54]  dependent on in an API.
[2215.96 --> 2221.00]  Like eventually you can craft enough crazy APIs together that you unlock something that they
[2221.00 --> 2221.56]  didn't mean to.
[2221.62 --> 2222.16]  And it's like too bad.
[2222.20 --> 2224.30]  That's now part of the hidden API.
[2224.30 --> 2227.88]  So it sounds like this was a hidden API through enough calls.
[2228.26 --> 2230.30]  Yeah, actually it totally is.
[2230.48 --> 2236.12]  And in fact, like it, it's down to the, like, this is an undocumented call that we're making
[2236.12 --> 2242.14]  sort of like, like we pack a bunch of stuff into a struct that's undocumented that like
[2242.14 --> 2246.16]  we reverse engineered the bit patterns for and crap like that.
[2246.16 --> 2248.12]  But like, that is how it had to be done.
[2248.42 --> 2255.32]  Now, mind you, if they just, they could have just provided this, like it's something everyone
[2255.32 --> 2255.86]  wants.
[2256.10 --> 2258.14]  If you're on Linux, you can just do it.
[2258.28 --> 2259.38]  It's just available.
[2259.82 --> 2260.34]  Common Linux W.
[2261.18 --> 2261.50]  Yeah.
[2261.50 --> 2268.72]  So like why they just refused, I don't know, especially because it's requires admin privileges
[2268.72 --> 2269.34]  to access.
[2269.34 --> 2270.82]  So it's not a security hold.
[2270.82 --> 2273.16]  Like this is something that you need it.
[2273.28 --> 2275.44]  You need to run under elevated privilege to do it.
[2275.52 --> 2279.86]  So it's not like it was something that was, you know, creating some kind of weird, unique
[2279.86 --> 2280.56]  security scenario.
[2280.66 --> 2281.78]  So I don't know.
[2281.88 --> 2284.34]  I I've asked the Colonel team for it indirectly.
[2284.34 --> 2286.76]  Of course, they don't talk to anyone really.
[2286.86 --> 2290.76]  So I can't ask them directly, but I've asked many times for them to please have these and
[2290.76 --> 2291.90]  they never would do it.
[2292.66 --> 2294.72]  And so this was just the only way to do it.
[2294.76 --> 2296.00]  And now we've we've got it.
[2296.04 --> 2297.06]  And I'm I'm psyched.
[2297.24 --> 2297.78]  It's been great.
[2298.48 --> 2299.14]  My turn.
[2299.66 --> 2299.88]  Yeah.
[2299.88 --> 2300.08]  Yeah.
[2300.08 --> 2300.56]  Yeah.
[2300.56 --> 2300.76]  Yeah.
[2300.76 --> 2300.88]  Yeah.
[2301.28 --> 2301.72]  Okay.
[2301.78 --> 2302.44]  I'll go.
[2302.64 --> 2311.36]  I'll say I had a lot of fun working on Mordoria with everybody and building a lot of our
[2311.36 --> 2316.46]  game and also learning a lot from Casey, which was very fun about different animation stuff.
[2316.46 --> 2321.76]  That was probably one of the projects that I had the most fun recently working on.
[2322.18 --> 2325.22]  And then I guess slightly more recently than that.
[2325.30 --> 2331.86]  That's been fun, too, is trying out effect effect type scripts for those who for those
[2331.86 --> 2332.56]  who are fans.
[2332.80 --> 2335.20]  And shout out to especially Kit Langton.
[2335.68 --> 2339.04]  Thank you, Kit, for coming down the stream and teaching me a lot of stuff about it.
[2339.48 --> 2340.44]  It was pretty cool.
[2340.84 --> 2342.00]  So I'm enjoying joy.
[2342.10 --> 2343.20]  Enjoying that experience.
[2343.20 --> 2347.68]  I'm going to become even more of a wizard than trash at TypeScript types.
[2348.00 --> 2348.96]  I'm going to learn effect now.
[2349.78 --> 2350.26]  Oh, yeah.
[2350.26 --> 2350.62]  Oh, yeah.
[2350.70 --> 2351.90]  Oh, I'm going to learn it even more.
[2351.90 --> 2354.02]  I'm going to be thankful for how much more I know than you about it.
[2354.02 --> 2355.52]  I'm going to affect harder now.
[2356.22 --> 2357.16]  Oh, no.
[2357.94 --> 2362.10]  I look forward to you two having Twix bars stuck in your mouth going like, I don't
[2362.10 --> 2362.76]  want more of a TypeScript.
[2363.12 --> 2363.96]  I don't want a TypeScript.
[2364.48 --> 2365.26]  I don't want a TypeScript.
[2365.48 --> 2368.36]  Can you all just try it, please?
[2368.68 --> 2369.54]  I'm going to next time.
[2369.72 --> 2369.96]  We'll get them.
[2370.00 --> 2371.00]  We'll all get Twix bars.
[2371.00 --> 2373.54]  We'll do the stand-up with Twix.
[2373.90 --> 2374.92]  Get the fun-sized ones.
[2375.58 --> 2381.14]  Our breath will smell like beautiful caramel and nougat or whatever it is.
[2381.20 --> 2381.94]  I don't know what Twix has.
[2382.10 --> 2386.76]  But I'm currently on the Brian Johnson mostly no sugar approach right now for the
[2386.76 --> 2387.14]  holidays.
[2387.64 --> 2388.62]  I will literally die.
[2389.04 --> 2391.28]  Can I be straight with you guys for a second here also?
[2391.98 --> 2393.88]  Because we never discussed this.
[2393.90 --> 2394.20]  What are you usually?
[2394.70 --> 2395.86]  We never discussed this.
[2396.74 --> 2398.44]  Are you just lying the whole time?
[2398.54 --> 2399.30]  What are you trying to do?
[2399.30 --> 2402.00]  Oh, the program encounters didn't actually exist.
[2402.08 --> 2402.70]  You just made that up.
[2403.86 --> 2406.28]  Can I be real with you guys for a second?
[2406.70 --> 2406.88]  Yeah, of course.
[2407.06 --> 2407.50]  Yeah, lay down on me.
[2407.68 --> 2408.08]  Lay down on me.
[2408.08 --> 2409.70]  Because we haven't talked about this.
[2409.78 --> 2410.50]  This is a huge...
[2410.50 --> 2412.86]  Like, this has been the elephant in the room.
[2413.28 --> 2413.48]  Okay?
[2413.56 --> 2413.94]  Oh, okay.
[2413.94 --> 2419.74]  So, I went down to LA that time and I went to the Tower Stream thing.
[2420.20 --> 2420.48]  Yep.
[2421.12 --> 2425.42]  And I show up, ladies and gentlemen, who are watching right now.
[2426.94 --> 2429.84]  This is programming, okay?
[2429.84 --> 2438.66]  If you went back to the 80s or 90s and you went and watched a Hollywood movie where there
[2438.66 --> 2441.00]  was a programmer in it, right?
[2441.70 --> 2448.26]  The dude is 250 pounds and he has, like, Cheetos, like, on him or whatever, right?
[2448.32 --> 2449.24]  Like, that's just what...
[2449.24 --> 2449.42]  I've seen Jurassic Park.
[2449.66 --> 2450.94]  That's just what that means.
[2451.12 --> 2452.92]  He obviously hasn't seen Swordfish.
[2453.74 --> 2454.64]  Okay, well, yeah.
[2455.10 --> 2459.10]  There was occasionally other ones where they're like, the hacker is cool, like in Die Hard
[2459.10 --> 2460.16]  or Swordfish, sure.
[2461.54 --> 2462.24]  So, anyway.
[2463.28 --> 2468.88]  So, you know, traditionally speaking, you're not necessarily expecting it to be a paragon
[2468.88 --> 2470.14]  of nutrition, whatever.
[2471.40 --> 2478.68]  But I show up to the Tower Stream and I bring a box, two boxes, actually, of cupcakes.
[2479.32 --> 2481.58]  Now, these are really good cupcakes.
[2481.58 --> 2486.76]  There's a place in LA called Susie Cakes that makes really, really good cupcakes.
[2486.96 --> 2487.52]  They're delicious.
[2487.86 --> 2488.88]  I'm not just saying that.
[2489.36 --> 2490.56]  They're very good cupcakes.
[2491.50 --> 2494.98]  And I'm like, hey, does anyone want cupcakes?
[2497.00 --> 2498.18]  Everyone is like, no.
[2498.40 --> 2499.10]  They're like, no.
[2499.28 --> 2499.76]  I can't have...
[2499.76 --> 2505.00]  I, like, go around the thing and I'm like, I'm like, this, I think, Bash Bunny says no.
[2505.30 --> 2506.26]  Trash says no.
[2506.26 --> 2511.88]  The, I don't remember who was doing the edit deck at that time with all the buttons on it.
[2511.92 --> 2512.54]  They're like, no.
[2512.74 --> 2513.08]  Alan.
[2513.86 --> 2517.68]  Everybody is like, I can't for health reasons or something.
[2518.16 --> 2520.62]  And I'm like, what is going on?
[2521.16 --> 2522.82]  Why can we not eat any cupcakes?
[2523.66 --> 2524.18]  Trash them.
[2524.18 --> 2528.38]  But Tiege is actually with me on some trash would have, I bet, because he eats Twix bars
[2528.38 --> 2528.94]  in the morning.
[2529.32 --> 2530.00]  He would have had a cupcake.
[2530.00 --> 2531.34]  Defias all ate two.
[2531.62 --> 2531.98]  No, no.
[2531.98 --> 2532.88]  He's in the trap right now.
[2533.34 --> 2536.48]  So I came after you, Casey, and the cupcakes were sitting on the thing, but I think they
[2536.48 --> 2537.50]  were sitting out too long.
[2537.84 --> 2538.00]  Yeah.
[2538.00 --> 2538.62]  And I was about to eat one.
[2538.68 --> 2539.36]  They're like, don't eat it.
[2539.38 --> 2540.84]  And I was like, all right.
[2540.90 --> 2541.86]  Oh, I ate one of them next day.
[2541.86 --> 2543.22]  It would have been like the next day.
[2543.44 --> 2546.36]  It would have been out for like multiple days at that point.
[2546.80 --> 2548.30]  Oh, I ate them later in the week, too.
[2548.34 --> 2549.08]  It didn't stop me.
[2549.38 --> 2550.26]  I didn't get sick.
[2550.62 --> 2551.02]  I'm trash.
[2551.08 --> 2551.84]  You missed out, dude.
[2551.84 --> 2553.56]  Because I ate more of them the next day.
[2553.64 --> 2555.06]  I was really staring at them.
[2555.10 --> 2556.20]  I was like, I'm going to eat this.
[2556.26 --> 2557.12]  So what's going on?
[2557.12 --> 2557.96]  What's going on here, Prime?
[2557.96 --> 2561.06]  Are you on the carnivore diet?
[2561.28 --> 2562.10]  I can only have meat.
[2562.62 --> 2563.44]  So let me just hit it.
[2563.62 --> 2569.88]  So due to the throat, I was on an extremely strict diet just to reduce inflammation, which
[2569.88 --> 2573.14]  is just going to be a high meat, blueberries, and honey diet.
[2574.52 --> 2580.10]  It turns out that seems to be the best documented low inflammation diet, which is lots of protein.
[2580.70 --> 2581.62]  Blueberries and honey?
[2581.84 --> 2582.12]  Yeah.
[2582.18 --> 2589.86]  Then you spike your blood sugar like once or twice a day with like a quarter cup of honey
[2589.86 --> 2591.12]  and blueberries.
[2591.36 --> 2594.06]  It just turns out like that's like it's very inflammatory friendly.
[2594.06 --> 2594.12]  Okay.
[2594.50 --> 2597.34]  He literally started hibernating after that, though, too.
[2597.64 --> 2598.86]  He became a bear.
[2599.32 --> 2602.42]  Then I ate a bucket of hair and slept for six months.
[2602.68 --> 2603.00]  That's great.
[2603.00 --> 2607.08]  What is blueberries and honey specific?
[2607.56 --> 2611.88]  Like if it was blueberries and maple syrup, would that be the same?
[2611.94 --> 2613.72]  Or is it like honey specifically or something?
[2614.18 --> 2619.18]  I'm sure you could do a bit of a substitute with maple syrup just because it's pretty mineral dense.
[2619.74 --> 2622.96]  So some similar naturally occurring sugar or whatever.
[2622.96 --> 2623.40]  Yeah.
[2623.52 --> 2623.72]  Yes.
[2623.82 --> 2627.24]  Vegan organic and Chad is very upset at the fact that meat is low inflammation.
[2627.74 --> 2627.94]  Yes.
[2627.98 --> 2629.42]  You can look up the diets.
[2629.60 --> 2631.52]  There's quite a bit of there's quite a bit.
[2631.58 --> 2634.70]  But the beautiful part is that you can actually go about this in many different ways.
[2634.92 --> 2635.32]  Right.
[2635.32 --> 2637.36]  Like there's many diets that actually kind of fulfill this.
[2637.36 --> 2639.64]  And this was the best one for me to be successful at.
[2640.60 --> 2640.92]  Cool.
[2641.34 --> 2644.34]  So when you said cupcakes, all I wanted was cupcakes.
[2644.68 --> 2646.54]  But I just I literally said everything.
[2646.78 --> 2647.44]  Teach can be there.
[2647.54 --> 2649.38]  He can witness my level of saying no.
[2649.40 --> 2649.52]  It was true.
[2649.64 --> 2653.52]  He didn't even eat when we went to Korean barbecue.
[2654.24 --> 2655.22]  But that's just me.
[2655.34 --> 2656.76]  That's literally just me.
[2657.08 --> 2657.80]  That's just me.
[2657.80 --> 2660.52]  Because they didn't have the right meat there.
[2660.70 --> 2661.10]  Yeah.
[2661.62 --> 2662.76]  What's the right meat?
[2662.92 --> 2663.62]  What's the right meat?
[2663.86 --> 2664.22]  Chicken breast.
[2664.52 --> 2664.66]  Right.
[2664.66 --> 2671.20]  So it's like super boring because it was because the original thought like the third doctor I saw thought it was LPR.
[2671.92 --> 2675.50]  And so that means anything with fat in it can loosen your top sphincter.
[2676.02 --> 2676.40]  Oh, wow.
[2676.40 --> 2678.86]  And it lets like acid trickle up and destroy your voice.
[2679.04 --> 2679.14]  That's what they're called trash.
[2679.24 --> 2680.04]  Okay, relax.
[2680.58 --> 2681.24]  It's a generic term.
[2681.24 --> 2683.24]  Not the bottom sphincter, top sphincter trash.
[2683.50 --> 2683.66]  Yeah.
[2683.92 --> 2685.16]  I was like, what's wrong with that?
[2686.44 --> 2686.62]  Yeah.
[2686.72 --> 2688.30]  Yeah, loosen up that top sphincter.
[2688.60 --> 2690.76]  People are talking about like gaining weight and all that.
[2690.82 --> 2691.12]  I don't know.
[2691.42 --> 2693.26]  All I know is that made me real in shape.
[2693.26 --> 2694.78]  I'm feeling pretty good these days.
[2694.92 --> 2696.14]  Most in shape I've ever been.
[2696.48 --> 2697.26]  So just throwing that.
[2698.00 --> 2698.34]  Me too.
[2698.66 --> 2699.46]  If you can believe it or not.
[2699.58 --> 2699.82]  Well, yeah.
[2699.88 --> 2703.60]  I mean, eating a diet of mostly chicken breast is going to be very healthy, right?
[2703.66 --> 2703.82]  Yeah.
[2703.88 --> 2706.30]  It turns out I just think it's all lean protein.
[2706.64 --> 2707.00]  So, yeah.
[2707.08 --> 2707.22]  Yeah.
[2707.36 --> 2709.24]  I've switched over because now it's not LPR.
[2709.32 --> 2711.70]  So I've switched over to chicken thighs because they're demonstrably better.
[2712.18 --> 2713.00]  Oh, there's so much tastier.
[2713.24 --> 2714.18]  There's so much tastier.
[2714.18 --> 2717.88]  So I do like 85% chicken thighs, 15% chicken breast.
[2718.60 --> 2718.76]  All right.
[2718.82 --> 2722.06]  That's pretty much all I eat for dinner is basically big chicken thighs, broccoli, and rice.
[2722.50 --> 2724.06]  That's like effectively like my main meal.
[2724.30 --> 2724.94]  I do love broccoli.
[2724.94 --> 2725.72]  That's why I eat all this junk food.
[2725.72 --> 2727.58]  Your main meal is candy trash.
[2727.78 --> 2731.10]  It sounds like Funyuns is kind of in there though is the thing.
[2731.70 --> 2737.26]  That basically all I eat, you're like hiding 2,000 plus calories of gummy bears that you ate.
[2737.26 --> 2738.18]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2738.84 --> 2741.92]  Also, is that a piñata behind you?
[2742.38 --> 2742.92]  It is.
[2743.70 --> 2747.16]  For my birthday, my kids made me a trash piñata.
[2747.34 --> 2747.90]  That's great.
[2747.94 --> 2750.72]  It has my face, the one my son drew on it.
[2750.80 --> 2751.34]  Oh, that's great.
[2753.72 --> 2755.10]  Trash, you didn't tell us the thing.
[2755.44 --> 2755.98]  Hold on, Trash.
[2756.06 --> 2758.00]  One little thing because you say you eat a lot of broccoli.
[2758.40 --> 2761.44]  You can sprout broccoli and a pinch of sprouted broccoli.
[2761.68 --> 2763.90]  Every single one of those is equivalent to a full broccoli.
[2763.90 --> 2768.80]  So if you just don't really like broccoli, you can do a pinch of it, get like 1,000 broccolis worth of nutrition,
[2769.00 --> 2770.30]  and then you just don't have to eat broccoli.
[2771.74 --> 2772.06]  What?
[2772.30 --> 2773.40]  I mean, I'll let it out.
[2773.40 --> 2774.06]  Wait, wait.
[2774.52 --> 2775.70]  Conservation of mass.
[2775.82 --> 2777.02]  A pinch of sprouted.
[2777.08 --> 2778.80]  What does a pinch of broccoli even mean?
[2779.06 --> 2779.72]  It's insane.
[2779.72 --> 2780.30]  Conservation of mass.
[2780.34 --> 2780.96]  Don't worry about it.
[2781.18 --> 2782.14]  How do you pinch broccoli?
[2782.34 --> 2782.68]  Like, what does that mean?
[2782.68 --> 2784.06]  No, pinch of broccoli sprouts.
[2785.24 --> 2786.30]  Anyways, check it out.
[2786.48 --> 2787.08]  Makes it way easier.
[2787.24 --> 2787.74]  I hate broccoli.
[2787.76 --> 2789.12]  Let's skip this part.
[2789.52 --> 2791.60]  Trash, I want to hear what you're thankful for.
[2791.60 --> 2793.20]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[2793.38 --> 2793.76]  Yes.
[2793.90 --> 2794.84]  Well, now I'm interested.
[2795.10 --> 2796.10]  It's pinching a broccoli.
[2796.16 --> 2796.32]  Okay.
[2796.54 --> 2796.72]  All right.
[2796.76 --> 2798.32]  So next time, I understand.
[2798.48 --> 2803.40]  When I come to the tower for the next tower stream you guys do sometime in the future,
[2803.84 --> 2806.48]  I bring a bucket of chicken thighs.
[2807.28 --> 2808.12]  Yeah, there we go.
[2808.14 --> 2808.38]  Oh, my gosh.
[2808.42 --> 2809.12]  That would be so good.
[2809.38 --> 2812.68]  But hopefully next time we do something, I will be able to take you out to Korean barbecue
[2812.68 --> 2814.82]  and eat so much Korean barbecue I die.
[2815.20 --> 2816.04]  That'll work, too.
[2816.06 --> 2816.86]  That's a better plan.
[2817.26 --> 2817.66]  Sure.
[2818.02 --> 2818.64]  Or some hot pot.
[2818.66 --> 2819.44]  Or hot pot.
[2819.44 --> 2821.32]  Oh, man, I love hot pot.
[2821.56 --> 2822.32]  Oh, my gosh.
[2822.80 --> 2823.08]  Yes.
[2823.08 --> 2824.70]  Can Trash talk, though?
[2824.74 --> 2825.34]  I want to hear Trash.
[2825.36 --> 2825.56]  Yeah.
[2826.22 --> 2826.60]  All right, Trash.
[2827.30 --> 2827.90]  So what are we...
[2827.90 --> 2828.86]  What's the...
[2828.86 --> 2831.36]  Project.
[2831.64 --> 2833.36]  It was a project programming project.
[2833.50 --> 2833.72]  Oh, yeah.
[2833.72 --> 2834.00]  What are you going to go for?
[2834.22 --> 2838.30]  I have a couple, and I won't go into detail because it probably won't make any sense.
[2838.68 --> 2843.60]  So I wouldn't say it's my favorite, but I would say most rewarding, and it's an ongoing
[2843.60 --> 2844.82]  thing, is TypeScript performance.
[2845.22 --> 2846.74]  So I work in a really big repository.
[2847.62 --> 2848.62]  Crazy amount of types.
[2848.62 --> 2853.80]  A lot of developers, we don't want to hinder their developer experience, so we need the
[2853.80 --> 2854.50]  types to be faster.
[2854.72 --> 2861.34]  So I worked for like a month or two on just trying to lower the memory footprint of our
[2861.34 --> 2861.68]  types.
[2861.68 --> 2864.52]  And yeah, that was...
[2864.52 --> 2865.46]  It was pretty...
[2865.46 --> 2869.26]  It's kind of one of those things where you can't really ask anyone for help because no
[2869.26 --> 2870.26]  one really knows what to do.
[2870.66 --> 2873.96]  So you're kind of just like floundering for a while, and you kind of get discouraged, and
[2873.96 --> 2874.78]  you have your ups and downs.
[2875.36 --> 2877.82]  But then when you're on the other side of it, you're like, okay, I somewhat understand now
[2877.82 --> 2878.24]  at this point.
[2878.50 --> 2879.72]  So that's pretty much how I feel now.
[2879.72 --> 2882.78]  Another cool thing is...
[2882.78 --> 2886.56]  So since I do make tools for developers, me and Chris, we made this tool.
[2887.46 --> 2892.44]  So one big thing in the front end space is testing, and another big part of that is mocking.
[2893.08 --> 2896.86]  And what usually ends up happening in any code base, if you have a good amount of tests, you
[2896.86 --> 2897.72]  have a good amount of mocks.
[2899.02 --> 2903.98]  But the bad thing about mocks is they get stale, and you can't maintain them.
[2904.52 --> 2905.34]  Things just break.
[2905.42 --> 2907.22]  You don't really know what usually ends up happening.
[2907.22 --> 2911.22]  You just basically look at your network tab, copy and paste the response, and then move
[2911.22 --> 2911.80]  on to the life.
[2912.04 --> 2916.16]  Well, we built something called an automocker, which you basically don't have to save any
[2916.16 --> 2916.88]  mocks to the file.
[2917.38 --> 2922.30]  It will automock at request time or at runtime, and that way you don't have to maintain your
[2922.30 --> 2925.06]  mocks, and we build a whole type-safe interface around it.
[2925.68 --> 2930.82]  And we use GraphQL, so we basically introspect our graph, and you can basically just traverse
[2930.82 --> 2934.64]  down that graph in a type-safe way, and we'll automock things for you.
[2934.64 --> 2940.54]  And then the most recent thing I'm working on is, again, I work on a huge repository, and
[2940.54 --> 2942.36]  we onboard a lot of developers constantly.
[2942.98 --> 2943.64]  We want them...
[2944.64 --> 2945.42]  So you're hiring?
[2946.58 --> 2947.00]  Maybe.
[2947.64 --> 2948.04]  Probably.
[2948.20 --> 2948.42]  I don't know.
[2948.44 --> 2949.18]  Check the careers page.
[2949.38 --> 2949.60]  Maybe.
[2949.70 --> 2950.02]  Probably.
[2950.22 --> 2951.12]  I would guess so.
[2951.60 --> 2953.24]  But not my team specifically.
[2953.24 --> 2958.94]  But anyways, the whole selling point of our repository is we want developers to come into our repo
[2958.94 --> 2959.98]  because it's easy to code.
[2960.62 --> 2962.20]  So I'm building...
[2962.20 --> 2967.26]  So we use React on the front end, and the interesting part is every team basically has their own
[2967.26 --> 2970.36]  directory, so everything's co-located, right?
[2970.40 --> 2975.72]  Because you don't want 20 teams in a repository, it's hard to know where the code ownership is.
[2975.72 --> 2979.76]  So we want to keep everyone contained into their own directory, so that way if it breaks, they
[2979.76 --> 2980.40]  know where to go.
[2981.66 --> 2984.12]  But it's like, how do you tie all that stuff together?
[2984.50 --> 2987.68]  Because if everybody's a sibling, sometimes there's hierarchy in routing.
[2988.30 --> 2992.52]  So I'm building basically a wrapper around React Router in our own custom framework, so
[2992.52 --> 2995.52]  people can basically tie into our routing framework very easily.
[2996.34 --> 2998.12]  So that's something I started like two weeks ago.
[2998.24 --> 3000.56]  Hopefully I'll ship it in January after the break.
[3000.94 --> 3003.22]  But it's super cool, doing a bunch of cool stuff behind the scenes.
[3003.22 --> 3005.04]  So that's the stuff I really like to do.
[3005.06 --> 3008.58]  I don't really like doing product engineering type stuff.
[3008.66 --> 3009.48]  I like doing stuff like this.
[3009.54 --> 3010.54]  I think the stuff is way cooler.
[3011.12 --> 3013.36]  So yeah, I'm excited to see it hit prod.
[3013.42 --> 3015.64]  I already went through like 20 code reviews, got good feedback.
[3016.16 --> 3017.04]  So we're getting close.
[3017.42 --> 3019.08]  Uh-oh, TJ and I both have something to say.
[3019.46 --> 3023.38]  Yeah, I was just wondering what t-shirt size you would classify this task, and if you had
[3023.38 --> 3024.02]  any blockers.
[3024.04 --> 3028.22]  It kind of seemed like you were doing an actual stand-up, so I just wanted to get like your...
[3028.88 --> 3031.90]  You know, when we're thinking, is this Q3, Q4?
[3031.90 --> 3034.82]  Who do we need to get signed off from?
[3035.34 --> 3037.02]  We don't do t-shirt sizes, okay?
[3037.12 --> 3038.66]  We just say maybe...
[3038.66 --> 3038.82]  I love Galactus.
[3039.24 --> 3039.78]  You know what I say?
[3039.84 --> 3041.16]  I say maybe Q1.
[3041.38 --> 3042.02]  That's what I say.
[3042.10 --> 3043.56]  I say maybe Q1, 2026.
[3044.10 --> 3045.10]  I'll follow up with you then.
[3045.20 --> 3045.72]  Thanks for that.
[3045.88 --> 3047.08]  It's time to take this offline.
[3047.44 --> 3048.48]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[3050.44 --> 3052.06]  Dude, I'm actually going on call tomorrow.
[3052.16 --> 3052.82]  This is actually crazy.
[3053.90 --> 3054.26]  Anyways.
[3054.62 --> 3056.02]  You can call me anytime, Trash.
[3056.24 --> 3057.00]  Okay, thank you.
[3057.10 --> 3058.36]  It doesn't have to only be on Thanksgiving.
[3058.62 --> 3058.84]  Okay.
[3059.22 --> 3059.62]  I got you.
[3059.70 --> 3060.32]  I appreciate you.
[3060.80 --> 3061.34]  Yeah, no problem.
[3061.34 --> 3063.54]  All right.
[3064.10 --> 3064.88]  That's it?
[3066.68 --> 3067.70]  The worst.
[3068.44 --> 3069.68]  That's a great outro.
[3070.10 --> 3070.98]  All right.
[3071.68 --> 3073.86]  I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving.
[3073.86 --> 3074.80]  That is it.
[3074.94 --> 3077.12]  I have nothing left to say.
[3077.98 --> 3079.44]  There's nothing left to say.
[3079.78 --> 3082.74]  If you're not thankful by now, you're shit.
[3082.74 --> 3083.74]  The end.
[3083.74 --> 3084.74]  Exactly.
[3084.74 --> 3085.70]  The end.
[3086.64 --> 3087.84]  I'm clicking stop.
[3087.84 --> 3087.88]  The end.
[3087.88 --> 3089.52]  Boot up the day.
[3091.22 --> 3094.32]  Vibe caught in errors on my screen.
[3095.68 --> 3097.28]  Terminal coffee.
[3097.28 --> 3102.52]  We can no longer live in dreams.
[3102.56 --> 3102.72]  No matter what, we'll fly in here.
[3102.94 --> 3103.50]  And have a report.
[3103.50 --> 3104.48]  I went crazy.
[3105.02 --> 3105.48]  It went crazy.
[3105.48 --> 3107.66]  We can go every play out, and the winners Domitivo,
[3107.66 --> 3109.52]  and see if there's no more opportunity to einander,
[3109.58 --> 3110.38]  as well-looking.
[3110.38 --> 3111.22]  Let's see if there's an bummer.
[3111.42 --> 3112.04]  Oh boy ALL입니다 in here.
