• The conversation shifts to the ontology of a burrito and how math is used to understand complex systems.
• The discussion returns to the original topic of Conway's law and its influence on language design, specifically C++ and its origins in large corporate settings.

• C++ was influenced by Go, but Go itself did not exist at the time
• Go's design may have been intended for large teams, but this is unconfirmed
