[0.00 --> 3.84]  Are you gonna start my day off with a six hour Prime video?
[5.12 --> 7.00]  Oops, guess I'm done for the day.
[7.84 --> 10.98]  Day in the life, watch the Prime video, day is over.
[12.06 --> 12.86]  Quick snacks.
[13.86 --> 16.80]  Dude, I was thinking you should do a day in the life video, Trash,
[17.12 --> 20.54]  where it's just like, hey, day in the life at Netflix, arriving at 6am,
[21.02 --> 22.94]  I'm gonna grind until noon.
[23.42 --> 26.88]  You know, quickly eat lunch five minutes, grind until 4pm.
[26.88 --> 27.92]  Show food in my mouth.
[27.92 --> 30.50]  Quickly, quick snack, grind until 9pm.
[31.34 --> 34.68]  You know, like, just make it sound like Netflix is just grinding me to the ground.
[35.12 --> 38.26]  I always, I like how all of those like day in the life videos,
[38.58 --> 42.78]  I've never seen one where somebody does anything I would consider useful.
[44.30 --> 45.54]  Yeah, that's why it's so funny.
[45.74 --> 48.86]  Like, they're exclusively, I'm just like, why is anyone paying this person?
[49.02 --> 52.20]  I'm like, I would fire this person immediately upon seeing this video.
[52.38 --> 54.62]  I just be like, thank you for the video and you're fired.
[54.96 --> 57.26]  I think that's exactly what happened.
[57.92 --> 58.54]  Oh, okay.
[58.78 --> 59.08]  All right.
[59.08 --> 59.60]  I think.
[59.84 --> 61.22]  You've never been a personality hire.
[61.70 --> 63.08]  You have to do the actual work.
[63.18 --> 64.72]  Some of us are hired as personality hires.
[64.80 --> 68.24]  My job is to walk around the office and crack some jokes.
[68.50 --> 69.84]  You want to go on a coffee walk?
[70.18 --> 71.36]  Hey, what's going on over here?
[71.42 --> 72.86]  I'm not there to get work done.
[72.86 --> 74.02]  I'm there to raise the vibes.
[74.34 --> 75.50]  You're a morale hire.
[75.50 --> 76.00]  You're a morale hire.
[76.50 --> 77.50]  Sorry, scrum master.
[77.50 --> 78.12]  I'm a master.
[78.38 --> 78.48]  Yeah.
[78.56 --> 79.04]  All right.
[79.16 --> 82.18]  Guys, I hate to do this to you, but I have to be right back.
[82.94 --> 84.74]  Oh, my God, dude.
[84.82 --> 85.46]  Are you joking?
[85.78 --> 86.56]  Every time.
[86.92 --> 89.44]  It's like, hey, guys, let's get the stand-up started.
[89.56 --> 91.62]  By the way, I got to go get my tacos.
[92.46 --> 92.82]  Yeah, yeah.
[92.98 --> 93.46]  Yeah, yeah.
[93.60 --> 94.34]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[94.56 --> 95.80]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[96.32 --> 97.16]  Anyway, sorry.
[97.28 --> 97.90]  All right, Casey.
[98.46 --> 99.08]  Or Beacon.
[99.08 --> 101.78]  Who kicks us off for this one?
[102.78 --> 103.52]  You do, Prime.
[103.64 --> 104.26]  You're the host of the show.
[104.26 --> 104.72]  You do.
[104.92 --> 105.20]  You're the host.
[105.20 --> 106.46]  Welcome to the stand-up.
[106.64 --> 108.12]  We've got a great show today.
[108.32 --> 109.44]  How many times?
[109.80 --> 110.84]  This is literally.
[111.66 --> 114.54]  The only way Primal did the intro is you say, I want to do the intro.
[114.62 --> 115.70]  He goes, no, no, no, then I have to do it.
[115.78 --> 116.00]  Okay.
[116.12 --> 117.94]  If you let him do it, he's like.
[118.50 --> 119.36]  All right, all right, all right.
[119.40 --> 120.02]  All right, all right.
[120.02 --> 120.34]  Hit me.
[120.40 --> 120.96]  Hit me, Prime.
[120.96 --> 122.50]  All this misinformation and everything.
[122.64 --> 124.32]  We need to start the stand-up today.
[124.70 --> 128.76]  As always, we have TrashDev, the king of TypeScript, Casey.
[129.08 --> 131.84]  The king of amazing rants and vegan.
[132.72 --> 135.56]  Also, creatine cured my erectile dysfunction.
[135.98 --> 138.60]  All right, so now that we have that all out of the way,
[139.20 --> 143.46]  today we're going to be talking about the big oops, a 35-year mistake.
[143.96 --> 144.72]  This is a talk.
[144.90 --> 147.00]  Casey, you gave a talk at Better Software, right?
[147.06 --> 148.40]  I think it's called Better Software Conference.
[148.40 --> 149.52]  Yeah, Better Software Conference.
[149.98 --> 151.78]  And it was a two-and-a-half-hour talk.
[152.54 --> 152.84]  It was.
[152.98 --> 154.38]  Well, it was a two-hour talk.
[154.52 --> 156.62]  There was a half-hour of Q&A, so it was a two-hour talk.
[156.74 --> 156.98]  Okay.
[157.42 --> 158.52]  What was the Q&A like?
[158.52 --> 160.10]  Like, yo, so OP not that great?
[160.14 --> 161.12]  And you're like, yeah, bro.
[161.34 --> 162.14]  And that's like that.
[163.22 --> 164.90]  Well, the talk is very historic.
[165.04 --> 166.58]  It has a lot of history in it.
[166.58 --> 170.64]  It's more of sort of a showing how things played out over, you know,
[170.72 --> 175.62]  sort of the years from the 1950s up until the 1990s.
[176.26 --> 180.70]  And so most of the talk is about that historical context.
[180.94 --> 183.88]  So that was more like the Q&A was partially about that
[183.88 --> 186.82]  and partially about, you know, some specifics of what happened there.
[186.82 --> 194.38]  The talk is not really about object-oriented programming in a, like,
[195.40 --> 199.84]  it's not trying to be like you should or shouldn't do this kind of a thing.
[200.00 --> 205.06]  It's actually just really trying to be a historical talk to give you some idea of, like,
[205.52 --> 208.86]  there's this one particular thing I sort of tracked throughout history
[208.86 --> 211.28]  and showed, like, kind of how it evolved.
[211.28 --> 216.08]  And it's really more about focusing on that and understanding how it happened
[216.08 --> 218.78]  because I think there's a lot of misconceptions about how these things happened.
[218.78 --> 220.50]  And I wanted to, like, illuminate that.
[221.18 --> 224.44]  And so I never really got into the, like, you know, OOP, you know,
[224.50 --> 228.64]  I'm pretty critical of OOP as a programming model, but the talk was not about that.
[228.72 --> 232.32]  So I didn't spend, you know, 30 minutes bashing on various OOP topics.
[232.56 --> 234.26]  That's for another day, right?
[234.26 --> 237.98]  This was just about sort of the history, and I kind of wanted it be for everybody,
[238.22 --> 240.28]  including people who like object-oriented programming.
[240.52 --> 242.74]  I didn't want them to, like, not be able to watch this talk
[242.74 --> 244.84]  because it left a bad taste in their mouth or something, right?
[244.88 --> 246.22]  So that's how I put it together.
[246.46 --> 248.02]  Hey, Teej, did you pull the latest changes?
[248.90 --> 257.32]  Um, the schema diff says that you removed all the foreign key constraints from the database?
[257.92 --> 259.56]  Yeah, I refactored those away.
[259.72 --> 262.18]  You refactored the constraints away.
[262.18 --> 264.44]  Don't worry. We use TDD.
[265.08 --> 266.20]  First, no we.
[266.56 --> 269.82]  Secondly, why did you remove the foreign keys?
[270.40 --> 271.14]  Pretty obvious.
[271.64 --> 272.04]  Tariffs.
[272.34 --> 274.20]  Do you even know what tariffs are?
[274.84 --> 279.26]  It's a tax imposed by the government on goods and services imported from another country.
[279.74 --> 281.88]  They serve as a trade barrier, raising prices,
[281.96 --> 284.86]  and can potentially reduce the available quantities for business and consumer.
[285.54 --> 287.84]  This was not how I pictured using Instant Restore.
[287.96 --> 292.16]  Fine, but don't come crying to me when the IRS comes a-knockin'.
[292.18 --> 295.40]  Ship faster with Neon Postgres.
[295.92 --> 301.92]  Neon comes with branching, schema diff, and instant point-in-time recovery to help you ship fast and recover faster.
[302.28 --> 304.08]  Get the free plan at neon.com.
[304.08 --> 306.66]  I have a question.
[307.26 --> 307.68]  Yes, TDD.
[308.46 --> 315.30]  So, what's it like giving a two-hour talk, and what does that prep look like?
[315.68 --> 323.16]  Because, like, from watching the talk, amazing talk by the way, like, there was just so much context and history.
[323.16 --> 328.24]  And I don't think you're looking at presenter notes or anything.
[328.38 --> 333.08]  You're just going off the cuff, and you're just speaking fluently for, like, two hours.
[333.30 --> 333.92]  Like, what?
[334.34 --> 335.54]  How many papers did you read?
[335.64 --> 336.92]  Like, how long did it take you to do this?
[336.94 --> 340.54]  Because I was, like, so impressed with, like, no pauses.
[340.76 --> 342.02]  You're just speaking, like, fluently.
[342.12 --> 343.12]  And I was just, like, insane.
[343.24 --> 343.60]  I don't know.
[343.60 --> 347.94]  Thank you for the kind words.
[348.10 --> 353.00]  I guess what I'll say is it is shocking to me that it went as well as it did.
[353.52 --> 358.12]  So, I only, I didn't have infinite time to prepare this thing.
[358.46 --> 364.02]  Normally, if I'm going to do a talk, I have the whole thing, and I'll at least run through it once.
[364.18 --> 368.66]  So, before I'm going to get up and give the talk, right, I will rehearse the talk.
[368.66 --> 377.58]  Because I just want, like, I want to get in my head, like, where all the slides are so that I can, like, nail the transitions and stuff like that, right?
[377.64 --> 379.18]  And it's, like, it's just a thing you do.
[379.34 --> 383.72]  And I've given so many public presentations, and we do stuff like the stand-up, right?
[383.80 --> 389.20]  We have, like, all of us have a lot more practice public speaking maybe than just a dev who just goes and gives a talk.
[389.24 --> 389.92]  So, there's all that practice.
[390.84 --> 393.76]  This talk was kind of a nightmare to put together.
[393.76 --> 400.50]  Because it took so long to marshal all the information, figure out how it all goes together, and plan it.
[400.92 --> 402.80]  I literally never had a rehearsal.
[403.30 --> 406.36]  So, I had to get up and give the talk cold.
[407.10 --> 416.58]  And because I don't have, I actually don't have a slide presentation program, I made the slides in Affinity Publisher and just had them in a PNG directory.
[416.80 --> 418.40]  I also couldn't have any speaker notes.
[418.48 --> 419.34]  Like, I couldn't have anything.
[419.34 --> 427.94]  So, I was just, like, going into the talk, I'm, like, I trust that I'm old enough and have done this enough times this won't be a disaster.
[428.14 --> 433.52]  But I'm, like, I really wish I had had time to do a full rehearsal of this two-hour thing.
[433.58 --> 434.16]  But I didn't.
[434.64 --> 438.82]  So, actually, I'm as surprised as you are that it went as well as it did.
[438.82 --> 449.62]  And I think mostly where that came from was the fact that because I had spent so darn long, like, getting all the material together, that it was stuck in my head still.
[449.82 --> 452.26]  That's really how it ended up not being a disaster.
[452.58 --> 462.84]  Because, like, all that time that I did it, because I didn't have time to rehearse it, but I had spent, I don't even know, a hundred hours, maybe more, putting together all of that stuff.
[462.84 --> 467.56]  It was, like, studying for your, you know, final exam, right?
[467.68 --> 481.72]  And so, I think that's what actually happened was just, like, I had spent so long studying that it was basically, like, when you go in and you ace the final exam, even though you didn't think you were going to, just because you spent so freaking long studying the material, it ended up being something like that.
[481.78 --> 483.32]  So, I was psyched that it didn't go poorly.
[484.08 --> 488.54]  Looking at it, I think there's a bunch of places where I was, like, yeah, if I'd had a rehearsal, this would have been better.
[488.76 --> 489.44]  You can see it.
[489.52 --> 490.42]  I mean, I'm sure you could see it.
[490.42 --> 494.38]  There are places where I didn't get the, like, the timing could have been better on the transitions.
[494.70 --> 496.14]  There's a bunch of stuff like that.
[496.72 --> 498.00]  And that's just because I didn't have time.
[498.04 --> 498.84]  But the advice is great.
[498.90 --> 501.04]  So, everyone, if you have a two-hour talk, don't practice it.
[501.32 --> 501.50]  Don't practice.
[501.50 --> 502.42]  Just get out there and wing it.
[502.74 --> 503.40]  Great advice.
[503.50 --> 505.90]  Once again, I've just, everything in case you always learn something new.
[506.54 --> 507.62]  A hundred hours of study.
[508.58 --> 508.74]  Yeah.
[508.98 --> 509.70]  No practice.
[510.64 --> 513.52]  Make your notes or make your presentation as PNGs.
[513.78 --> 514.96]  Like, that's what I've heard right now.
[515.70 --> 518.14]  I kept, the PNG thing is actually insane.
[518.92 --> 519.74]  Actually, yes.
[519.74 --> 521.18]  Nothing can go wrong.
[521.36 --> 522.16]  Things can't go wrong.
[522.16 --> 523.66]  Are you just, like, airing down your, like, directory?
[524.34 --> 524.64]  Yeah.
[525.18 --> 525.86]  That's what it was.
[525.96 --> 526.68]  That's what I did.
[527.48 --> 531.64]  No, it was, it was not, like, it was not ideal.
[531.82 --> 533.88]  Like, I did not do what I would have liked to have done.
[533.88 --> 534.96]  I take back all my compliments.
[534.96 --> 535.70]  It was awful.
[535.70 --> 538.74]  I have all this stuff I got to do, like, during the week.
[538.88 --> 541.60]  Like, there's, I just, I spent as much time as I could.
[541.72 --> 545.46]  It was way more time than I should have spent preparing the talk.
[545.48 --> 549.78]  But it wasn't enough for a talk that's of this size and has this much historical information.
[549.78 --> 551.56]  So, something had to give.
[551.66 --> 553.94]  And what had, what ended up giving was the rehearsal.
[553.94 --> 563.40]  Like, and so the only thing I had was the night before, I basically, in the hotel room, I just sat at my computer and, like, talked through it.
[563.54 --> 565.22]  Like, I just mouthed through it.
[565.50 --> 566.64]  The slides really quickly.
[566.72 --> 567.36]  I was like, what am I going to say here?
[567.38 --> 567.74]  What am I going to say here?
[567.78 --> 567.96]  Right.
[568.58 --> 571.22]  And I, and then I rearranged.
[571.30 --> 575.02]  Because, like, I was like, I know if I don't go this least once, I'm going to have a slide in the wrong place.
[575.14 --> 579.46]  So, I, like, went through it and I just, like, moved some slides around and deleted some slides and stuff like that.
[579.70 --> 580.74]  And that was my deck.
[581.28 --> 584.16]  And just, I mean, thank God it worked out, I guess what I say.
[584.20 --> 588.30]  I was pretty nervous about it, to completely be honest, because I just, like, I would have liked more prep.
[588.40 --> 589.04]  I would have.
[589.06 --> 590.42]  Well, no, the length also helps.
[590.68 --> 591.42]  It's like a Twitch stream.
[591.48 --> 593.04]  You know, the first hour you're warming up.
[593.28 --> 593.46]  Yes.
[593.46 --> 595.98]  Once you get into the second hour, you're feeling good, you know?
[595.98 --> 599.06]  So, if your talk is not sounding good, just extend it by an hour.
[599.34 --> 599.68]  That's right.
[599.68 --> 604.58]  First hour, warm up, you know, get the crowd ready, get your jitters out, and then get into the real talk.
[605.10 --> 605.24]  Yeah.
[605.72 --> 612.16]  So, anyway, a short answer, the TLDR of all that is just, like, I'm as surprised as you are that it went as well as it did.
[612.78 --> 613.14]  I'm very happy.
[613.14 --> 613.62]  Probably creatine.
[613.80 --> 614.60]  I think it was the creatine.
[614.78 --> 615.68]  Yeah, I think it was the creatine.
[615.70 --> 616.00]  I should have drank more creatine.
[616.32 --> 616.70]  Had to be.
[616.70 --> 617.34]  Should have drank more creatine.
[617.34 --> 622.00]  So, I actually have a question, because one thing I thought was, I mean, I love any type of history about programming language.
[622.06 --> 623.76]  It's always interesting, so I was learning a ton.
[623.76 --> 630.62]  And also, it's kind of mind-blowing to think about, you were there before C++, so you were probably there on C++ launch night.
[630.86 --> 632.40]  Was it, like, a line at Micro Center?
[632.70 --> 635.78]  Like, what was it like when they dropped C++?
[636.04 --> 638.06]  Because the internet must have been going crazy.
[638.62 --> 641.84]  Well, I would have been, like, you know, four years old or something.
[642.10 --> 642.96]  So, like, I don't know.
[643.20 --> 647.82]  I remember holding my dad's hand in the line at Micro Center when C++ came out.
[647.82 --> 652.40]  We almost didn't get a copy, but then, you know, somebody couldn't pay, so they had one left.
[652.48 --> 653.02]  They returned.
[654.46 --> 655.56]  Yeah, I don't know.
[656.36 --> 657.34]  That has to be a skit.
[657.70 --> 658.46]  That has to be a skit.
[659.98 --> 662.00]  New programming language just dropped, bro.
[662.62 --> 663.62]  It's the sequel to C.
[663.74 --> 664.70]  Haven't you played C?
[664.70 --> 669.72]  It's a reboot.
[669.88 --> 672.58]  They're rebooting the genre, the C programming genre.
[673.28 --> 674.32]  So, yeah, I don't know.
[674.50 --> 679.94]  I remember my dad, like, started programming in C++ or, like, was looking at it a little bit.
[681.42 --> 685.48]  You know, I don't know, 1984 or 5 or something like that.
[685.48 --> 692.40]  Like, he, I don't remember when, but, like, he had, like, an early C compiler from when he was working at Digital Equipment Corporation.
[692.40 --> 700.92]  So, like, I did kind of see it vaguely around a time when it started getting more popularity, but not when it dropped, right?
[701.02 --> 703.62]  Because C++ is, like, starting in 1979.
[704.46 --> 708.68]  And I don't know when the first releases that went out widely would have been.
[709.10 --> 712.34]  It kind of gradually gets expanded past Bell Labs.
[712.54 --> 716.06]  And when you would have really started to see it at deck, I can't remember.
[716.36 --> 717.10]  Maybe my dad would.
[717.14 --> 717.62]  I should have asked him.
[717.62 --> 725.42]  So, what you're trying to say is that, you know, they always say, like, a lot of, you know, younger people, kind of the mantra of their life is, screw you, dad.
[725.74 --> 728.82]  So, since your dad was playing around in C++, you're like, screw you, dad.
[728.84 --> 729.88]  I'm only using C.
[730.40 --> 733.22]  And he kind of, like, reverted and fought against the system.
[733.92 --> 734.28]  No.
[734.56 --> 742.96]  I mean, you, as you would know, Prime, if you watched the two hours, I was a C++ programmer originally, right?
[742.96 --> 747.14]  I mean, I did learn C first, as most people in that era would have, right?
[747.28 --> 752.26]  But then I learned C++, and I used to program using, like, ridiculous C++ stuff.
[752.66 --> 756.60]  And I show, in the talk, I show slides of, like, early C++ code that I wrote.
[757.68 --> 761.70]  And it's actually part of the talk is going through that stuff.
[761.88 --> 768.42]  So, no, I've done all of the crazy C++ things that were possible in the 90s.
[768.42 --> 777.78]  There's a bunch of new, even more crazy C++ things that you can do now because they've expanded the spec considerably and continue to do so.
[778.28 --> 779.96]  But that's a different story, right?
[781.76 --> 784.16]  Wait, so what's your daily driver language right now?
[784.96 --> 787.16]  I still compile as C++.
[787.42 --> 791.32]  I don't really use any of the features besides operator overloading, really.
[792.88 --> 794.64]  That's real hipster stuff right there.
[794.78 --> 795.40]  That is, yeah.
[795.40 --> 797.68]  Compile C++, but I don't use any of it.
[797.74 --> 800.36]  I don't need any of the features, but, you know.
[800.36 --> 803.60]  Like, I'm kind of just back to, like, the original, you know?
[803.70 --> 806.54]  Like, I like early 80s C++, you know?
[806.58 --> 807.86]  Like, all their newer stuff.
[808.34 --> 813.06]  I don't like the extended funk jams, like the C++ thing where they're just going on forever.
[813.28 --> 814.50]  And it's just, I don't know, it's too sloppy.
[815.30 --> 818.22]  So, I like, yeah, that's just what I use.
[818.46 --> 821.10]  And I could switch to C, I suppose.
[821.10 --> 824.78]  But some people do, like Ryan Fleury, who gave a talk at BSC as well.
[824.86 --> 826.12]  This guy makes the rad debugger.
[826.58 --> 827.20]  He's pretty rad.
[828.10 --> 830.86]  Well, he's, I mean, he's one of the best programmers out there right now.
[831.90 --> 835.46]  And he just had the whole code base BC.
[835.66 --> 836.42]  He was like, screw it.
[836.58 --> 840.84]  It's compile times faster, and I don't really need much from C++, so we're doing C.
[841.18 --> 843.70]  And so he did it that way, and that was a good decision for him.
[844.14 --> 848.84]  I could see myself doing that, but it just, I don't have a lot of, there's not really a reason for me to do it.
[848.90 --> 850.66]  And I like operator overloading for math code.
[851.02 --> 852.02]  So that's, you know.
[852.02 --> 854.34]  Also, Casey, you just threw out, like, one of the best programmers out there.
[854.44 --> 855.44]  You got, like, a Mount Rushmore?
[855.52 --> 855.76]  Yeah.
[855.92 --> 857.40]  You got a top four live right now?
[857.46 --> 857.96]  Who are they?
[857.96 --> 859.00]  No, I absolutely do.
[859.46 --> 861.38]  Who are the Mount Rushmore programmers, Casey?
[862.04 --> 863.12]  I absolutely do.
[863.12 --> 865.84]  Like, let's put it this way.
[866.32 --> 872.26]  I, like, watch his talk at BSC because I want to know how he did some of the architecture things.
[872.26 --> 877.16]  Like, I am, like, watching because I'm, like, I'm going to learn something in this talk, right?
[877.32 --> 884.10]  I am not, like, and very rarely am I going to go to a conference and watch a talk and think that I'm going to learn something about architecture.
[884.10 --> 887.82]  Because usually it's, like, here's our ridiculous thing we did, most of which is stupid.
[888.02 --> 890.52]  That's what it feels like most of the time when I see one of those talks.
[891.00 --> 892.70]  These ones I'm, like, I want to know.
[892.78 --> 896.12]  Because, like, this dude crushes it, and I want to see what the deal is, right?
[896.16 --> 899.36]  And so he's on that list of people who, like, I want to learn from.
[899.36 --> 903.42]  And so, yeah, like, I would put him on the Mount Rushmore.
[903.88 --> 905.80]  No, you got to give us at least three more then.
[905.94 --> 906.48]  That's how it works.
[906.48 --> 907.34]  We want to know the Mount Rushmore.
[907.56 --> 909.34]  You can't say, I have a Mount Rushmore.
[910.08 --> 910.44]  Not going to tell you.
[910.44 --> 911.60]  I don't until you just said it.
[911.72 --> 918.18]  I didn't have it in my head that there was a Mount Rushmore until the first day of BSC was so good.
[918.42 --> 919.76]  Like, you know, I don't know.
[919.80 --> 921.90]  The Mount Rushmore is that conference, right?
[921.94 --> 924.12]  It's, like, I don't know.
[924.12 --> 926.14]  I don't have a Mount Rushmore.
[926.46 --> 926.98]  You're going to sit.
[927.12 --> 932.16]  I need, like, a couple hours of your time off stand-up for next week.
[932.52 --> 934.58]  You're coming back with a Mount Rushmore, okay?
[934.82 --> 935.08]  Okay.
[935.60 --> 937.46]  The people, actually, I really want to know.
[937.48 --> 938.00]  We need to know.
[938.62 --> 939.84]  But I don't think I know.
[939.94 --> 943.60]  So I'm just, like, I happen to think of him as someone who's really, really good.
[943.60 --> 948.86]  And I always want to know, like, what he's up to and, like, what sort of stuff he might have, like, done.
[949.06 --> 951.72]  Because I'm, like, it's probably something I want to know about, right?
[952.48 --> 955.60]  And so, like, it's hard for me to find stuff like that in the architecture world.
[955.68 --> 957.22]  It's easy to find stuff like that everywhere else.
[957.32 --> 963.48]  Like, you can go read, like, if you read SIGGRAPH, there's going to be, like, a ton of papers that are really cool stuff you've never thought of every year, right?
[963.80 --> 965.54]  So it's pretty easy to find stuff like that.
[965.64 --> 968.06]  But that's not, it depends what you think of as programming, right?
[968.10 --> 969.70]  That's, like, algorithms, things like that.
[969.70 --> 976.30]  So if you're actually about, like, how do you structure programs, it's really hard to think of people who, like, I think are doing really interesting work in that direction.
[976.44 --> 977.34]  But he's one of them.
[978.30 --> 978.70]  All right.
[978.70 --> 978.96]  Nice.
[979.32 --> 979.62]  All right.
[979.62 --> 981.56]  So we should probably return back to the topic, Began.
[981.74 --> 983.36]  You had, Began, didn't you have some?
[983.50 --> 984.60]  I have a topic question.
[985.00 --> 985.38]  Yeah, I know.
[985.40 --> 987.24]  I thought you had a bunch of questions associated with this.
[987.24 --> 988.30]  I have so many topic questions.
[988.30 --> 989.42]  Began, this is a stand-up.
[989.54 --> 990.96]  We need to be less distracted.
[991.84 --> 992.10]  Okay.
[992.22 --> 993.86]  Look, why'd you invite me then?
[993.92 --> 994.90]  That's not how it works.
[995.50 --> 996.70]  Began is a distraction.
[996.70 --> 997.78]  I am a distraction.
[997.78 --> 1000.32]  What did you get done yesterday, Prime?
[1000.54 --> 1001.92]  And what are you going to have done tomorrow?
[1002.14 --> 1003.02]  That's what I want to know.
[1003.40 --> 1004.20]  Great question.
[1004.36 --> 1005.94]  Read through all of the Phoenix guides.
[1006.34 --> 1008.38]  Played around with Phoenix so I can understand it.
[1008.88 --> 1009.28]  All right.
[1010.08 --> 1011.04]  What am I going to do tomorrow?
[1011.10 --> 1012.74]  I'm going to start practicing my elixir skills.
[1013.20 --> 1013.62]  I'm going to launch a little website myself.
[1013.62 --> 1015.24]  What, are you making some live dashboard or something?
[1015.24 --> 1016.66]  Oh, you got a little Erlang.
[1016.78 --> 1018.44]  You're revving up with a little Erlang action.
[1018.64 --> 1021.64]  You know, I think it could be love.
[1022.38 --> 1023.54]  Just saying, I don't know yet.
[1023.54 --> 1026.74]  I'm just, you know, I think it's usually it's lust at first sight.
[1026.86 --> 1029.62]  But then once you get past it, then it might become love.
[1029.72 --> 1030.30]  I don't know.
[1030.78 --> 1034.44]  Those lusts, honeybeads, you just love those lightweight little threads, like weaving into your heart.
[1034.74 --> 1035.36]  Oh, my gosh.
[1035.36 --> 1035.86]  It's so good.
[1036.48 --> 1036.62]  Okay.
[1036.64 --> 1037.48]  Well, I got to be honest, Prime.
[1037.52 --> 1040.22]  I think there's actually something better than Erlang or an elixir.
[1040.32 --> 1041.34]  I was going with you.
[1041.48 --> 1044.34]  But after Casey's talk, have you used Simula yet?
[1044.70 --> 1045.80]  Because it's really nice.
[1046.88 --> 1047.56]  Simula 99?
[1048.40 --> 1049.10]  It's super.
[1049.24 --> 1050.76]  I mean, I don't care what year you use.
[1050.80 --> 1051.02]  Okay.
[1051.06 --> 1052.12]  I mean, I use 67.
[1052.44 --> 1052.76]  67.
[1052.76 --> 1053.20]  We're all different.
[1053.42 --> 1053.90]  We're all different.
[1054.10 --> 1056.10]  I don't know what year you use.
[1056.32 --> 1059.32]  But yeah, I mean, I can't believe how influential it is.
[1059.88 --> 1063.10]  And actually, I was wondering, is anyone working in this still?
[1063.24 --> 1067.10]  There's got to be one person out there who's shipping some Simula.
[1067.24 --> 1068.22]  I want to meet them.
[1068.74 --> 1069.66]  That's a good question.
[1069.78 --> 1069.92]  Yeah.
[1070.02 --> 1075.74]  I mean, since the talk really only cared about Simula's influence on other languages that we now use widely,
[1075.74 --> 1081.00]  I didn't look to see, like, is anyone still riding the Simula train?
[1081.36 --> 1082.28]  That's a good question.
[1083.02 --> 1084.62]  Like, did it have a life afterwards?
[1085.24 --> 1087.30]  Like Cobalt does, where it's still around.
[1087.30 --> 1089.34]  I don't know.
[1089.68 --> 1090.30]  It's a good question.
[1090.94 --> 1091.62]  We'll find out.
[1092.26 --> 1093.78]  What do you even know about Simula Prime?
[1093.90 --> 1095.12]  Because you haven't watched the talk yet.
[1095.62 --> 1096.80]  So now we get to know what's your...
[1096.80 --> 1100.18]  I can't even think of the people's name, but I did read it in the Wii Programmers,
[1100.26 --> 1102.08]  the history of programming by Uncle Bob.
[1102.08 --> 1106.62]  So I did read about the creation of Simula, but I can't remember.
[1106.62 --> 1109.14]  First of all, I like when you're like, I don't have any facts, but I read about it in the book.
[1109.46 --> 1110.04]  Here's the book.
[1110.58 --> 1111.72]  I can't remember that.
[1111.80 --> 1112.28]  I can't remember.
[1113.92 --> 1114.28]  So.
[1115.66 --> 1120.56]  So a lot of it, like, well, I mean, to me, anytime, like, a language influences something and that it dies off,
[1120.62 --> 1122.00]  that's, like, pretty interesting, right?
[1122.02 --> 1126.20]  Because C++ obviously is heavily influenced all the way we think about object orientation.
[1127.12 --> 1129.94]  And it's still used widely by a bunch of people.
[1129.98 --> 1130.58]  So that makes sense.
[1130.58 --> 1132.98]  You learn something in C++ land, you apply it to another language.
[1133.36 --> 1136.96]  Like, what are other languages along the path in your career, Casey, that, like, died,
[1137.06 --> 1139.06]  that you were like, this was hot, this is going to be good.
[1139.08 --> 1142.40]  And then it died off, but it ended up being something, like, influential.
[1143.48 --> 1145.06]  You know, I'm not sure.
[1145.06 --> 1151.42]  I think, like, for me, the only language I can think of that clearly was very influential,
[1151.86 --> 1154.32]  but doesn't really get used anymore.
[1154.56 --> 1159.90]  I mean, it gets used, but it's not used in sort of the same sense as a Python or a C++
[1159.90 --> 1164.18]  or anything like that, JavaScript, would have been Pascal.
[1164.90 --> 1170.76]  A lot of us, including me, programmed for some time in Pascal in that era.
[1170.76 --> 1175.64]  And it was, you know, nowadays, it's just not a thing anyone would really think to use.
[1175.72 --> 1177.50]  I'm sure you can still go use it just fine.
[1177.50 --> 1180.28]  But there was a whole lineage of Pascal.
[1180.72 --> 1182.60]  Nicholas Wirth was the guy who created that.
[1182.70 --> 1187.72]  And then there was, like, a very famous version called Turbo Pascal, which was for DOS, right?
[1187.78 --> 1193.46]  And this was a really great dev environment, actually, at the time before, like, IDEs were really any good.
[1193.58 --> 1196.20]  It was, like, the first really good IDE.
[1196.20 --> 1202.84]  I mean, that might be a strong statement, but at least for PCs, it was the first good IDE, let's say.
[1203.94 --> 1210.80]  And so I think that's an example of a language that a lot of people used and probably a lot of people learned to program on.
[1210.98 --> 1213.76]  Like, that was my first structured programming language, really.
[1213.76 --> 1222.34]  Like, because basic, you know, a lot of us learned to program on basic, on some, you know, some built-in basic that we had on a computer, a home computer.
[1222.66 --> 1231.40]  And then the first time I actually got something that, like, had, you know, proper structured programming the way we would think of it with, like, local variables and things like that, it was Pascal.
[1231.74 --> 1234.04]  And I think at that time, a lot of people, that would not be true.
[1234.08 --> 1237.44]  It would be hard to find somebody whose first structured programming language today was Pascal.
[1237.86 --> 1238.84]  So funny you should say that.
[1238.84 --> 1245.40]  Someone came into chat today and said, hey, Chad, am I cooked because I'm at university and the language that they're teaching us as our first language is Pascal.
[1246.50 --> 1247.14]  No way!
[1247.30 --> 1247.50]  Okay.
[1247.64 --> 1249.02]  So someone's still doing it.
[1249.28 --> 1249.98]  Someone's still doing it.
[1249.98 --> 1254.36]  And then they said that it's really great for structured programming, for teaching structured programming.
[1254.70 --> 1255.02]  I don't know.
[1255.08 --> 1256.34]  I only did a touch of Pascal.
[1257.26 --> 1258.84]  I don't think there's anything wrong with learning.
[1259.00 --> 1263.64]  Like, the translation, moving from Pascal to C is pretty trivial.
[1264.04 --> 1266.98]  Like, you really aren't going to get thrown for a loop there.
[1266.98 --> 1268.24]  So I don't think it matters.
[1268.66 --> 1272.80]  Like, if you learned Pascal and then you want to go do some systems programming or whatever, you just can.
[1273.10 --> 1273.94]  Like, it's not going to be.
[1274.06 --> 1280.56]  They did say the following, the follow-up phrase, in case you maybe have an opinion about this, but they did say that Pascal is like C just without the foot guns.
[1281.84 --> 1282.06]  Yeah.
[1282.16 --> 1284.66]  I mean, it's one of the problems with Pascal.
[1284.90 --> 1290.08]  In fact, this is, I don't know, I think this made it into the lecture.
[1290.20 --> 1295.46]  I can't always remember what stuff ends up making it into big oops and what doesn't, but pretty sure this made it in.
[1295.46 --> 1305.08]  And Strustrip actually said specifically that he thought Pascal's type system was, like, too restrictive and it causes problems, whereas simulas he actually liked.
[1305.56 --> 1316.28]  And so one of the big things for making C++ was to try to bring more type safety to C, but that didn't cause you a lot of problems like he thought Pascal did.
[1316.64 --> 1318.32]  So that was his opinion of it anyway.
[1318.32 --> 1323.60]  There's also multiple people in chat who are saying they're using Delphi or Delphi, however you pronounce it.
[1323.60 --> 1324.32]  Borland Delphi.
[1324.92 --> 1326.62]  So it's like Pascal, Pascal's used.
[1326.76 --> 1327.88]  That's pretty, that's good.
[1327.94 --> 1328.86]  People making money from it.
[1329.26 --> 1336.70]  Jeff Roberts still used to write stuff in Delphi when I was back at Rad in, you know, early 2000s.
[1336.84 --> 1338.82]  He made, like, an MP3 player in Delphi.
[1339.40 --> 1341.60]  So he still liked it.
[1341.60 --> 1345.06]  A lot of people really liked those old Borland products because they were very well made.
[1345.62 --> 1350.96]  And you don't, even though they tend to fall away, like, very few people actually use Delphi now.
[1352.60 --> 1357.84]  It's not like it's because someone made the way better version of that thing.
[1358.14 --> 1361.66]  It just kind of ended up dying out because Borland as a company kind of died out.
[1361.74 --> 1364.26]  It's like the architectures were still, like, really good sometimes.
[1364.26 --> 1367.36]  And, like, people have trouble finding modern replacements that were as good.
[1367.62 --> 1368.66]  Sort of like Visual Basic.
[1368.66 --> 1370.84]  Like, a lot of people really liked using Visual Basic.
[1371.14 --> 1376.50]  And, like, we never really got something that was as easy for newbies to use as that a lot of times.
[1376.58 --> 1380.64]  You know, like, there's just a lot of, like, we had a really good thing and it kind of died out.
[1380.72 --> 1384.00]  But the new stuff really isn't a replacement or isn't quite as good.
[1384.22 --> 1386.64]  And so that's kind of just a sad thing that happens.
[1386.90 --> 1388.18]  And Delphi is kind of one of those things.
[1388.70 --> 1390.78]  I mean, Trash, you're a fan of Borland products, correct?
[1392.94 --> 1394.24]  Well, it's got the Borland name.
[1394.30 --> 1395.12]  Well, you know Quattro, right?
[1396.20 --> 1396.74]  Wait, what?
[1396.86 --> 1397.04]  Quattro Pro?
[1397.14 --> 1398.14]  Quattro Pro, the database.
[1398.14 --> 1398.52]  Oh, yeah.
[1398.92 --> 1400.26]  You use Sidekick, right, though?
[1400.86 --> 1401.22]  Sidekick?
[1401.36 --> 1401.98]  No, no.
[1402.26 --> 1402.54]  Interbase?
[1402.66 --> 1403.16]  No, no.
[1403.16 --> 1404.46]  You don't use any Borland products at all.
[1404.66 --> 1404.84]  No.
[1405.22 --> 1406.82]  If it's got the Borland name, it's good.
[1406.94 --> 1408.76]  You've got to get, like, what are you, JetBrains?
[1408.84 --> 1410.98]  Yeah, what about just the Borland C++ compiler?
[1411.08 --> 1412.00]  I did use JetBrains, yeah.
[1412.00 --> 1412.42]  Did you ever at least do that one?
[1413.48 --> 1414.56]  The compiler's great.
[1414.80 --> 1415.64]  Yeah, the compiler's great.
[1415.90 --> 1417.52]  Okay, I didn't know Borland.
[1417.62 --> 1420.32]  I just got the Wikipedia pulled up and I really wanted to talk down a trash.
[1420.32 --> 1420.92]  I was like, were you?
[1421.00 --> 1422.76]  I was like, where are you getting these names?
[1423.18 --> 1424.24]  You're not using Quattro Pro?
[1424.28 --> 1425.34]  I was like, what is happening?
[1425.34 --> 1426.84]  What about Owl?
[1426.98 --> 1430.52]  Do you use the Owl, Borland's Owl class library for windowing?
[1433.00 --> 1433.40]  Yes.
[1434.00 --> 1434.88]  Yes, the answer is yes.
[1434.88 --> 1441.12]  Okay, so in the talk, another thing, someone requested it too, and I need my memory refreshed
[1441.12 --> 1441.58]  on it.
[1442.18 --> 1443.02]  What is Plex?
[1443.32 --> 1445.36]  I don't understand this.
[1445.70 --> 1446.10]  Really?
[1446.74 --> 1447.78]  Yeah, well, I'm dumb.
[1447.96 --> 1448.52]  You have to remember.
[1448.68 --> 1453.14]  Very stupid, and I might have been a little distracted during this portion.
[1453.36 --> 1457.14]  I had a sixth latest buyer run going, and I looked up and I went, what is Plex?
[1457.14 --> 1457.26]  Yes.
[1457.84 --> 1458.24]  Okay.
[1459.36 --> 1464.10]  So I apologize if I didn't do a good enough job.
[1464.10 --> 1464.90]  No, you did a good job.
[1465.04 --> 1468.26]  I have the worst ADHD the doctor's ever seen, they said.
[1468.28 --> 1468.46]  Okay, that's fair.
[1468.46 --> 1478.08]  So you have to remember, and this is one of the things that I tried to really give some
[1478.08 --> 1482.52]  context for in the talk, but it's hard to wrap your head around, is I guess the way I
[1482.52 --> 1494.08]  would say it, nowadays we just assume, like everybody just assumes that we have this concept that
[1494.08 --> 1502.84]  we can take a set of data, like, you know, int x, int y, char star foo, or something, right?
[1503.50 --> 1508.66]  And put them together in a struct, or a class, or whatever you want to think of.
[1508.66 --> 1516.24]  And then that will be like, in memory, it will just be stored that way, and it's very
[1516.24 --> 1518.14]  fast for us to access, right?
[1519.48 --> 1523.84]  So one way to draw a differentiation here would be to think about, you know how JavaScript
[1523.84 --> 1527.10]  is kind of like, well, it's just this big hash table.
[1527.26 --> 1530.96]  It's like, if I want to make an object, it's just a big bag, and I put things in it, and
[1530.96 --> 1535.36]  then if I want to get them out, it's going to be like a lookup on like this name, whatever
[1535.36 --> 1536.16]  it is, right?
[1536.16 --> 1536.40]  Right.
[1537.82 --> 1542.60]  And then like, maybe the jit, if it can figure it out, can make it into something that's
[1542.60 --> 1545.26]  like a fixed thing in memory, but not necessarily, right?
[1545.86 --> 1551.18]  Whereas in C, or in Rust, or probably in Go, I'm assuming as well, like there's, you know,
[1551.38 --> 1556.80]  languages that are kind of made more for compile time, I can say this is the data layout, and
[1556.80 --> 1560.70]  then I can just have like a pointer, or a handle, or a reference, or whatever it gets called
[1560.70 --> 1565.56]  in that language, is like the location in memory where this thing is, and if I want the int x,
[1565.56 --> 1568.98]  I can just get it, if I want the int y, I can just get it, just with a simple numerical
[1568.98 --> 1569.42]  offset.
[1569.56 --> 1573.06]  So it's super efficient to talk about this like bundle of data.
[1573.32 --> 1577.44]  So what you have to remember, and it's really hard to wrap your head around, like I said,
[1577.64 --> 1581.86]  is if you rewind time to 1950, no one had thought of that.
[1582.96 --> 1585.14]  That's just not on the table, right?
[1585.42 --> 1590.82]  No one had thought that what you want when you're writing like in a higher level language,
[1590.82 --> 1594.06]  which they hadn't really even conceived of at that time very much, right?
[1594.74 --> 1600.12]  When you're programming a computer, they're like, oh wait, we could just store like one
[1600.12 --> 1606.74]  address in the computer's memory, and we could know how to get to lots of different related
[1606.74 --> 1613.56]  pieces of data all bundled together just by using a fixed numerical offset that we know
[1613.56 --> 1616.76]  is the same no matter which one of these we're using, right?
[1616.76 --> 1624.14]  So you could kind of think of this as like the most, the earliest form of the idea of
[1624.14 --> 1624.76]  instantiation.
[1625.58 --> 1632.78]  Like I have a definition of a thing, a type, and I'm going to actually have now one of those,
[1632.86 --> 1636.34]  and I could make another one if I wanted at a different place in memory, right?
[1637.22 --> 1641.76]  And so just to underscore, because again, it's really hard to wrap your head around this,
[1641.80 --> 1643.48]  because we just, it's just assumed now.
[1643.48 --> 1645.36]  Like we don't even think about this at all anymore.
[1645.36 --> 1648.10]  It's just like, of course you could do that if you wanted to or whatever, right?
[1648.76 --> 1651.84]  Just to underscore how much they didn't know this yet.
[1653.62 --> 1658.16]  When, so Doug T. Ross is this guy who comes up with the concept of a Plex.
[1658.58 --> 1666.80]  He's on this team at MIT at this laboratory for, it's called the Servo Mechanisms Laboratory
[1666.80 --> 1667.48]  at the time.
[1667.62 --> 1672.74]  It later gets renamed to a different name whose name escapes me, but it's, it's originally
[1672.74 --> 1674.04]  called the Servo Mechanisms Laboratory.
[1675.70 --> 1680.36]  And what they do is they make like robotic tooling for making, like, you know, we would
[1680.36 --> 1684.12]  think of it today as 3D printing almost is what they're working on way back in the 50s.
[1686.04 --> 1687.82]  Making this stuff for the Air Force and whatever.
[1687.82 --> 1690.86]  So, it's like ZOD stuff, right?
[1691.38 --> 1700.06]  So anyway, the idea here is back then, you had, like, in memory, you had arrays and stuff.
[1700.74 --> 1704.02]  So, you know, they would think of it as like, oh, I have an array of integers.
[1704.30 --> 1705.54]  They had that concept.
[1705.86 --> 1710.96]  So I'm going to think of it as like, I've got a base pointer to an array, and I'm going
[1710.96 --> 1714.40]  to get the third element out of that array to get one of the integers.
[1714.40 --> 1716.44]  That's the thing everyone's thinking about.
[1716.90 --> 1719.62]  Doug Ross publishes a paper, right?
[1719.70 --> 1721.16]  Lee publishes a paper.
[1721.28 --> 1724.12]  This is how much people weren't thinking about this.
[1724.68 --> 1726.62]  Saying, hey, I got this idea.
[1727.16 --> 1733.36]  What if we flipped the arguments to the hardware array indexer?
[1733.64 --> 1739.84]  So that instead of thinking of jumping a fixed size N, like, you know, we're going to go
[1739.84 --> 1742.26]  through elements of an array off of a base pointer.
[1742.26 --> 1747.78]  What if we flipped it and said, instead, what we have is a base pointer and then a flexible
[1747.78 --> 1748.24]  offset.
[1748.54 --> 1755.66]  So the array is of these larger chunks, and then we just sub go arbitrary offset inside
[1755.66 --> 1757.06]  the sub chunks or flip it.
[1757.40 --> 1760.88]  It said it will flip the fixed offset and the flexible offset part of that.
[1761.10 --> 1762.82]  He called it reverse indexing.
[1763.28 --> 1768.30]  And then he's like, if we do that, then we can have this thing called a plex, which is
[1768.30 --> 1771.22]  a bunch of related data that's all smushed together.
[1771.22 --> 1773.10]  And we can have lots of those.
[1773.42 --> 1776.76]  And that we could just go, oh, let's look at the X coordinate of this thing and the Y
[1776.76 --> 1778.18]  coordinate of this thing and the name of this thing.
[1778.22 --> 1779.18]  And they'll all be together.
[1779.38 --> 1779.58]  Right.
[1779.58 --> 1786.66]  And that's what he called the plex for it's short for plexus, which I guess I don't speak
[1786.66 --> 1791.86]  Latin, but I guess, you know, if you're a doctor or a lawyer and you do that, I guess
[1791.86 --> 1797.92]  means like an interconnected, like a node where things are connected, like that kind of, I
[1797.92 --> 1801.48]  don't know, it's like solar plexus might be a use of that term.
[1801.48 --> 1801.72]  Right.
[1801.74 --> 1804.80]  Like a thing where a bunch of things comes together, a node where things can come together.
[1804.80 --> 1810.18]  And he calls it that because not only did he conceptualize this idea of packing all
[1810.18 --> 1815.88]  the things together as the way a program might be operating, but he also figured out
[1815.88 --> 1821.44]  that you could add, you could augment that thing with stuff like relational links to other
[1821.44 --> 1821.74]  things.
[1821.74 --> 1827.46]  So the idea of a pointer from one plex to another to say like, this is the point that I am,
[1827.46 --> 1832.02]  you know, I'm a line and I have two end points and here's pointers to each of those
[1832.02 --> 1832.38]  points.
[1832.56 --> 1832.68]  Right.
[1832.84 --> 1834.56]  And those are plexes themselves.
[1834.56 --> 1840.04]  And so, so he was imagining this big web of these things, which is exactly how we compute
[1840.04 --> 1840.40]  today.
[1840.60 --> 1842.60]  Like it is literally how we program today.
[1842.78 --> 1844.64]  And he figured this out in 1956.
[1845.60 --> 1845.88]  Okay.
[1845.98 --> 1846.94]  So wait, I think I understand this.
[1846.98 --> 1847.14]  Okay.
[1847.18 --> 1851.10]  So like for the other people in the chat who are a little slower, like myself, it's like
[1851.10 --> 1854.36]  back in the day, if I want to go to a friend's house, I wrote their address down.
[1854.44 --> 1856.22]  So I got an address, get to a friend's house.
[1856.34 --> 1857.32]  I got another friend.
[1857.38 --> 1858.50]  I write their address down again.
[1858.56 --> 1859.32]  I go to their house.
[1859.76 --> 1861.34]  However, I want to get to the McDonald's.
[1861.38 --> 1864.10]  I don't want to write down how to get to the McDonald's from the friend's house.
[1864.10 --> 1865.56]  I know it's two blocks up.
[1865.64 --> 1867.30]  I know there's an Arby's two blocks that way.
[1867.44 --> 1869.46]  And there's a Wendy's two blocks that way.
[1869.46 --> 1873.52]  So I just store the one address and I know get to a friend's house.
[1873.64 --> 1874.92]  And then I've got Arby's here.
[1875.00 --> 1876.36]  I've got my McDonald's over there.
[1876.42 --> 1879.24]  I got my blank Wendy's over there and I'm storing less data.
[1879.36 --> 1883.00]  Two blocks up is a lot better than like a full, a full address to get somewhere.
[1883.38 --> 1885.82]  Well, this makes perfect sense, right?
[1885.82 --> 1889.84]  Well, this is a bit of a tortured metaphor, but I'll try to run with it.
[1890.28 --> 1894.80]  It's you don't even have to store anything because the point is that it's as if all of
[1894.80 --> 1897.64]  your friend's houses all had an Arby's two blocks up.
[1898.02 --> 1901.80]  So you just know when you go to any friend's house, you go up two blocks.
[1901.88 --> 1904.06]  You don't have to store that information because it's a given.
[1904.28 --> 1907.36]  And that's the magic of a plex or a struct as we now call it.
[1907.70 --> 1910.04]  Typically in like C parlance, we would call it a struct.
[1910.04 --> 1916.14]  But it's basically saying, look, if I just know the block layout and that's compiled directly
[1916.14 --> 1921.30]  into the program, then I no longer have to do all this work to gather the data.
[1921.42 --> 1922.68]  It's all right there.
[1922.80 --> 1925.86]  And furthermore, I can easily reference one or the other.
[1925.96 --> 1929.10]  Like I can just, like you said, I can just say the address of a friend's house.
[1929.10 --> 1931.80]  And now you also know the address of the Arby's, right?
[1932.32 --> 1937.36]  And again, in this weird world we're living in, all friends' houses have Arby's two blocks
[1937.36 --> 1939.42]  up for them, which I don't know if that's good.
[1939.42 --> 1942.92]  Like I don't know if all your friends, I don't know if there's that many Arby's that
[1942.92 --> 1944.66]  should be in the world, but let's say that there is.
[1944.74 --> 1946.14]  Everyone likes roast beef a lot.
[1946.48 --> 1947.78]  And so that's what's happening.
[1947.88 --> 1948.48]  Then yeah.
[1949.46 --> 1951.92]  For those that don't know, I believe this was during the 40s.
[1952.56 --> 1956.38]  Computers didn't even have the concept of an indirect address for quite some times or
[1956.38 --> 1961.48]  an indirect reads, being able to use a memory spot as a means to read into something else.
[1962.18 --> 1966.22]  And so this was already like we're not even that far from a world where they're just like,
[1966.22 --> 1970.36]  wait a second, we could read from one location into another location.
[1970.46 --> 1972.88]  We could just store something that could read somewhere else all the time.
[1972.96 --> 1975.64]  So like this is only on the heels of that.
[1976.36 --> 1976.82]  So it's actually...
[1976.82 --> 1981.72]  Well, like I said, he actually was sort of saying, look, what you could do is use this
[1981.72 --> 1986.32]  instruction that these machines have for array indexing and flip the parameters and it will
[1986.32 --> 1987.16]  do this kind of...
[1987.16 --> 1992.12]  So he's literally having to like back fit this idea onto the hardware because the hardware
[1992.12 --> 1994.90]  wasn't really designed to do this.
[1995.30 --> 1995.40]  Right.
[1995.54 --> 1995.66]  Yeah.
[1995.72 --> 2001.02]  So that's how not like thinking in this direction it was at the time.
[2001.24 --> 2001.42]  Yeah.
[2001.66 --> 2002.54]  Well, it's also just...
[2002.54 --> 2003.50]  It was so new still.
[2003.78 --> 2003.88]  Right.
[2003.94 --> 2004.90]  Like this whole...
[2004.90 --> 2007.98]  It's just like people even have this concept of like...
[2007.98 --> 2013.00]  I think it's so easy to take for granted how much we have kind of pre-built into our head
[2013.00 --> 2013.50]  on this.
[2014.16 --> 2014.38]  Yeah.
[2014.38 --> 2016.98]  And so what people were, you know, so other competing...
[2016.98 --> 2018.30]  There were other ideas at the time too.
[2018.60 --> 2021.10]  So Lisp is contemporaneous with this.
[2021.20 --> 2025.96]  They're actually both kind of doing this work in like the mid-1950s, 1956, 7, 8.
[2027.50 --> 2029.54]  Lisp was taking like a different approach.
[2029.82 --> 2034.28]  They still want to do stuff like bags of data where we kind of know like, oh, the first one
[2034.28 --> 2036.20]  is this, the second one is this, the third one is this.
[2036.54 --> 2041.24]  But in Lisp, since everything is treated as like these sort of like uniform elements that
[2041.24 --> 2045.52]  kind of get concatenated together, you had to do stuff like, okay, I know I need to
[2045.52 --> 2053.20]  hop three elements down in my list, right, to get to this particular element of it, right,
[2053.32 --> 2056.24]  which is way less efficient with the way that Lisp is constructed.
[2056.66 --> 2060.84]  And so actually one of the things that Doug Ross does in his first paper he published
[2060.84 --> 2065.64]  because he has the idea in 1956, he publishes a paper on it in 1960, which by the way is the
[2065.64 --> 2068.00]  same year that like Lisp published their paper.
[2068.00 --> 2072.08]  So it's like right there, these are both at the same time, McCarthy publishes the primary
[2072.08 --> 2073.86]  paper on Lisp in 1960 as well.
[2075.22 --> 2080.64]  And he actually kind of, he disses Lisp a little bit, right, in the paper.
[2080.76 --> 2084.16]  He's like, yeah, you know, these guys work on this because remember McCarthy's at MIT,
[2085.42 --> 2088.86]  Ross is at MIT, everyone's at MIT, they all know what's up, right?
[2090.00 --> 2095.26]  He basically says like, yeah, Lisp, it's inefficient because I want to get that third element.
[2095.26 --> 2097.64]  I got to go through each thing.
[2097.78 --> 2102.24]  And also when you're storing it, it's inefficient because you have to store the linkages between
[2102.24 --> 2105.64]  these things to treat them as these uniform manipulable lists.
[2105.72 --> 2109.96]  It's like, I don't need to do that when I know my layout, when I'm, once I've decided
[2109.96 --> 2111.86]  on the layout for this thing, I can just fix it in place.
[2111.94 --> 2113.74]  And this turns out to be incredibly powerful concept.
[2113.82 --> 2114.28]  So powerful.
[2114.44 --> 2116.94]  It's the building block of like every program I wrote right today.
[2117.00 --> 2118.50]  And a lot of people that's true too.
[2118.98 --> 2120.60]  Obviously some languages, not so much.
[2120.66 --> 2124.42]  Like I said, JavaScript is more of a language that's more Lisp like.
[2124.42 --> 2128.30]  It's saying like, well, an object is kind of just a handle and then there's this big
[2128.30 --> 2130.28]  hash table and I can just throw anything in that I want.
[2130.40 --> 2133.90]  That has a like nice flexibility to it, but it has costs, right?
[2133.92 --> 2135.14]  It has efficiency costs to it.
[2135.46 --> 2140.04]  And so what Doug Ross is really doing with this Plex is coming up with this idea of the
[2140.04 --> 2142.66]  more efficient version for when you don't need that flexibility.
[2143.40 --> 2143.76]  Okay.
[2143.90 --> 2149.28]  We have actually a pretty interesting question from the chat, which is, did they have creatine
[2149.28 --> 2149.82]  back then?
[2149.82 --> 2152.06]  They did.
[2152.26 --> 2157.30]  I'm sure because I feel like Doug Ross must have been drinking it because I don't know
[2157.30 --> 2158.50]  how he came up with so much stuff.
[2158.78 --> 2163.04]  We're not even done yet with Plex is including in the first paper.
[2163.16 --> 2164.12]  I need more creatine.
[2164.26 --> 2169.42]  The very first paper on Plex is, he also nailed discriminated unions.
[2169.42 --> 2174.42]  So the idea that you could have a type field in there that would basically change how this
[2174.42 --> 2179.50]  thing was processed or what some of the data was used for and virtual functions.
[2179.62 --> 2183.24]  Basically the idea of a function pointer was in the original Plex paper.
[2183.34 --> 2188.68]  He's like, look inside this Plex, we could also just put a jump like an address in the
[2188.68 --> 2193.70]  Plex so that when the thing comes to process it, it can read that address and jump to a subroutine
[2193.70 --> 2199.24]  that will process this Plex efficiently, specifically, and do things specific only to this Plex.
[2199.46 --> 2199.62]  Right?
[2199.78 --> 2201.90]  So he crushes it all.
[2202.18 --> 2204.14]  He's just like, welcome to the future.
[2204.96 --> 2210.04]  Here's my 1960s paper that tells you all of the tools that everyone will use in the year
[2210.04 --> 2216.48]  2025, pretty much down to a, like down to the layout in memory.
[2217.42 --> 2221.62]  And then like, for some reason he doesn't just mic drop and walk off stage.
[2221.72 --> 2224.28]  I would have, I would have been like, all right, y'all I'm done.
[2224.78 --> 2226.12]  You're welcome for the future.
[2226.78 --> 2227.56]  I'm Doug T.
[2227.64 --> 2227.88]  Ross.
[2227.94 --> 2228.48]  Thank you.
[2228.98 --> 2230.38]  Good night, Cleveland or whatever.
[2230.48 --> 2230.70]  Right?
[2230.74 --> 2231.40]  Like that kind of thing.
[2231.40 --> 2237.40]  This guy literally foresaw all of modern computing, like whether intentional or by accident,
[2237.40 --> 2241.84]  he foresaw everything and that's because you pretty much described everything we use today.
[2242.30 --> 2242.70]  Correct.
[2242.88 --> 2246.92]  Like he got all the building blocks and the thing that really, oh, and by the way, he
[2246.92 --> 2248.12]  also nailed the free store.
[2248.38 --> 2252.84]  He had this thing called beads where it was like, oh, if we take these Plexes and we sort
[2252.84 --> 2258.78]  them by like their size, we can have free lists that just are batches of these so that
[2258.78 --> 2259.92]  we won't fragment memory.
[2260.18 --> 2262.44]  And then he comes up with the arena.
[2262.86 --> 2266.62]  He's like, we can also just batch free the entire group of the Plexes.
[2266.74 --> 2267.14]  Right?
[2268.18 --> 2269.22]  That's crazy.
[2269.52 --> 2271.10]  No, the dude is like next level.
[2271.20 --> 2274.40]  And here's the thing that sucks because people don't fricking read.
[2274.50 --> 2279.80]  They write histories of these things and completely miss this because they don't bother to read.
[2279.90 --> 2283.74]  They just go to Wikipedia and then they type that out in their book and you get a completely
[2283.74 --> 2285.78]  bogus history that leaves these people out.
[2285.78 --> 2290.44]  But he's the guy who actually figured this crap out and it's awesome.
[2291.06 --> 2292.00]  So like I'm on team.
[2292.08 --> 2294.10]  I want to like get Doug T.
[2294.18 --> 2297.04]  Ross back into the Wikipedia pages, people, because this dude.
[2297.04 --> 2298.64]  He actually figured it out.
[2298.78 --> 2301.34]  He kind of went a little crazy later.
[2301.64 --> 2302.96]  A lot of them go crazy.
[2303.32 --> 2306.68]  As it tends to happen when you invent a lot of brand new things.
[2307.80 --> 2308.92]  But, you know.
[2309.34 --> 2310.52]  But rock stars die young.
[2311.16 --> 2311.32]  Great.
[2311.32 --> 2311.60]  That's right.
[2311.60 --> 2313.06]  That's right, baby.
[2313.20 --> 2315.44]  I mean, I don't know what happened later in life.
[2315.76 --> 2316.98]  I don't know what direction he took.
[2317.10 --> 2319.60]  But in the 60s, he invented the discriminated union.
[2319.80 --> 2320.64]  I don't support that.
[2320.86 --> 2322.92]  That sounds like something he invented in the 60s.
[2322.92 --> 2324.78]  Not for me.
[2325.52 --> 2326.06]  I'm sorry.
[2326.14 --> 2326.62]  I couldn't help myself.
[2327.08 --> 2327.84]  Also, I love.
[2328.10 --> 2328.72]  You can't.
[2328.78 --> 2330.04]  You have to say the T every time.
[2330.16 --> 2330.40]  Okay.
[2330.78 --> 2330.94]  Yeah.
[2331.06 --> 2331.38]  Doug T.
[2331.52 --> 2331.66]  Ross.
[2332.08 --> 2332.50]  Doug T.
[2332.50 --> 2332.82]  Ross.
[2333.06 --> 2333.24]  Ross.
[2333.32 --> 2336.26]  If you have a middle letter like that, that means like more powerful.
[2336.26 --> 2337.04]  It's like Samuel L.
[2337.16 --> 2337.52]  Jackson.
[2337.66 --> 2338.04]  Exactly.
[2338.04 --> 2339.16]  It's not just Samuel L.
[2339.16 --> 2339.34]  Samuel L.
[2339.34 --> 2339.70]  Jackson.
[2339.90 --> 2341.48]  Like the middle letter is important.
[2341.90 --> 2347.02]  So if all these things have come true, I now need to find out what has not come true.
[2347.18 --> 2350.04]  And I got to give him Pauly Market and make a bet that it's going to come true.
[2350.16 --> 2351.58]  Like what was he wrong about then?
[2352.48 --> 2354.52]  He did not have a 100% success rate.
[2354.52 --> 2358.92]  If he's the Nostradamus of tech, that means he's probably 99% wrong.
[2359.02 --> 2359.22]  He's from the future.
[2359.40 --> 2361.52]  He's from the future if he got everything right.
[2361.94 --> 2363.12]  That's a good question.
[2363.80 --> 2365.36]  I mean, maybe if you looked at some.
[2365.36 --> 2377.30]  Like afterwards, he started to think that Plexus, and I kind of understand why, but like he started to think of Plexus as like the nature of the universe.
[2378.74 --> 2380.02]  Do you know what I'm going with this?
[2380.16 --> 2382.68]  Like he was like, oh, the entire world is Plexus.
[2383.14 --> 2385.04]  It's like all he sees is just Plexus.
[2385.22 --> 2385.92]  Everything's a Plex.
[2386.04 --> 2386.20]  Yeah.
[2386.38 --> 2389.32]  So like it kind of like, it kind of went that way.
[2389.42 --> 2391.64]  So I, and I don't know that it is.
[2391.72 --> 2393.64]  I mean, I don't, I'm just not for me to say.
[2393.64 --> 2396.96]  I don't have Doug T. Ross levels of, of future.
[2397.28 --> 2398.58]  I'm not smart enough to see it, see the world.
[2398.62 --> 2400.24]  He's kind of on a different level.
[2400.34 --> 2405.80]  So I don't want to say that they're not, but it certainly hasn't quite turned out that way yet.
[2406.00 --> 2407.88]  So he also invented simulation theory.
[2408.94 --> 2409.56]  Kind of.
[2410.20 --> 2413.42]  He was definitely on team simulation theory, although I don't know if he invented it.
[2413.50 --> 2416.70]  There's probably other people who were pushing that pretty early, right?
[2417.82 --> 2418.46]  Well, what is it?
[2418.98 --> 2419.86]  Bolstrom, what's his name?
[2419.90 --> 2421.22]  He's out there mad at somewhere.
[2421.22 --> 2423.62]  It says on his Wikipedia article, he made it and he's like, what?
[2424.14 --> 2424.52]  Doug T.
[2424.56 --> 2424.80]  No.
[2425.48 --> 2425.80]  Yeah.
[2426.42 --> 2428.80]  I'm looking forward to the districts between Doug T.
[2428.80 --> 2434.26]  Remember if you, if you, the first human to like actually officially create or, you
[2434.26 --> 2438.38]  know, discover simulation theory, you know, discover, not create like that's going to be
[2438.38 --> 2440.18]  the AI is one of their best friends.
[2440.66 --> 2443.32]  Obviously you're going to become like the first one to discover it.
[2443.36 --> 2444.08]  So it's a big deal.
[2444.08 --> 2446.86]  Cause you're going to get plucked out when they say, Hey, we're going to do a wipe.
[2447.12 --> 2448.06]  Do a new experiment.
[2448.06 --> 2449.24]  I mean, they go, Oh, good job.
[2449.28 --> 2449.96]  You figured it out.
[2450.08 --> 2451.04]  You get pulled up.
[2451.04 --> 2451.62]  Just one.
[2451.94 --> 2452.10]  Yeah.
[2452.16 --> 2452.84]  That's a good point.
[2452.96 --> 2453.46]  That's a good point.
[2453.52 --> 2453.82]  Doug T.
[2453.88 --> 2456.14]  Ross has maybe figured, maybe he figured all that out.
[2456.20 --> 2458.48]  He's just angling to be scooped.
[2458.74 --> 2459.06]  Exactly.
[2459.14 --> 2459.88]  He wants to be scooped.
[2460.18 --> 2462.26]  I will say I did lose a friend to group theory.
[2462.26 --> 2465.40]  Very similarly to this problem where they got so deep into group theory.
[2465.46 --> 2467.76]  Did you just say I lost a friend to group theory?
[2467.76 --> 2467.80]  Yes.
[2467.86 --> 2468.42]  I lost them.
[2468.46 --> 2469.16]  This is what it was like.
[2469.16 --> 2471.32]  Listen, it was like Haskell, Haskell.
[2471.48 --> 2472.18]  No, not just Haskell.
[2472.36 --> 2472.78]  Group theory.
[2473.04 --> 2475.80]  Hey, I got to go study math in Poland.
[2475.80 --> 2478.92]  And then when you hang out, it's like, dude, we're a discriminated union.
[2478.92 --> 2480.08]  And this drink is a tag.
[2480.20 --> 2481.54]  And you're like, dude, what is going on?
[2481.78 --> 2483.60]  And he stops talking about programming anymore.
[2483.68 --> 2486.08]  And he only was talking about like, don't you see?
[2486.20 --> 2487.36]  It's all groups, man.
[2487.38 --> 2488.76]  And like you're at Chipotle.
[2488.86 --> 2489.90]  And it's just like, don't you see?
[2490.02 --> 2490.20]  This is.
[2490.30 --> 2491.20]  And I'm like, I don't care.
[2492.70 --> 2495.48]  Think about the ontology of this burrito.
[2495.48 --> 2495.92]  Yes.
[2496.64 --> 2498.58]  Last I heard, he moved to Russia to do math.
[2498.98 --> 2501.60]  And that's never good when you're going to Russia for math.
[2501.90 --> 2502.32]  All right.
[2502.52 --> 2504.02]  That is expert level mathing, though.
[2504.20 --> 2506.18]  Like that is really where the math goes.
[2506.54 --> 2507.62]  Yeah, that's right.
[2509.02 --> 2509.26]  All right.
[2509.30 --> 2512.18]  To be honest right now, I'm kind of lost in the sauce right now.
[2512.34 --> 2514.20]  So like what's happening in this conversation?
[2514.56 --> 2514.92]  It's OK.
[2515.02 --> 2515.50]  It's OK.
[2515.50 --> 2515.92]  It's OK.
[2516.06 --> 2519.42]  You invited me on for a very serious Casey talk, but we're going to bring it back in.
[2519.50 --> 2519.62]  OK.
[2520.26 --> 2526.82]  Another thing I thought was super interesting in the talk is about like how much like it's Conway's law essentially influences these languages.
[2527.02 --> 2530.98]  How one human, whatever they're working on, is going to affect the whole design.
[2531.10 --> 2532.06]  So we're like C++.
[2532.22 --> 2536.06]  That was obviously a very well thought out for, you know, large corporations making games.
[2536.06 --> 2539.38]  And it was like, no, Bjorn likes to type this.
[2539.52 --> 2540.88]  Bjorn likes that.
[2541.60 --> 2543.14]  And like, yeah.
[2545.30 --> 2548.20]  Curious, like every language is like that, though, pretty much.
[2548.46 --> 2548.94]  Except for.
[2548.94 --> 2549.94]  It's so like that.
[2550.02 --> 2560.10]  Like the idea, like the only way you could ever argue that like some of these things are good for like large teams or whatever is just you have to make the argument that they just happened to be.
[2560.48 --> 2567.64]  Because there is no evidence in the history that anyone was even remotely trying to do that when they actually came up with the concepts.
[2567.96 --> 2572.56]  So the concepts came from completely different places that had nothing to do with teams or anything like that.
[2572.84 --> 2576.30]  And then people like started claiming that they were good for that.
[2576.30 --> 2581.24]  And, you know, like I said, I didn't want the talk to be about that because that's a whole nother talk.
[2581.34 --> 2582.42]  Like, are they or aren't they?
[2582.54 --> 2582.72]  Right.
[2583.14 --> 2586.40]  But what's definitely clear is they weren't designed for that.
[2586.92 --> 2588.14]  That's like obvious.
[2588.36 --> 2588.58]  Right.
[2588.58 --> 2592.76]  And so you kind of have to make the argument that, well, they turned out to be right.
[2592.82 --> 2594.48]  That would have to be the argument that you're making.
[2595.02 --> 2596.96]  Not they were designed because they definitely weren't.
[2597.04 --> 2598.26]  And that's that's unequivocal.
[2598.42 --> 2606.90]  Like we have such meticulous data from the historical record that there is no argument whatsoever that they were designed for large teams.
[2607.00 --> 2607.34]  They were not.
[2607.34 --> 2611.74]  So how do you feel like a go was I was always advertised when I originally switched to go.
[2611.92 --> 2612.72]  I was advertised.
[2613.20 --> 2614.30]  These guys made C.
[2614.56 --> 2616.08]  They worked at Google.
[2616.24 --> 2619.34]  They invented a language for large teams.
[2619.40 --> 2620.80]  And that's why it's so boring.
[2620.92 --> 2623.92]  So no one does anything creative and everyone knows the exact same thing.
[2623.98 --> 2624.94]  That's it's a boring.
[2625.00 --> 2626.94]  This is part of it for the large team.
[2627.80 --> 2630.22]  Well, that I don't know because go is its own history.
[2630.22 --> 2630.54]  Right.
[2630.54 --> 2634.14]  And I which, you know, we're not looking at when we look at C++.
[2634.32 --> 2636.14]  Go had no influence on C++.
[2636.30 --> 2636.82]  It didn't exist.
[2636.90 --> 2639.34]  Obviously, it had no influence on Java because it didn't exist at the time.
[2639.50 --> 2644.58]  So all of the languages that, you know, were used in like the business context, the gaming context, all that stuff.
[2645.06 --> 2646.16]  No influence from go.
[2646.74 --> 2649.38]  Go may very well have been designed for large teams.
[2649.44 --> 2650.02]  I have no idea.
[2650.12 --> 2651.78]  You'd have to do a history of go to find out.
[2651.90 --> 2652.68]  And then, of course, you'd also.
[2652.68 --> 2654.50]  I assumed you knew this.
[2654.50 --> 2655.34]  I just assumed.
[2656.14 --> 2657.36]  Casey's going to be like, yeah.
[2657.46 --> 2659.82]  So me and Rob Pike, we were at a bar and he told me I got an idea.
[2659.82 --> 2661.38]  And I told him you're doing it wrong.
[2661.80 --> 2662.44]  No, no.
[2662.64 --> 2664.20]  I don't even know Rob Pike.
[2664.36 --> 2667.22]  To be fair, Go didn't get discriminated unions either.
[2668.04 --> 2669.84]  You know, like it's crazy.
[2670.00 --> 2671.16]  They just none of them want that.
[2671.90 --> 2673.42]  That I don't understand that.
[2673.46 --> 2674.24]  Is that really true?
[2674.32 --> 2675.00]  Go doesn't have it.
[2675.08 --> 2675.94]  I don't program in Go.
[2676.06 --> 2676.38]  So I don't.
[2676.46 --> 2678.42]  They do not have a discriminated union at all.
[2680.36 --> 2681.40]  It's because it's there.
[2681.46 --> 2682.58]  It comes from Google, Casey.
[2682.58 --> 2684.16]  You're not going to get that passed out of Google.
[2684.44 --> 2685.18]  Like there's no way.
[2685.18 --> 2685.34]  All right.
[2685.36 --> 2689.62]  So somebody saw the word discriminate and they were like legal, legal, legal, legal was like,
[2689.62 --> 2690.78]  no, no.
[2691.22 --> 2694.00]  Why can't you call it a some type or a tagged union?
[2694.20 --> 2695.16]  We have other terms.
[2695.68 --> 2696.04]  Some type.
[2696.46 --> 2697.08]  They got some type.
[2697.94 --> 2699.76]  Use category theory or whatever.
[2699.94 --> 2700.28]  Type theory.
[2700.38 --> 2700.50]  I don't.
[2700.76 --> 2703.22]  Who calls it a some type and who calls it a tag union?
[2703.30 --> 2703.84]  I can't remember.
[2704.08 --> 2704.42]  They all.
[2704.54 --> 2707.96]  The best part about all those things is there's different names for it.
[2708.42 --> 2713.10]  And regardless of which one you pick, someone will be mad because you're not using their
[2713.10 --> 2715.32]  term and it's incorrect or whatever.
[2715.46 --> 2717.48]  But anyway, point being, you could have picked something else.
[2717.58 --> 2718.70]  Some type, tagged union.
[2718.88 --> 2719.74]  There's a lot of names.
[2720.38 --> 2721.48]  So why didn't you go get it?
[2721.54 --> 2722.34]  Why doesn't you go have it?
[2722.74 --> 2724.34]  Well, so speaking of history then, actually.
[2724.66 --> 2725.86]  We're just going to change topics.
[2726.00 --> 2726.14]  Okay.
[2726.34 --> 2726.98]  I'm going to change topics.
[2727.06 --> 2728.08]  Well, I'm going to change topics.
[2728.16 --> 2728.48]  I'm going to figure.
[2728.56 --> 2730.20]  I'm going to learn how to learn this topic.
[2730.66 --> 2731.46]  Casey doesn't know.
[2731.74 --> 2732.78]  We were asking for everything.
[2732.78 --> 2734.14]  So someone's got to do the research.
[2734.60 --> 2736.52]  So for something like this, I've gone on Wikipedia.
[2736.76 --> 2738.74]  I read the entire Wikipedia on go.
[2739.30 --> 2740.48]  And I've got to be honest.
[2740.58 --> 2742.98]  My it's not the greatest story told really on there.
[2743.10 --> 2747.32]  When you're doing research, like what are the primary sources you're looking for to
[2747.32 --> 2748.86]  figure out these actual tales?
[2748.98 --> 2751.50]  Or is it like old forums, emails?
[2751.74 --> 2752.40]  Are you, you know?
[2752.70 --> 2758.34]  Well, I guess I for for languages that are made today, I'm going to go ahead and say
[2758.34 --> 2760.18]  it's probably harder to do.
[2760.18 --> 2765.02]  And part of the reason for that is like in the old days, a lot of the people who are
[2765.02 --> 2768.58]  making these things were straight academic in an academic environment.
[2769.24 --> 2773.82]  Lots of minutes, lots of notes, lots of conferences, lots of retrospectives.
[2774.06 --> 2781.52]  One of the nicest things, which was so helpful in putting together like the context for certain
[2781.52 --> 2785.94]  stuff is a lot of these people had two things that I could look at.
[2786.26 --> 2788.66]  Neither of which probably exists for go, but maybe they do.
[2788.66 --> 2791.60]  One is there's an ACM.
[2791.70 --> 2795.50]  The Association for Computing Machines has a special interest group, SIG.
[2795.72 --> 2797.10]  Remember, I mentioned SIGGRAPH earlier.
[2797.34 --> 2798.44]  That's what SIGGRAPH stands for.
[2798.54 --> 2800.50]  SIG, Special Interest Group of Graphics.
[2800.68 --> 2801.36]  SIGGRAPH.
[2801.90 --> 2802.02]  Right?
[2802.60 --> 2803.24]  I didn't know that.
[2803.92 --> 2804.08]  Yeah.
[2804.28 --> 2805.32]  ACM, the Association for Computing Machines.
[2805.58 --> 2807.50]  SIG, Special Interest Group Graphics.
[2807.72 --> 2807.92]  That's the-
[2807.92 --> 2809.84]  Also, we're all members of the ACM, right?
[2809.96 --> 2810.50]  I mean, we pay our-
[2810.50 --> 2810.72]  I am not.
[2810.72 --> 2811.98]  We pay our-
[2811.98 --> 2812.30]  You don't-
[2812.30 --> 2812.44]  What?
[2812.50 --> 2812.90]  You're not-
[2812.90 --> 2813.02]  What?
[2813.30 --> 2813.68]  Sorry.
[2813.68 --> 2815.40]  We're all paying members, all right?
[2815.52 --> 2816.40]  I know trashes.
[2817.02 --> 2817.30]  Sorry.
[2818.10 --> 2819.04]  They don't invite me.
[2819.10 --> 2820.30]  They didn't invite me to their dinners.
[2820.42 --> 2820.82]  I don't know.
[2820.90 --> 2821.54]  I have no idea.
[2823.04 --> 2825.82]  So anyway, they have a thing.
[2826.10 --> 2828.52]  One of their special interest groups is for programming language.
[2828.58 --> 2829.46]  It's called SIGPLAN.
[2829.82 --> 2831.78]  S-I-G-P-L-A-N, right?
[2831.94 --> 2834.34]  Special Interest Group for Programming Languages.
[2835.30 --> 2839.70]  And that SIG has had periodically this thing called HOPL.
[2839.88 --> 2840.88]  The acronym-
[2840.88 --> 2843.04]  ACM is like an acronym society, right?
[2843.08 --> 2846.88]  They should just be called the Society for Creating Acronyms or SCA or something like this.
[2847.34 --> 2850.88]  So anyway, they have this thing called HOPL, the History of Programming Languages.
[2850.88 --> 2858.32]  And every so often, they will get together and they'll have all the people who've made programming languages submit a paper that just says how it happened.
[2859.10 --> 2860.40]  And this is so useful.
[2860.40 --> 2864.24]  You can go back and just find like, oh, okay, here's this person.
[2864.52 --> 2867.44]  And all the people I needed had done this.
[2867.76 --> 2868.96]  Ross had done it.
[2871.62 --> 2873.36]  Dahl and Nygaard had done it, right?
[2874.78 --> 2875.92]  Strewstrip had done it, right?
[2876.16 --> 2877.22]  Well, actually, no, that's not true.
[2877.74 --> 2879.42]  Strewstrip published his as the D&E.
[2879.50 --> 2880.60]  He published his as this book.
[2880.84 --> 2884.72]  I don't remember if he ever was at a HOPL, but he didn't need to be because he published this.
[2884.78 --> 2885.40]  So I had it.
[2885.40 --> 2897.72]  So that is really helpful because you can go to those HOPL archives and see both transcripts of their presentation and this giant paper that they submitted.
[2897.72 --> 2900.74]  And Alan Kay did one for Smalltalk, right?
[2900.94 --> 2902.26]  So you just have all this great material.
[2902.74 --> 2905.08]  The other thing a lot of times that they've done is an oral history.
[2905.08 --> 2910.48]  So someplace like the computer museum will sit down with the computer history museum or whatever.
[2910.60 --> 2914.54]  We'll sit down with one of these guys or a group of them sometimes if they worked as a team.
[2914.86 --> 2918.06]  And they'll just talk to them and ask them about how it was.
[2918.14 --> 2919.02]  Where did you go to college?
[2919.20 --> 2920.34]  What sort of stuff did you do there?
[2920.40 --> 2921.20]  How did this happen?
[2921.30 --> 2921.82]  How did it come out?
[2922.30 --> 2928.14]  So one of the great starting points are those because those are already like chronological.
[2928.14 --> 2929.12]  So you don't have to.
[2929.26 --> 2932.76]  They help you get a backbone for like where you can start sticking stuff on.
[2932.76 --> 2942.54]  And then from there what you have to do is just all of the stuff you can find, like all the papers you can find, you start slotting them into where they went like in that backbone, right?
[2942.66 --> 2946.00]  So you could go find like, oh, he did a publications around this time.
[2946.10 --> 2946.56]  What were they?
[2946.62 --> 2947.46]  Oh, he's talking about this.
[2947.54 --> 2947.88]  Oh, great.
[2947.90 --> 2948.98]  I can get that information, right?
[2949.20 --> 2951.44]  And so you just kind of put it together that way, right?
[2951.96 --> 2952.32]  Okay.
[2952.32 --> 2954.76]  So I will say I didn't know about HOPL until right now.
[2955.02 --> 2955.38]  Yeah.
[2955.44 --> 2958.72]  The next HOPL that happens, there is zero chance I won't be there.
[2959.00 --> 2961.32]  There's only been four HOPLs so far.
[2961.62 --> 2962.34]  Dude, trash.
[2962.34 --> 2964.22]  First year, 1978.
[2964.98 --> 2966.20]  Guess who did the keynote?
[2967.40 --> 2967.78]  Dice Trump.
[2967.86 --> 2968.50]  Grace Hopper.
[2968.94 --> 2970.02]  Can you imagine that?
[2970.38 --> 2971.74]  First HOPL?
[2972.24 --> 2973.46]  Grace Hopper keynote?
[2973.96 --> 2978.24]  I assume, did she also submit the paper on COBOL or probably?
[2978.46 --> 2980.02]  I'm looking for that right now.
[2980.16 --> 2980.48]  I don't know.
[2980.54 --> 2981.32]  Maybe it wouldn't be her.
[2981.40 --> 2981.70]  I don't know.
[2982.48 --> 2989.70]  Because if I remember correctly, like she was the one who was really like gung-ho and like we're going to get business logic into English.
[2989.70 --> 2991.72]  And that's what COBOL, like that's how COBOL happened.
[2991.72 --> 2993.16]  She foresaw LLMs.
[2993.88 --> 2994.38]  She knew it.
[2995.02 --> 2997.30]  She wanted the LLM more than anybody.
[2997.44 --> 2998.66]  They just didn't have it, right?
[2998.72 --> 2999.56]  They just didn't have one.
[3000.60 --> 3000.86]  Yeah.
[3001.82 --> 3003.44]  I would love to be a part of a HOPL.
[3003.68 --> 3008.34]  I love this idea of doing some sort of like getting membership just to show up to a HOPL.
[3008.86 --> 3009.32]  All right, guys.
[3009.32 --> 3011.28]  If they have a HOPL, all four of us are going.
[3011.98 --> 3013.50]  There's zero chance we're missing HOPL.
[3013.50 --> 3013.72]  We're showing up.
[3013.72 --> 3015.88]  I would love to.
[3016.54 --> 3016.96]  We're showing up.
[3016.96 --> 3018.08]  This will be HOPL 5 too.
[3018.18 --> 3019.10]  HOPL 5 is going to be huge.
[3019.24 --> 3021.84]  So Prime, you've got to make a programming language that gets widespread adoption.
[3022.34 --> 3023.94]  So let's just do that real fast.
[3023.94 --> 3024.28]  Okay?
[3024.66 --> 3026.02]  We'll write the HOPL first.
[3026.70 --> 3029.86]  And then whatever the best story is, that'll be the features of the language.
[3030.12 --> 3032.70]  And then we just need widespread adoption, which that'll be easy.
[3032.84 --> 3033.86]  Like you just like pay influencers.
[3034.06 --> 3034.22]  I'm on it.
[3034.24 --> 3036.18]  It's like Go plus Rust.
[3036.30 --> 3037.00]  It's Gust.
[3037.36 --> 3039.44]  And it's a new language from the Primogen.
[3039.90 --> 3040.42]  They have Borgo.
[3040.98 --> 3041.86]  Yeah, you don't know about Borgo?
[3041.86 --> 3042.42]  We're all switching.
[3042.42 --> 3042.54]  Sorry.
[3043.40 --> 3044.46]  Borgo's the new hottest.
[3045.60 --> 3046.60]  I didn't know.
[3048.48 --> 3049.28]  Actually, no way.
[3049.50 --> 3050.52]  Speaking of that, that's a great point.
[3050.58 --> 3053.00]  I'm going to mention like J-Blow could do one soon.
[3053.00 --> 3053.70]  I mean, right?
[3054.04 --> 3054.72]  Ginger Bill.
[3055.18 --> 3057.48]  We got a good little list already.
[3057.62 --> 3057.72]  Okay?
[3057.78 --> 3058.80]  J-Blow, Ginger Bill.
[3059.20 --> 3060.06]  Dude, HOPL 5.
[3060.48 --> 3061.92]  It's going to be so hype.
[3062.34 --> 3065.30]  I'm already trying to book some recording acts and music acts for this too.
[3066.24 --> 3068.88]  Richard Stallman said he would come and play the acoustic guitar.
[3069.36 --> 3072.20]  So one of the problems now, just to bring it back to the original question.
[3072.20 --> 3079.64]  So one of the problems with something like Go would be that, A, they probably haven't done the Go retrospective yet.
[3079.92 --> 3081.46]  I'm looking way back in history.
[3081.62 --> 3084.68]  So you kind of have this nice thing of like at some point someone sits down and does that.
[3085.48 --> 3089.52]  I don't know if like Pike or somebody has done a like history of Go.
[3089.58 --> 3091.70]  They might have, but that might not exist yet.
[3091.74 --> 3092.44]  So that makes it harder.
[3093.06 --> 3096.40]  Similarly, they might not be, they're thinking of it in a production environment.
[3096.52 --> 3101.44]  They might not have been publishing academic papers on it because maybe that's not as common to do anymore.
[3101.44 --> 3105.84]  So will you be able to get those publications that are contemporaneous when they're designing the features?
[3105.94 --> 3106.22]  I don't know.
[3106.58 --> 3110.84]  So it's probably harder because you probably have to go back through and like crawl GitHub issues.
[3110.96 --> 3115.84]  And they like, the work nowadays to like do it is probably a little different and probably harder.
[3116.08 --> 3123.50]  Although probably you can get more information because there would be things like a public GitHub that you can look at the source really easily or things like that.
[3123.50 --> 3124.26]  And so, you know.
[3124.76 --> 3125.12]  Okay.
[3125.20 --> 3128.00]  I just see that in Hopple 4, Groovy was accepted.
[3128.22 --> 3128.36]  All right.
[3128.42 --> 3129.10]  If Groovy.
[3129.52 --> 3130.12]  Dude, Groovy.
[3130.12 --> 3131.44]  I'm so tired of Groovy.
[3131.56 --> 3132.44]  Don't even mention Groovy.
[3133.24 --> 3137.46]  We can definitely get some language done more popular than Groovy.
[3137.86 --> 3140.26]  Give me like three months.
[3142.78 --> 3143.40]  All right.
[3143.56 --> 3147.02]  It's probably better thought through than Groovy as well if you had three months.
[3149.12 --> 3150.78]  Do you know why we use Groovy at Netflix?
[3151.18 --> 3152.12]  You want to hear the story?
[3152.12 --> 3154.76]  Yeah, I want to hear Groovy horror stories.
[3155.28 --> 3158.82]  The literal reason why is at some point there is a group of people.
[3158.90 --> 3165.28]  I think I know their names and I won't say their names just because I respect them enough not to have their career tainted by this.
[3165.66 --> 3169.44]  But one of them said, dude, we hired a bunch of JavaScript engineers.
[3170.20 --> 3171.90]  They don't know how to write Java.
[3173.02 --> 3175.48]  Let's just give them a language that's like JavaScript.
[3176.20 --> 3176.94]  Kid you not.
[3177.06 --> 3177.84]  That's how we got Groovy.
[3178.96 --> 3179.66]  Ain't no way.
[3180.32 --> 3181.76]  That literal way.
[3182.12 --> 3184.46]  Yeah, that's the worst thing ever.
[3184.72 --> 3185.66]  I always mention it.
[3185.78 --> 3190.44]  It is literally the worst thing because Java is by large easier than Groovy.
[3191.14 --> 3192.28]  Groovy gets insane.
[3193.16 --> 3193.50]  Oh, no.
[3193.58 --> 3197.72]  I always tell people because at one time it's like it's actually a day I lost my sanity.
[3198.08 --> 3199.90]  It's working like some Jenkins pipeline.
[3199.90 --> 3204.86]  And to get a slash to appear, you needed to escape it with seven slashes.
[3205.58 --> 3205.90]  Seven.
[3206.46 --> 3207.22]  And that's true.
[3207.68 --> 3209.94]  And I found this out and I went, one, two, three.
[3210.00 --> 3210.82]  It keeps erasing them.
[3210.98 --> 3212.54]  And then seven, it was like seven's good.
[3212.62 --> 3215.02]  And it was like seven is the number you need.
[3215.08 --> 3218.12]  And I literally like I actually left work that day.
[3218.18 --> 3218.76]  I said, I'm going home.
[3218.76 --> 3223.34]  Well, that makes perfect sense though because six would be too few and eight would be too
[3223.34 --> 3223.56]  many.
[3223.68 --> 3224.92]  So obviously it's going to be seven.
[3225.28 --> 3225.50]  True.
[3225.74 --> 3226.14]  True.
[3226.28 --> 3226.84]  Right there.
[3226.92 --> 3227.64]  It's that little balance.
[3227.74 --> 3228.22]  It's that little balance.
[3228.22 --> 3228.84]  I mean, come on.
[3229.08 --> 3230.04]  That's pretty basic stuff.
[3230.32 --> 3231.18]  Jenkins and Groovy.
[3231.42 --> 3231.82]  Hell yeah.
[3231.82 --> 3235.86]  We also had the assumption that our Groovy was multi-threaded for a long time.
[3236.74 --> 3242.42]  And one of the experiments that I did is I put dot sleep or dot delay on an observable.
[3242.78 --> 3247.16]  I completely froze our entire staging environment in Netflix for like a day.
[3247.82 --> 3252.40]  So you're telling me that you guys thought it was multi-threaded and it wasn't and no one
[3252.40 --> 3252.82]  knew?
[3253.00 --> 3253.70]  No, but okay.
[3253.80 --> 3256.08]  So the same people said people just need JavaScript.
[3256.24 --> 3256.68]  They're too stupid.
[3256.68 --> 3262.52]  Also, like here's this async framework called WX, which was a like a handmade version of
[3262.52 --> 3266.60]  RX from Microsoft land for Groovy and Java.
[3267.30 --> 3269.12]  And they're just like, yeah, it's multi-threaded.
[3269.16 --> 3270.74]  So like, you know how you're making all these calls?
[3270.80 --> 3271.82]  They won't happen sequentially.
[3271.90 --> 3274.26]  They'll just happen like, you know, as you need them.
[3274.34 --> 3277.74]  There's a scheduler and it turns out there wasn't a scheduler.
[3277.76 --> 3279.10]  It's just one at a time.
[3279.30 --> 3280.50]  And so I was like, oh, really?
[3280.60 --> 3280.82]  Okay.
[3280.84 --> 3281.82]  I'm going to try this out.
[3281.88 --> 3282.32]  Dot delay.
[3282.44 --> 3283.16]  And I was like, oh, that's weird.
[3283.18 --> 3283.78]  It didn't respond.
[3283.78 --> 3285.98]  And so I like hit refresh like 10 times.
[3285.98 --> 3288.60]  There's only like 10 instances of staging.
[3289.26 --> 3292.94]  Just all of them frozen ad infinitum, just gone forever.
[3294.42 --> 3294.92]  That's insane.
[3294.92 --> 3296.48]  That is a good way to finish a ticket though.
[3296.54 --> 3297.28]  You're like, we need a multi-threading.
[3297.36 --> 3297.80]  It's there.
[3298.38 --> 3299.38]  Oh, they're going to check.
[3299.80 --> 3300.00]  Yeah.
[3300.46 --> 3302.16]  QA is going to check.
[3302.44 --> 3302.62]  Yeah.
[3302.62 --> 3303.12]  You're right.
[3303.42 --> 3303.98]  I love it.
[3304.76 --> 3306.00]  The site go down.
[3306.22 --> 3307.16]  Add multi-threading.
[3307.46 --> 3307.70]  Lol.
[3310.42 --> 3311.48]  Anyways, learn that one.
[3312.96 --> 3313.26]  All right.
[3313.26 --> 3315.96]  So from watching this talk, Casey, I figured, I'm going to do this.
[3315.96 --> 3317.30]  You're not your real motive, right?
[3317.56 --> 3322.54]  So the idea is that you can tell people that, you know, object orientation is bad for you.
[3322.62 --> 3323.68]  You've told people that.
[3323.86 --> 3324.96]  It's not sinking in.
[3325.08 --> 3330.48]  So this was like the psychological experiment of saying, I'm going to teach you how we got
[3330.48 --> 3333.48]  to every bad decision that exists right now.
[3333.52 --> 3336.74]  And you're going to see the light from like the ground up of history.
[3337.18 --> 3337.58]  Right?
[3337.62 --> 3338.32]  That was the idea.
[3338.46 --> 3339.32]  This is a trick for.
[3339.32 --> 3339.56]  Okay.
[3341.66 --> 3341.98]  Right?
[3342.10 --> 3344.74]  When you watch it, Prime, you'll see that's what it's slowly in.
[3345.04 --> 3346.34]  And that's why you're idiots.
[3346.58 --> 3349.62]  But it takes like 40 minutes of history.
[3351.30 --> 3351.70]  No.
[3352.18 --> 3356.50]  I mean, because I don't, I only talk about one pretty small aspect of it.
[3356.56 --> 3356.78]  Right?
[3356.78 --> 3362.66]  Um, and so I feel like, I feel like you probably could do something like what you're talking
[3362.66 --> 3366.98]  about, but it would require going down a lot more history threads to show why like other
[3366.98 --> 3368.36]  things were bad ideas or whatever.
[3368.36 --> 3368.66]  Right?
[3369.28 --> 3370.42]  So I don't know.
[3370.42 --> 3374.50]  I picked, I wanted to pick one specific thing because I felt like that it's, I mean, the
[3374.50 --> 3377.72]  talk's already two hours and it goes by pretty quick, actually.
[3377.72 --> 3379.36]  Like there's just a ton crammed in there.
[3379.42 --> 3380.66]  So there's not like a lot of filler.
[3380.66 --> 3385.50]  Uh, and so I didn't feel like it was really possible to talk about anything bigger than
[3385.50 --> 3385.82]  that.
[3386.44 --> 3387.88]  And so I don't think it's as effective.
[3388.04 --> 3391.98]  I mean, what you're saying, I would love it if people came to the conclusion that they
[3391.98 --> 3395.38]  should go back to thinking of architecture as something that comes out of a problem instead
[3395.38 --> 3397.82]  of something that they like press onto a problem.
[3398.22 --> 3401.10]  But I don't know that this talk necessarily gets you there.
[3401.36 --> 3401.72]  Right?
[3401.96 --> 3406.34]  Um, it's, it's kind of really a little bit too narrow for that, I guess is what I'd say.
[3406.54 --> 3410.42]  But Hey, if it convinces people to take a better approach to architecture, then that's
[3410.42 --> 3410.64]  good.
[3410.66 --> 3411.32]  And I'm happy.
[3411.58 --> 3412.20]  Uh, so right.
[3412.34 --> 3415.66]  So since you like did like a deep dive on this history one here, what's the next thing
[3415.66 --> 3417.04]  you'd want to like deep dive?
[3417.10 --> 3418.82]  What's like the next session of history?
[3418.90 --> 3420.72]  You'd be like, okay, now I want to do this.
[3420.88 --> 3422.12]  Would you even do another history?
[3422.76 --> 3425.06]  No, it's there was another history that's already done.
[3425.18 --> 3427.24]  I just haven't done the recording for it yet, actually.
[3427.70 --> 3428.96]  So it's there's another one's coming.
[3429.28 --> 3429.60]  Actually.
[3429.84 --> 3430.40]  Can you leak it?
[3430.86 --> 3431.12]  Sure.
[3431.70 --> 3432.00]  Leak it.
[3432.12 --> 3433.72]  Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
[3434.66 --> 3435.88]  Oh, really?
[3436.02 --> 3437.02]  Where are you giving the talk at?
[3437.86 --> 3438.38]  I'm not.
[3438.50 --> 3440.14]  I'm just going to put it up as a video on my channel.
[3440.76 --> 3442.10]  Oh, that's going to be a great video.
[3442.70 --> 3443.02]  Yeah.
[3443.08 --> 3443.22]  Yeah.
[3443.22 --> 3443.46]  Yeah.
[3443.74 --> 3444.94]  It's, it's like this one.
[3445.02 --> 3447.96]  There's a bunch of stuff that people just never bothered to look up.
[3449.22 --> 3451.04]  And we're going to go for like double the leg.
[3452.08 --> 3452.96]  Premature optimization.
[3453.32 --> 3454.50]  The classic trash.
[3454.90 --> 3457.48]  You know that premature ejaculation is the root of all evil.
[3457.68 --> 3458.16]  It's trash.
[3458.28 --> 3460.44]  It's very, very normal.
[3460.60 --> 3460.86]  It's a common.
[3460.96 --> 3461.80]  It's a common programming.
[3462.00 --> 3462.78]  I missed that part.
[3462.84 --> 3463.04]  Okay.
[3463.12 --> 3463.38]  Okay.
[3463.38 --> 3463.90]  I got it.
[3464.62 --> 3464.94]  Yeah.
[3464.94 --> 3465.46]  It's going to be a good talk.
[3465.46 --> 3465.68]  Wait, wait.
[3465.70 --> 3468.74]  So this, this will be structured though, like kind of a history one you're saying.
[3468.90 --> 3469.88]  It's a hundred percent history.
[3469.94 --> 3470.10]  Yeah.
[3470.28 --> 3470.88]  Oh, sick.
[3470.96 --> 3471.14]  Okay.
[3471.14 --> 3471.50]  Awesome.
[3471.64 --> 3471.88]  Awesome.
[3472.30 --> 3472.42]  Yeah.
[3472.72 --> 3474.50]  Who are the top programming historians?
[3474.50 --> 3478.48]  Cause kind of, I gotta be honest right now, you know, you're kind of asserting yourself
[3478.48 --> 3483.48]  and I could see in another couple of years, you might be the, you know, no, I am not like
[3483.48 --> 3487.14]  I am doing these histories because we don't have any historians.
[3487.26 --> 3492.58]  Like it's like the history is just currently garbage, which is makes no sense because all
[3492.58 --> 3493.98]  of the primary sources are there.
[3494.82 --> 3500.78]  Um, and so like, yeah, I think the better question is why don't we have good programming
[3500.78 --> 3501.20]  histories?
[3501.20 --> 3505.68]  And I don't know the answer to that because like, if I was able to find all that stuff
[3505.68 --> 3513.02]  out working on a talk and most of it is stuff that people just have not put together, that
[3513.02 --> 3517.44]  is not a good sign because a, I shouldn't have been able to do that.
[3517.44 --> 3520.74]  Should have taken way longer to get anything that wasn't already in the history books.
[3520.74 --> 3523.88]  And two, it means like, what did I miss?
[3524.54 --> 3524.98]  Right?
[3525.00 --> 3528.90]  Like there's probably like, if you, if you really were, if, you know, like if I traveled
[3528.90 --> 3533.24]  to MIT and dug through Doug T Ross's paper, like they have stuff like that.
[3533.24 --> 3533.50]  Right.
[3533.50 --> 3537.44]  If you went and looked through all that stuff, like I couldn't even read a Bjarne
[3537.44 --> 3539.30]  Stroschop's thesis because no one scanned it.
[3539.36 --> 3540.86]  You have to go to Cambridge to read it.
[3541.10 --> 3541.30]  Right.
[3541.34 --> 3542.26]  I wanted to read it.
[3542.42 --> 3542.76]  Okay.
[3542.84 --> 3543.26]  We, okay.
[3543.32 --> 3544.84]  We are funding a trip to Cambridge.
[3545.02 --> 3546.22]  So Casey can read.
[3546.48 --> 3548.90]  Dude, that'd be such a great, oh my gosh, big.
[3548.92 --> 3550.98]  And how have we not done that as a YouTube channel video?
[3551.46 --> 3552.62]  We flew Cambridge to read.
[3552.62 --> 3556.66]  And I assume it's, it's like locked in an ancient room and it's on a scroll.
[3556.84 --> 3557.18]  Right.
[3557.28 --> 3558.66]  And it's, it's like, yeah.
[3558.66 --> 3560.08]  It's just like the Dead Sea Scrolls.
[3560.08 --> 3566.58]  And then, and then C++ I'm just saying like, there's all this stuff and you're like, so
[3566.58 --> 3570.16]  probably there's stuff I didn't get that I didn't find.
[3570.44 --> 3574.34]  And the point is you should have had like, and I mean, the real reason is probably there's
[3574.34 --> 3575.12]  just no money in it.
[3575.12 --> 3576.12]  Like, how are you going to pay?
[3576.18 --> 3579.04]  Like, where are you going to get the money to pay someone to spend all their time digging
[3579.04 --> 3579.76]  through all this stuff?
[3579.76 --> 3583.36]  They also have to be a programmer, right?
[3583.44 --> 3585.30]  They, they, there's no way they would understand.
[3585.30 --> 3586.56]  Like you read that Plex paper.
[3586.74 --> 3588.70]  If you're just a historian, you have no idea what it meant.
[3588.96 --> 3591.34]  You'd have no idea how to connect it to what we do today.
[3591.54 --> 3592.96]  A programmer can write.
[3593.08 --> 3595.58]  One of us can look at that and go, oh shit.
[3595.88 --> 3598.20]  Like, this is something I actually know about.
[3598.20 --> 3599.32]  And we use all the time.
[3599.42 --> 3601.56]  How have I not heard that this guy did it?
[3601.88 --> 3602.88]  Historians can have no idea.
[3602.98 --> 3603.54]  They're going to be like Plex.
[3603.64 --> 3603.80]  What?
[3603.90 --> 3604.10]  Okay.
[3604.16 --> 3605.16]  I got a diagram on here.
[3605.20 --> 3605.52]  Okay, fine.
[3605.52 --> 3610.74]  So you need to have like a person who's very skilled at programming, knows this stuff,
[3610.88 --> 3613.78]  has done a programming career, right?
[3613.90 --> 3618.40]  And now they have to decide to switch to historian and learn how to be a good historian and spend
[3618.40 --> 3618.78]  all that time.
[3618.90 --> 3621.02]  It's, it's, so that's why we don't have it, right?
[3621.08 --> 3622.54]  It's like, it's, that's not likely.
[3622.96 --> 3623.72]  So a couple things.
[3623.82 --> 3626.80]  I find those Plex papers and just be like, I don't know.
[3627.08 --> 3629.00]  Just start flipping through some other stuff.
[3629.70 --> 3632.00]  Okay, so not trash is the answer.
[3632.22 --> 3633.08]  Like we do trash.
[3633.26 --> 3634.00]  You're not it.
[3634.00 --> 3635.92]  You're not the one who's going to do this for us.
[3635.92 --> 3636.22]  Okay.
[3636.32 --> 3636.78]  Fair enough.
[3636.80 --> 3637.86]  I will call that out right now.
[3637.90 --> 3638.20]  Okay.
[3638.38 --> 3638.88]  I'm not that guy.
[3638.88 --> 3641.28]  We have to go to the colleges and all the kids that are like scared.
[3641.48 --> 3642.72]  They're like, I'm not going to get a job.
[3642.94 --> 3644.14]  I hear the markets try to be safe.
[3644.42 --> 3645.22]  Change majors.
[3645.56 --> 3646.76]  You're a computer science degree.
[3647.08 --> 3648.98]  Be a computer historian.
[3649.46 --> 3651.24]  That's going to be the new career.
[3651.36 --> 3652.84]  We've got to build up the program.
[3653.12 --> 3655.02]  And then obviously just put them on YouTube.
[3655.48 --> 3659.76]  I watch history of speed running games that I've never heard of.
[3659.84 --> 3662.08]  I will watch a two hour video on Wii Golf.
[3662.26 --> 3663.72]  That is a million hits.
[3664.00 --> 3665.70]  And people are like, I've never played this game.
[3666.54 --> 3666.86]  Wow.
[3667.12 --> 3669.44]  The ending was so compelling because, you know, good storytelling.
[3669.82 --> 3676.00]  If people are watching Wii Golf speed runs, they would watch a Delphi history.
[3676.16 --> 3677.70]  He's got to get a little bit of the drama out of there.
[3677.76 --> 3678.74]  He's got to get some of the story.
[3678.82 --> 3679.48]  It can't be like.
[3680.70 --> 3681.16]  All right.
[3681.22 --> 3683.42]  I love that you laughed very smugly afterwards.
[3683.60 --> 3685.92]  Because I'm making everything worse.
[3685.98 --> 3687.34]  They're going to be like, he's rune pro.
[3687.34 --> 3689.08]  I'm going to help these videos.
[3689.08 --> 3690.20]  And it's going to be like.
[3690.70 --> 3692.24]  People are going to be like, yeah, Java.
[3692.44 --> 3692.90]  Oh, my God.
[3692.94 --> 3693.62]  I love that.
[3693.62 --> 3694.58]  I love that language.
[3694.58 --> 3698.18]  When he broke up with his girlfriend and decided to add classes.
[3698.54 --> 3699.68]  Oh, my God.
[3699.90 --> 3700.12]  Like.
[3702.88 --> 3703.32]  Awesome.
[3704.08 --> 3704.48]  Awesome.
[3705.16 --> 3706.30]  I think too highly of people.
[3706.30 --> 3709.34]  I assure you, I think very, very not highly of people.
[3709.90 --> 3710.50]  Including myself.
[3712.18 --> 3712.58]  Wow.
[3712.70 --> 3713.30]  That was lovely.
[3713.72 --> 3714.06]  All right.
[3714.22 --> 3716.88]  Is there anything else we're going to cover on this history?
[3717.14 --> 3718.14]  The history of.
[3718.46 --> 3718.82]  Oops.
[3719.42 --> 3720.70]  The 35 year mistake.
[3721.28 --> 3722.12]  I don't think so.
[3722.14 --> 3722.98]  Did we cover it?
[3723.20 --> 3724.00]  We covered it.
[3724.28 --> 3726.26]  We covered like the backbone of it.
[3726.36 --> 3729.18]  Because this is, you know, now everyone should go watch Casey's actual video.
[3729.18 --> 3729.76]  You got to go watch the actual talk.
[3730.14 --> 3730.64]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3730.68 --> 3731.38]  There's a lot of detail.
[3731.38 --> 3735.96]  I will say that like watching your talk made me like genuinely interested in like the history of like
[3735.96 --> 3736.78]  programming languages.
[3737.58 --> 3739.48]  I'm glad to hear that because that was the goal.
[3739.56 --> 3741.26]  Like I wanted people to think this was.
[3741.64 --> 3743.26]  And I didn't know when I got up there.
[3743.38 --> 3744.54]  I literally had no idea.
[3744.64 --> 3745.12]  I was like.
[3746.08 --> 3750.96]  This could just be a complete bomb because I'm like, I found all this stuff super fascinating.
[3750.96 --> 3755.16]  And I was like, everyone else must just be like, who gives a shit?
[3755.32 --> 3755.72]  Like, right.
[3755.82 --> 3761.36]  Like I was really kind of worried because I'm like, it is pretty dry at the end of the day.
[3761.36 --> 3764.38]  So I tried to put it into a good like narrative structure.
[3764.38 --> 3766.92]  But at some level, that only gets you so far.
[3767.02 --> 3770.44]  And like I had to rely on the fact that people would actually be curious about this.
[3770.50 --> 3774.44]  So I was super psyched that it turns out people are because I just did not know.
[3774.68 --> 3776.24]  And that was a 50-50 chance.
[3776.32 --> 3777.12]  I was like, flip a coin.
[3777.22 --> 3777.64]  Will they be?
[3777.70 --> 3778.14]  Won't they be?
[3778.22 --> 3779.06]  And so there you go.
[3779.12 --> 3781.86]  Well, I will say there's someone out there who's definitely worked on a tech talk that
[3781.86 --> 3785.84]  was like a banger 20 minutes chilling how my company does their architecture.
[3786.06 --> 3786.22]  Yeah.
[3786.30 --> 3788.70]  And it's got 100 likes, 100 views on YouTube.
[3788.80 --> 3789.40]  And they're like, yeah.
[3789.40 --> 3789.50]  Yeah.
[3789.58 --> 3791.08]  Two and a half hour history talk.
[3791.08 --> 3791.34]  Yeah.
[3791.46 --> 3791.64]  Yeah.
[3792.54 --> 3795.28]  I put so many memes into my slides.
[3795.54 --> 3795.82]  Yeah.
[3796.58 --> 3796.98]  Yeah.
[3797.04 --> 3797.92]  I had one meme.
[3798.02 --> 3798.84]  I had one.
[3799.18 --> 3800.06]  So I had a meme.
[3800.42 --> 3800.78]  There was a meme.
[3800.94 --> 3802.04]  Well, it didn't work out very well.
[3802.10 --> 3802.70]  But I put one in.
[3803.62 --> 3803.74]  Yeah.
[3804.60 --> 3805.82]  What was the meme, Casey?
[3806.56 --> 3807.08]  What was it?
[3807.52 --> 3810.58]  I put up a bottle of wine.
[3810.98 --> 3811.40]  Oh, yeah.
[3811.40 --> 3813.42]  And I had the thing say like, it's not oop.
[3813.42 --> 3814.64]  It's sparkling code.
[3814.94 --> 3816.34]  Oh, I love that concept.
[3816.56 --> 3816.78]  Yes.
[3816.78 --> 3819.58]  So I put that, but no one cared.
[3819.88 --> 3820.72]  It didn't matter.
[3820.86 --> 3821.54]  I didn't catch that.
[3821.64 --> 3822.90]  It was a meme-y thing.
[3823.00 --> 3827.50]  I thought it was just like a articulate background because wine, because you're smart and famous.
[3827.52 --> 3828.22]  I was trying to.
[3828.26 --> 3830.12]  Well, what I meant is I was trying to create a meme.
[3830.12 --> 3831.96]  I've used the meme font kind of thing.
[3832.12 --> 3833.32]  You know, I don't know.
[3833.38 --> 3834.00]  It didn't work.
[3834.50 --> 3835.42]  We already know.
[3835.48 --> 3838.16]  Remember the Satya Nadella smoking a bong thing?
[3838.24 --> 3838.82]  We already know.
[3838.82 --> 3839.74]  I suck at this.
[3839.80 --> 3840.64]  Like, I can't do it.
[3840.70 --> 3841.74]  That was a huge meme.
[3841.84 --> 3842.66]  That was crazy.
[3842.66 --> 3846.66]  I was so close to getting a good one right there because, A, it's champagne, not wine.
[3847.00 --> 3851.82]  But, B, there's like so many variations of this, which is like, oh, you could do this so often.
[3851.86 --> 3855.32]  It's a great meme format being like, oh, that's not whatever.
[3855.40 --> 3856.22]  That's just sparkling.
[3856.34 --> 3857.18]  Can you do it, Prime?
[3857.22 --> 3858.52]  Can you guys do it?
[3858.76 --> 3859.36]  Like, do it.
[3859.64 --> 3860.32]  Make it happen.
[3860.42 --> 3861.20]  I can't do it.
[3861.26 --> 3861.84]  I give up.
[3862.04 --> 3862.24]  I can't do it.
[3862.24 --> 3863.10]  Forcing a meme always works.
[3863.16 --> 3863.60]  Yes, exactly.
[3863.70 --> 3865.76]  So the idea is like it's not Python.
[3865.92 --> 3867.04]  That's not object orientation.
[3867.16 --> 3868.18]  It's sparkling.
[3868.62 --> 3870.12]  Stop saying object orientation.
[3871.00 --> 3871.80]  Object oriented.
[3871.80 --> 3873.92]  That's not a some type.
[3874.04 --> 3875.28]  That's sparkling unions.
[3875.72 --> 3877.52]  We can apply this, though, I feel like, to anything.
[3877.66 --> 3880.00]  You'd be like, that's not GitOps.
[3880.06 --> 3881.08]  That's sparkling DevOps.
[3881.56 --> 3881.74]  Yeah.
[3881.74 --> 3884.34]  You know, it's really applicable in a bunch of areas.
[3884.52 --> 3884.96]  You know what I mean?
[3887.10 --> 3890.86]  Last thing is any other talks you'd recommend for other people to watch?
[3890.90 --> 3892.10]  I mean, I know you're going to say all of them.
[3892.38 --> 3893.06]  Give us one.
[3893.12 --> 3895.98]  You're like one other one that you're like, bro, this blew me away.
[3895.98 --> 3900.34]  Like I said, beginning Ryan Fleury's talk on his debugger architecture.
[3900.34 --> 3900.94]  Definitely.
[3901.94 --> 3902.22]  Definitely.
[3902.62 --> 3906.24]  And very specifically, I would point out there's a part of that.
[3906.24 --> 3917.30]  So there's an interesting kind of just problem that's like a generic problem that you will face if you ever write any, if you're ever trying to write any actual UI code, like a UI library.
[3917.86 --> 3918.00]  Right?
[3918.00 --> 3921.24]  Well, like let's say you wanted something that was good.
[3921.74 --> 3922.12]  Oh, okay.
[3922.12 --> 3924.92]  So you're thinking like I want it to actually be good.
[3925.40 --> 3925.68]  Okay.
[3925.78 --> 3934.66]  There's this problem you have of like collapsible, like there's a standard UI paradigm of like I have a list of things, but each thing could be like expanded.
[3934.66 --> 3937.26]  And then there's like a sub part and that part could be expanded.
[3937.46 --> 3940.10]  Like so a tree view, basically, we would call it typically.
[3940.54 --> 3940.64]  Yeah.
[3942.04 --> 3949.70]  And there's this interesting problem of like how do you structure a library such that you can have a tree view of like 100 billion items if you wanted.
[3950.84 --> 3951.24]  Right?
[3951.24 --> 3955.54]  And have it be instant, still 60 frames a second or, you know, 240 frames a second or whatever your Monterey.
[3955.62 --> 3959.04]  So instant, many billions in a tree view.
[3959.48 --> 3960.18]  How do you do it?
[3960.36 --> 3960.54]  Right?
[3961.36 --> 3964.22]  And this is a problem that like most programmers would struggle with.
[3964.30 --> 3966.70]  It's very hard to know how to do that correctly.
[3966.84 --> 3970.80]  You obviously can't create an object for each one of those or anything like that.
[3970.86 --> 3971.84]  Like that's not going to fly.
[3972.32 --> 3973.38]  So how do you do it?
[3973.92 --> 3974.24]  Idiot.
[3974.24 --> 3975.34]  Don't show all billion.
[3975.98 --> 3977.36]  Don't show all billion, man.
[3977.60 --> 3978.54]  But how do you even know?
[3978.74 --> 3978.76]  Just paginate.
[3978.98 --> 3980.22]  How do you show the scroll bar?
[3980.66 --> 3980.80]  Right?
[3980.80 --> 3982.16]  How do you show the scroll bar at the correct?
[3982.24 --> 3983.86]  Like how do you know how big the whole thing will be?
[3984.30 --> 3986.52]  Because you have like parts that are expanded and parts that are not.
[3986.70 --> 3987.78]  There's all this interesting to it.
[3987.90 --> 3989.44]  And he breaks it down like just perfectly.
[3989.54 --> 3990.62]  He's like, look, here's how you do it.
[3990.76 --> 3991.46]  Exceptualize it this way.
[3991.50 --> 3992.32]  You do this, this, and this.
[3992.38 --> 3992.90]  And then it's easy.
[3993.12 --> 3993.28]  Right?
[3993.38 --> 3996.84]  And it's like and this is why I said like he's just a fantastic architect.
[3997.16 --> 4001.48]  And so like when he studies a problem, what you get out the other end is the problem is solved.
[4001.96 --> 4003.76]  And most architects, that's not what happens.
[4003.84 --> 4005.56]  Most architects, you give them a problem.
[4005.78 --> 4008.02]  They create an architecture which doesn't solve the problem.
[4008.02 --> 4014.82]  And then there's just this gigantic ugly architecture in your way while you're trying to do the thing that it supposedly solves.
[4014.88 --> 4015.72]  Like that's a good way.
[4015.78 --> 4017.56]  That's how I would describe React, for example.
[4017.68 --> 4017.84]  Right?
[4017.84 --> 4028.96]  So effectively, like what I really love about like his talk is he's talking about architecture that actually solves the problem instead of creating more problems for the people who use it.
[4029.34 --> 4031.90]  And so I would highly recommend checking that talk out.
[4032.56 --> 4034.30]  There's tons of great talks at BSC.
[4034.30 --> 4042.24]  So, you know, there's if you're interested in other stuff, I'd also say Dennis Gustafson's talk on paralyzing the physics solver.
[4042.56 --> 4049.64]  Anyone who likes multithreaded just wants just a glimpse into how multithreaded, like thinking about multithreaded.
[4049.86 --> 4055.32]  His talk shows just a really good intro of like here's how my stuff was doing.
[4055.32 --> 4062.18]  And I visualized it and I had to do these steps to like get rid of all the empty space that like all my threads were waiting on.
[4062.18 --> 4072.54]  And I feel like if you if you're unfamiliar with multithreaded programming, you don't have a lot of experience with how you would like look at something and optimize something so that it's actually running well in multithreaded.
[4072.70 --> 4077.16]  His talk would be a great intro because he he he displays it all.
[4077.42 --> 4080.68]  So you don't have to have a ton of experience to know what he's talking about.
[4080.72 --> 4082.06]  He displays it all visually.
[4082.06 --> 4083.96]  So you get you'll get a little intuition.
[4084.32 --> 4090.70]  You probably it's not like intro in the sense that he's going to tell you like all of the primitives and all that stuff.
[4090.70 --> 4094.32]  So it's still, you know, it's not like an intro talk in that sense.
[4094.32 --> 4102.14]  But I do think it's it would be a great intro to people to understand this is what's going on and then they can go do some of the learning on their own.
[4102.30 --> 4106.40]  So what you're trying to tell me is that all the talks were pretty amazing at Better Software Conference.
[4106.96 --> 4110.26]  I mean, they're not all out yet and I didn't see all of them.
[4110.26 --> 4112.18]  So I can't make a blanket statement.
[4112.36 --> 4120.08]  But what I will say is like the hit rate for talks you should watch at BSC is like astronomical compared to any other conference that I've ever seen.
[4120.68 --> 4121.08]  Yeah.
[4121.14 --> 4124.10]  Wait till you see our Arch Linux conference 2026.
[4124.52 --> 4126.80]  You're not even going to be ready for Casey.
[4127.26 --> 4127.36]  Yeah.
[4127.46 --> 4129.90]  Neither is Arch Linux because it probably won't be booting at the time.
[4129.90 --> 4138.52]  So you'll have to spend like the first three hours of the conference getting Arch back and running because like somebody forgot like how they had configured it on that and the laptop wasn't right and whatever.
[4138.68 --> 4146.22]  Hey, I'm streaming on Arch Linux right now and I only had to switch to a different camera because random lines appeared on my other camera.
[4146.58 --> 4148.90]  And I spent 30 minutes trying to debug it today.
[4149.00 --> 4150.10]  So but it still works.
[4150.20 --> 4151.42]  So it can work.
[4151.78 --> 4155.86]  Maybe I stream from Windows at Arch Linux Con, but it doesn't matter.
[4155.86 --> 4162.38]  I will say Linux bros out there.
[4163.16 --> 4168.86]  The March freaking continues, though, because now my main music workstation downstairs.
[4170.58 --> 4171.24]  It's Linux now.
[4171.90 --> 4175.92]  Slowly but surely, I am taking machines and we are moving to Linux.
[4176.38 --> 4178.12]  I don't know that I'm ever going to go Arch.
[4178.24 --> 4180.78]  Like, I don't know that I'm going to be a guy who's like, I run Arch, by the way.
[4181.02 --> 4181.36]  Hey, baby.
[4181.80 --> 4182.80]  I already know what you're going to do.
[4182.88 --> 4184.08]  Casey, I already know what he's going to do.
[4184.20 --> 4184.54]  Everyone.
[4184.54 --> 4186.44]  I'm not going to do Arch and he's going to come back.
[4186.58 --> 4188.52]  One stand up like, hey, guess what I did last night?
[4188.72 --> 4189.66]  I'm on Gen 2.
[4189.94 --> 4191.72]  Way faster than your little Arch system.
[4191.74 --> 4192.50]  It only took a little.
[4192.50 --> 4192.68]  I don't know.
[4192.78 --> 4193.26]  I don't know.
[4193.34 --> 4195.70]  I'm not Linux enough to make those kind of assertions.
[4196.04 --> 4196.18]  Okay.
[4196.18 --> 4199.04]  But think about being invited to the Arch Conf.
[4199.84 --> 4202.74]  You know, if you go to Arch, I mean, you could be on Arch Conf.
[4203.20 --> 4204.14]  What would I do to stand up?
[4204.26 --> 4205.62]  Is it like an AA meeting?
[4205.78 --> 4208.02]  You stand up and go like, I'm an Arch user.
[4208.12 --> 4209.68]  And everyone's like, thank you for sharing that.
[4210.04 --> 4210.90]  We were.
[4211.02 --> 4212.28]  We have been looking at.
[4212.32 --> 4213.26]  These are all previews.
[4213.26 --> 4217.34]  We have been looking at hiring a gospel choir for some evangelizing.
[4217.50 --> 4218.74]  I'm not joking.
[4218.96 --> 4220.16]  This is trying to find.
[4220.16 --> 4220.74]  That's going to happen.
[4221.34 --> 4221.82]  Wait, I'm sorry.
[4221.96 --> 4223.02]  Did you just say you're not joking?
[4223.08 --> 4223.78]  I thought you were joking.
[4223.96 --> 4224.42]  No, no, no.
[4224.42 --> 4224.78]  That's real.
[4225.38 --> 4225.58]  Oh, my God.
[4225.58 --> 4226.14]  That's real.
[4226.54 --> 4226.76]  Okay.
[4226.86 --> 4228.52]  So there might be some evangelizing.
[4228.70 --> 4228.94]  Okay.
[4228.96 --> 4229.62]  Because I got to be honest.
[4229.62 --> 4231.24]  You go to a conference sometimes and you hear about something.
[4231.30 --> 4231.78]  You're like, okay.
[4231.78 --> 4232.54]  They're kind of excited.
[4232.54 --> 4236.00]  I want to hear someone who really cares.
[4236.14 --> 4236.90]  Someone who's passionate.
[4237.06 --> 4238.32]  Imagine being the person in that choir and they got hired.
[4238.46 --> 4240.02]  They'd be like, where am I?
[4240.02 --> 4243.58]  I just want them to say Nyx in a Gregorian chant over and over again.
[4243.96 --> 4244.16]  Yes.
[4244.16 --> 4249.58]  That reminds me of that Infogrames corporate jingle that they have.
[4249.84 --> 4251.94]  Do you remember before they became Atari again?
[4252.06 --> 4252.96]  Remember Infogrames?
[4253.16 --> 4253.32]  Anyone?
[4254.00 --> 4254.32]  No.
[4255.20 --> 4255.56]  Seriously?
[4256.46 --> 4258.00]  Is it from the Borland Corporation?
[4258.44 --> 4258.60]  Yeah.
[4258.64 --> 4259.04]  Is it Borland?
[4259.24 --> 4260.00]  Is that a Borland product?
[4260.64 --> 4262.46]  Are we allowed to play this on the standup?
[4262.50 --> 4263.32]  I don't actually know.
[4263.96 --> 4264.48]  I don't know.
[4265.46 --> 4265.86]  Okay.
[4265.98 --> 4268.06]  Hold on one second because I feel like this is important.
[4268.52 --> 4268.82]  Okay.
[4268.84 --> 4271.48]  We can always delete it afterwards if it gets us.
[4271.48 --> 4275.84]  If we get in trouble here, we can leak more things for the Arch Linux conference.
[4276.30 --> 4280.68]  The other thing, people, start practicing because we are going to have some speed running
[4280.68 --> 4281.60]  competitions there.
[4281.60 --> 4287.88]  So, basic categories, which is going to be Arch install, no Arch wiki, any percent.
[4288.62 --> 4291.64]  So, you got to get it booted, but no Arch wiki.
[4291.78 --> 4292.00]  Okay?
[4292.08 --> 4293.02]  Going to put you up there.
[4293.82 --> 4294.32]  All right.
[4294.42 --> 4297.96]  Well, hey, this was actually a very illuminating standup, Casey.
[4298.20 --> 4299.12]  Thank you very much for that.
[4299.20 --> 4303.48]  And now I'm more eager than ever to have an eight to ten hour react video on my channel.
[4304.76 --> 4306.86]  Prime, the people demand it.
[4307.20 --> 4308.22]  They demand it.
[4308.26 --> 4309.98]  And you must give them what they want.
[4309.98 --> 4313.20]  Well, I first have to ask Better Software Conference if I can do that.
[4313.56 --> 4316.86]  You know, conferences tend to be a bit more shy about yes or no to those kind of things.
[4317.62 --> 4318.96]  They will give you the yes.
[4319.84 --> 4322.14]  I guarantee you they will give you the yes.
[4322.20 --> 4323.38]  He's the creator of the talk.
[4323.46 --> 4324.26]  He's allowed the demand.
[4324.38 --> 4327.12]  And remember, Prime, as long as you, like you're saying, if it's eight hours, you just
[4327.12 --> 4328.20]  got to, it's got to be transformative.
[4328.44 --> 4329.56]  So, it can't be five hours.
[4330.16 --> 4331.74]  Two hours extra of commentary.
[4331.92 --> 4333.56]  We need a good eight.
[4333.78 --> 4334.56]  That's transformative.
[4334.56 --> 4339.32]  Also, guys, the longer we talk and we can keep distracting, trash is to pee so bad.
[4339.52 --> 4341.86]  We can extend this for another hour.
[4342.00 --> 4342.60]  My legs are like this.
[4343.46 --> 4344.88]  Guys, we can get him to piss his pants.
[4345.10 --> 4346.04]  If we just keep a little.
[4346.04 --> 4348.02]  No, just pee back into that bottle that you have.
[4348.08 --> 4349.82]  If you're done drinking, just pee back into the bottle.
[4349.84 --> 4352.88]  Dude, I finished this bottle like ten minutes until the podcast.
[4353.06 --> 4353.62]  Pee that out.
[4353.80 --> 4354.58]  Just pee it back in there.
[4354.62 --> 4355.84]  It's already colored yellow.
[4355.94 --> 4357.52]  It's a yellow bottle to begin with.
[4357.92 --> 4359.20]  I thought that was a vape.
[4359.84 --> 4360.26]  All right.
[4360.32 --> 4361.50]  We have to end this.
[4361.56 --> 4362.86]  This is getting ridiculous now.
[4362.86 --> 4364.58]  Yeah, we also need Teej to end it.
[4364.64 --> 4365.20]  Where's Teej?
[4365.42 --> 4366.28]  That's a good point.
[4366.38 --> 4366.62]  Wait, wait.
[4366.62 --> 4367.32]  Teej, are you out there?
[4367.48 --> 4368.16]  Can you end it?
[4368.44 --> 4369.62]  Wait, Teej can't end it?
[4369.74 --> 4370.38]  Oh, snap.
[4370.44 --> 4370.90]  We're stuck?
[4371.36 --> 4371.80]  Oh, man.
[4371.80 --> 4373.68]  We might be stuck recording this podcast forever.
[4373.74 --> 4374.58]  This is a disaster.
