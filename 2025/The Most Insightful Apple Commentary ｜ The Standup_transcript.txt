[0.00 --> 2.44]  So, I guess, so that's it.
[2.60 --> 4.00]  It was nice chatting with you guys.
[4.08 --> 8.66]  I'm going to head out because I think you guys said you were talking about Apple or something,
[8.74 --> 9.76]  which I know nothing about.
[9.88 --> 10.62]  So, I think we're good.
[11.64 --> 12.90]  You guys got it from here.
[13.52 --> 15.22]  And I'm going to watch the show.
[15.28 --> 15.88]  I'm going to love it.
[15.96 --> 17.84]  And I'm really looking forward to what you guys are going to say.
[20.24 --> 21.84]  And that's the intro to the start of...
[22.36 --> 26.06]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26.48 --> 27.28]  Anyway, sorry.
[27.34 --> 28.92]  Today with me, we have Casey.
[28.92 --> 31.66]  We have Trash Dev and we have TJ.
[31.84 --> 34.30]  We're going to be talking about Apple and their release.
[34.44 --> 35.90]  Yes, I actually watched the video.
[36.32 --> 37.22]  And I'm not going to lie to you guys.
[37.24 --> 37.90]  I watched the video.
[38.28 --> 39.72]  I am not an Apple person.
[39.82 --> 41.06]  I've never owned an Apple phone.
[41.68 --> 44.40]  I owned an Apple computer maybe eight, ten years ago.
[44.72 --> 46.66]  I mean, I've been not in this whole Apple world.
[47.18 --> 52.62]  But, dude, after watching an hour of marketing, I'm like, dude, I could own Apple.
[53.30 --> 54.16]  Like, look at that.
[54.32 --> 55.94]  Look how thin that phone is.
[56.00 --> 57.26]  I think I need a thin phone.
[57.26 --> 60.28]  And I realize that I'm getting one-shotted by advertisement.
[60.48 --> 62.82]  I haven't been on advertisement in so long.
[63.36 --> 65.06]  I just get sucked right in.
[65.56 --> 70.18]  I'm looking forward to a Prime Apple arc if that's a thing that's going to happen in the world.
[70.32 --> 71.58]  DHH will cancel us, Prime.
[71.64 --> 72.10]  Don't do it.
[72.26 --> 74.26]  Do you realize how obnoxious I already am?
[74.70 --> 76.90]  Do you really want me to be on Apple?
[76.90 --> 78.80]  Am I the only one that uses Apple?
[79.52 --> 79.92]  Yes.
[81.60 --> 83.06]  That's why we have you on here.
[83.36 --> 85.38]  I mean, I only use Apple because WorkPace was a computer.
[85.50 --> 85.84]  I would never.
[86.34 --> 87.02]  Wait, that's a lie.
[87.10 --> 87.40]  I'm lying.
[87.72 --> 88.48]  Yeah, you are lying.
[88.50 --> 89.16]  I have my own computer.
[89.38 --> 90.46]  I have my own personal computer.
[90.62 --> 91.10]  Okay, I lied.
[91.46 --> 93.30]  Trash tries to do the, like, it's my works fault.
[93.32 --> 95.24]  I'm not an Apple shill by any means.
[95.34 --> 97.48]  Show me your phone, Trash.
[97.80 --> 99.22]  Well, I got an iPhone.
[100.38 --> 100.74]  Okay.
[101.48 --> 102.50]  What was that on your wrist?
[102.50 --> 104.46]  Oh, no.
[104.60 --> 106.86]  I got an Apple.
[107.44 --> 108.32]  Oh, no.
[108.80 --> 109.86]  Oh, I got an Apple.
[110.82 --> 113.56]  Oh, no.
[113.56 --> 114.22]  What are the headphones?
[114.54 --> 115.16]  What are the headphones?
[115.52 --> 116.92]  Oh, my God, dude.
[117.32 --> 118.90]  I'm an Apple shill.
[119.16 --> 120.12]  Oh, no.
[120.86 --> 124.96]  Honestly, I didn't even, like, view myself as that until I looked around and, oh, man.
[125.54 --> 126.86]  Tim has cooked me.
[127.02 --> 128.70]  Prime, you thought you got one shot.
[128.80 --> 132.20]  Trash is already $5,000 deep, dude.
[132.50 --> 133.22]  Yeah, yeah.
[133.38 --> 137.12]  Can we get Apple shill under that, under that trash name there?
[137.12 --> 137.54]  We can fix that.
[137.54 --> 138.60]  I don't think Tess is.
[138.62 --> 141.32]  And I use a magic mouse, too, unironically.
[141.32 --> 141.46]  What the?
[141.64 --> 143.38]  Nobody uses a magic mouse in the world.
[143.38 --> 144.28]  I'm the only one.
[144.48 --> 147.44]  Not even Tim's the only one left you probably have.
[147.44 --> 148.08]  I love it.
[148.20 --> 149.12]  So, here, these are my.
[149.16 --> 150.94]  Remember, he scrolls it like a phone.
[151.60 --> 153.40]  He picks it up and uses his thumb.
[153.74 --> 156.06]  Like, he's, like, scrolling on the internet.
[156.82 --> 157.30]  Hey, man.
[157.76 --> 158.12]  Trash.
[158.22 --> 158.64]  Now, be honest with us.
[158.64 --> 159.10]  Computer.
[159.52 --> 160.56]  I can't believe I own this many things.
[160.56 --> 161.70]  Computer, please.
[161.90 --> 162.72]  I can't believe it.
[162.72 --> 162.88]  Computer.
[162.88 --> 163.92]  I'm actually ashamed right now.
[163.98 --> 164.54]  I am ashamed.
[164.64 --> 164.94]  I'm so sorry.
[164.94 --> 165.22]  Trash.
[165.56 --> 166.58]  The people need to know.
[168.00 --> 171.86]  This will seriously be the last straw if I find this out.
[172.28 --> 174.96]  Please don't tell me that you use Siri unironically.
[177.36 --> 180.16]  When I'm driving Apple CarPlay, I'll say, hey.
[180.16 --> 180.72]  That's different.
[180.94 --> 182.20]  Hands-free in the car is different.
[182.42 --> 183.02]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[183.12 --> 184.14]  I do it for hands-free stuff.
[184.14 --> 186.90]  I don't really do anything else other than that.
[187.10 --> 187.24]  See?
[187.36 --> 187.86]  That was close.
[188.14 --> 189.18]  I'm a safe driver.
[189.68 --> 190.68]  So, there you go.
[190.88 --> 191.02]  Okay?
[191.36 --> 192.34]  I don't use Apple Intelligence.
[192.56 --> 193.96]  I don't even know what Apple Intelligence is.
[194.18 --> 194.80]  Nude as Apple.
[195.32 --> 196.72]  You're probably using it, Trash.
[197.28 --> 198.08]  I don't think so.
[198.08 --> 198.94]  I don't think I nibbled it.
[198.96 --> 200.42]  If I am, it's not doing anything.
[201.50 --> 203.44]  I think that's what they call Apple Intelligence.
[203.72 --> 204.32]  Okay, okay.
[204.46 --> 205.32]  Roughly, you got it.
[205.72 --> 206.98]  Okay, got it, got it, got it.
[207.14 --> 210.30]  So, yeah, I guess I use Apple.
[210.58 --> 210.88]  I don't know.
[210.88 --> 212.88]  This is a great revelation.
[213.12 --> 213.86]  This episode's already working.
[213.86 --> 215.00]  I forgot about Apple Watch.
[215.04 --> 215.62]  That's crazy.
[215.98 --> 216.56]  That's crazy.
[217.74 --> 219.44]  All right, and now we're done.
[219.56 --> 220.92]  Okay, that was the end right there.
[221.52 --> 221.96]  Honestly, that's all we need.
[221.96 --> 223.78]  Thanks for joining us on the stand-up, everyone.
[223.90 --> 225.06]  You've been a great audience.
[225.36 --> 229.34]  Trash, to be honest, though, are you going to buy the little strap for your iPhone?
[229.70 --> 234.04]  Whether you're a Vibe coder or a handcrafted free-range NeoVim user,
[234.04 --> 238.94]  you still need CI to be able to build your binaries, run your tests, or make your releases.
[239.34 --> 240.94]  That's where Blacksmith comes in.
[241.04 --> 245.72]  It takes your GitHub actions, and with a one-line change, makes them faster and more cost-effective.
[245.94 --> 251.06]  Not only that, but you can finally get visibility into your CI pipeline right when things go wrong.
[251.16 --> 254.28]  We're happy to have them as our sponsor for this episode, because just like us,
[254.40 --> 256.08]  this one is truly a no-brainer.
[256.28 --> 259.76]  Sign up and enjoy faster GitHub action workflows at a much lower price.
[259.88 --> 263.12]  Blacksmith, twice the speed and up to 75% reduction in costs.
[263.12 --> 264.90]  Check them out at blacksmith.sh.
[265.30 --> 267.04]  Now back to the stand-up.
[267.04 --> 269.38]  I don't think that people know what they're talking about.
[269.46 --> 270.12]  Hold on, hold on.
[270.12 --> 272.04]  Yeah, you're getting too deep now.
[272.70 --> 276.18]  Especially for people like me who did not watch whatever this is supposed to be.
[276.18 --> 281.12]  For those that are wondering, this is what they're unironically proposing everybody should wear.
[281.30 --> 286.52]  They're like, and with your new iPhone 17 Pro, you can get the iPhone 17 Pro strap.
[286.86 --> 289.56]  The strap-on Pro 17, or whatever they're calling it.
[289.72 --> 292.28]  Strap-on Pro would be a great name for it.
[292.42 --> 293.42]  I think you've nailed it.
[293.42 --> 296.20]  Wait, Brian, is that what got you interested in Apple?
[296.38 --> 297.92]  I'm going to buy the strap-on Pro.
[298.08 --> 298.96]  Look at this thing.
[299.88 --> 300.68]  I know.
[300.90 --> 302.88]  Just leave the strap-on off for a second here.
[303.26 --> 304.12]  But look at this guy.
[304.42 --> 309.82]  He's going for a bike ride while wearing a European man satchel, except for the European man satchel is just a phone.
[310.12 --> 311.68]  Like, who's actually going to wear this?
[312.22 --> 316.20]  Okay, so this is where I think Apple dropped the ball.
[316.44 --> 317.86]  Not because they made the satchel.
[318.00 --> 323.58]  Obviously, the satchel is great because they can charge a lot more money than it costs to make the shoelace to put that on.
[325.24 --> 331.58]  But what they're missing, clearly, is now everybody's going to have their iPhone out on display.
[332.48 --> 333.42]  So this is a statement.
[333.58 --> 335.90]  It's not really about the convenience of having it in your phone or not.
[335.90 --> 339.62]  It's really just about showing that you bought the latest Pro.
[339.88 --> 340.28]  You know what I'm saying?
[340.32 --> 341.22]  You're like, oh, my goodness.
[341.86 --> 342.56]  That guy's loaded.
[342.86 --> 342.96]  Right?
[343.32 --> 345.08]  It's like you're flexing the watch.
[345.16 --> 355.06]  You've got to flex the – Apple needs to be doing something like they sell only a special case if you spent $25,000 on your Apple account.
[355.06 --> 355.76]  Oh, my gosh.
[355.86 --> 357.62]  Like the Air One approach.
[358.02 --> 358.20]  Yes.
[358.24 --> 358.38]  Right?
[358.50 --> 362.34]  Like I own bananas, but they have an Air One sticker on them.
[362.44 --> 363.62]  It's just like, oh, I have Apple.
[363.62 --> 365.34]  But this is the special Apple.
[365.34 --> 372.98]  Tim Cook, if you need me to help you with monetization here, you guys could be selling $1,000 cases to the Apple whales.
[373.14 --> 374.46]  Trash would accidentally buy one.
[374.78 --> 375.88]  Like he just wouldn't even notice.
[375.98 --> 378.32]  He'd be like, well, you've got to get one when you check out.
[378.40 --> 379.78]  It's available only to me.
[379.86 --> 381.18]  I'm not shilling or anything.
[381.54 --> 383.56]  I need an intervention.
[383.84 --> 384.24]  Wait, wait, wait.
[384.26 --> 385.72]  Do you guys use Androids?
[385.86 --> 387.08]  What are you using?
[387.38 --> 388.92]  Yes, the other phone.
[389.12 --> 390.02]  We do use Androids.
[390.32 --> 392.12]  Or like a Google Pixel, right?
[392.50 --> 392.64]  Yeah.
[392.64 --> 393.90]  I mean, Pixel runs Androids.
[394.14 --> 394.66]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[394.66 --> 395.68]  I got a Pixel as well.
[396.06 --> 396.18]  Yeah.
[396.68 --> 398.06]  Is anyone on graphene?
[398.22 --> 398.92]  You're so bad.
[399.74 --> 400.64]  I don't know what I'm on.
[400.68 --> 403.20]  I'm on random piece of crap that Google ships.
[403.42 --> 405.86]  It's, and it's, I mean, the operating system.
[405.98 --> 408.34]  The phone is actually, mine's a Motorola, I think.
[409.10 --> 409.46]  Nice.
[410.66 --> 412.60]  But don't you guys think that would be a good strategy for them?
[412.60 --> 416.38]  I feel like they're leaving a lot of money on the table for Apple users.
[417.38 --> 418.86]  Well, here's the thing.
[418.92 --> 423.72]  You said that they dropped the ball, but they clearly didn't drop anything because they've
[423.72 --> 425.46]  got it attached to a little string around their neck.
[425.46 --> 426.02]  Great point.
[426.02 --> 429.00]  So the ball is, the ball is hanging from Tim Cook's neck.
[429.00 --> 429.28]  It's still in play.
[429.52 --> 429.70]  Yeah.
[429.76 --> 430.52]  It's still in play.
[430.52 --> 431.92]  Potential energy is what they call it.
[431.92 --> 435.02]  It's dangling near Tim Cook's waist is where the ball is.
[435.18 --> 436.92]  And he just has to reach down and grab it.
[436.92 --> 445.56]  I would love to see Tim Cook wearing this satchel because there's no sales plummet after
[445.56 --> 446.74]  Tim Cook puts it on.
[446.86 --> 447.44]  You know what I'm saying?
[448.52 --> 449.64]  Here's what I will say.
[449.78 --> 454.84]  Knowing nothing about any of this, and I would have liked it to remain that way, but unfortunately
[454.84 --> 462.80]  I'm doing this podcast, is that if this is, of all the things, even the Vision Pro, of
[462.80 --> 469.08]  all the things I've seen Apple do since Steve Jobs died, this is the one where I think he
[469.08 --> 471.54]  would have fired the entire company if he was still here.
[471.80 --> 478.90]  He would have been like, I worked so hard and so long to force everyone to make computing
[478.90 --> 484.08]  actually be cool, and you guys turned it into a freaking man bag?
[484.20 --> 486.06]  Are you out of your goddamn mind?
[486.98 --> 490.16]  He would have thrown something across the room.
[490.16 --> 494.46]  He would have thrown the iPhone attached to it, so he would have swung it like a bola
[494.46 --> 498.08]  and then released it at somebody and it would have hit them in the head.
[498.14 --> 499.74]  And he would have been like, you're all fired.
[500.06 --> 503.60]  Get me someone who knows how to not look a complete idiot in public.
[504.08 --> 505.66]  Is that the David and Goliath weapon?
[505.96 --> 506.24]  Yeah.
[506.44 --> 506.88]  The bola thing?
[506.90 --> 509.82]  I heard that the satchel was getting regulated in the UK.
[509.94 --> 511.38]  You do have to register your satchel.
[511.38 --> 521.18]  But I mean, to be fair, Apple did release the Vision Pro, and how many thousands of people
[521.18 --> 526.96]  walked around, even in the streets, with their Vision Pro on, unironically, like walking around.
[527.62 --> 531.70]  So the amount of people doing European man satchels, registered European man satchels,
[531.80 --> 532.98]  will be through the roof.
[533.12 --> 535.72]  Like there's going to be so many people walking around with it.
[536.18 --> 538.06]  Catch me on the next podcast with a satchel.
[538.06 --> 539.40]  It's just like a segue.
[539.60 --> 541.28]  Of course people will do it.
[541.60 --> 545.52]  But the brilliance of Steve Jobs was like, he did things, he made computing into something
[545.52 --> 547.26]  that everyone thought was cool.
[547.70 --> 550.02]  No one's going to think this is cool mass market.
[550.24 --> 551.54]  Like that's just not going to happen.
[551.88 --> 552.76]  Gen Z, dude.
[553.10 --> 553.74]  100%.
[553.74 --> 555.50]  I think, Casey, that's what I'm going to disagree.
[555.72 --> 557.98]  I'm pretty sure we'll have to revisit in six months.
[558.34 --> 558.48]  Yeah.
[558.48 --> 562.72]  But this is just like, people already do the fanny pack just to carry around their phone.
[563.10 --> 565.74]  This is like fanny pack, but actually for your phone.
[565.74 --> 568.96]  But you don't get anything, you don't get the bonuses of a fanny pack, right?
[569.20 --> 569.92]  But people don't.
[569.92 --> 571.94]  You can also put some chapstick in the fanny pack.
[572.18 --> 572.74]  No, they don't.
[572.90 --> 573.82]  Put their credit cards.
[574.40 --> 576.20]  The credit cards goes on the phone case on the back.
[576.30 --> 579.54]  Fanny pack is like 1% of all phone users.
[579.90 --> 581.38]  It's not 50%.
[581.38 --> 582.56]  Like it is not cool.
[582.74 --> 582.88]  Okay.
[582.94 --> 585.26]  Nobody is racing to put their phone in a fanny pack.
[585.36 --> 586.58]  That's the minority of people.
[586.96 --> 590.78]  Of course, a very small number of people will do this satchel and everyone else will be
[590.78 --> 591.36]  like, hmm.
[591.36 --> 595.26]  And it's a mark against Apple's mindshare, just like the Vision Pro was.
[595.98 --> 596.10]  Yeah.
[596.20 --> 599.82]  I thought you were saying popular in the sense not necessarily, because like Apple's not
[599.82 --> 602.92]  popular in the sense of like total number of people who have iPhones, right?
[602.94 --> 603.66]  Like in the world.
[604.20 --> 605.26]  In America, they are.
[605.58 --> 605.78]  Yeah.
[605.90 --> 606.24]  In America.
[606.24 --> 612.78]  In fact, among people who are paying to be cool, they are the premium brand everywhere
[612.78 --> 613.26]  in the world.
[613.58 --> 614.48]  But that's what I'm saying.
[614.62 --> 618.68]  I'm saying I was, I thought you meant like it will be popular, like it won't be popular
[618.68 --> 620.24]  in the sense of like stylish.
[620.24 --> 624.64]  Like I think it will be the trend to do it, even if a lot of people aren't doing it.
[625.12 --> 625.48]  Really?
[625.62 --> 626.26]  I think you're wrong.
[626.42 --> 627.16]  Wait, what does that mean?
[627.16 --> 630.94]  I think, I think literally four days into this, someone's going to throw on their satchel,
[631.06 --> 633.44]  walk out into SF and be brutally robbed.
[633.80 --> 636.76]  It's going to happen hundreds of times due to how dangerous that place is.
[636.76 --> 639.70]  That has literally not stopped them at all from anything.
[639.92 --> 641.82]  Why do you think they're going to change their mind about that now?
[642.02 --> 644.40]  Because now it's just, it's so out there.
[644.40 --> 646.72]  Like you don't like just walk around with your money hanging out.
[647.08 --> 648.68]  This one is your iPhone and it's a bear.
[648.68 --> 649.82]  I've seen San Alman's car.
[649.82 --> 650.78]  I need clarification.
[651.60 --> 653.24]  What's brutally robbed versus robbed?
[653.66 --> 656.82]  Robbed is where like someone holds up like maybe a gun to you and you like raise your
[656.82 --> 658.42]  hands and you sweat and you like throw your wallet.
[658.78 --> 662.46]  Brutely robbed is like where you get pistol whipped and like beat up and your stuff taken
[662.46 --> 663.08]  from you, right?
[663.46 --> 663.80]  Okay.
[664.58 --> 665.62]  Okay, I got the visual.
[665.92 --> 666.04]  Okay.
[666.14 --> 666.56]  That's pretty bad.
[666.76 --> 667.64]  Okay, got it, got it, got it.
[667.76 --> 668.72]  One involves battery.
[669.32 --> 672.22]  Well, there could, it could be worse than what, even what you're thinking, Prime.
[673.06 --> 678.28]  It could be that someone goes to rob you and then just sees what you're wearing and just laughs.
[678.62 --> 681.06]  You get humiliated by the robber.
[681.22 --> 682.98]  There's going to be so many memes of that online.
[682.98 --> 687.20]  The robber thinks you're such a dork that they can't even quite pull off the robber.
[687.22 --> 688.84]  It's like our new anti-theft device.
[689.24 --> 695.48]  Everyone will just start laughing at you so hard that they won't be able to complete the robbery of your phone.
[696.72 --> 697.10]  I don't know.
[697.22 --> 699.56]  When I think about that satchel, I think about San Francisco.
[699.80 --> 701.72]  So I think it's going to pop off there for sure.
[702.24 --> 702.72]  And LA.
[703.34 --> 703.96]  And LA.
[704.66 --> 706.62]  We'll set a reminder right now for six months.
[706.78 --> 710.26]  I'm going to make a calendar event for six months from now and we'll revisit.
[710.44 --> 713.78]  I'm going to go to a tech conference in SF and everyone's going to be wearing that satchel.
[713.96 --> 714.70]  I swear.
[715.22 --> 717.66]  I need you to actually go to a tech meetup in SF.
[718.44 --> 719.18]  Should I bring my satchel?
[719.18 --> 721.70]  In three weeks from now, I need you to go get a satchel.
[723.00 --> 724.20]  Then I want you to report back.
[724.38 --> 727.18]  If you wear a satchel, do other satchelers come up to you?
[728.76 --> 730.48]  You're now in this cool kid club.
[730.48 --> 733.76]  And so they're all going to stay in the corner by myself with my satchel.
[733.88 --> 736.80]  I set a calendar event for myself a few months from now.
[736.94 --> 738.32]  Is Apple satchel popular?
[738.52 --> 739.36]  We'll check back in.
[739.46 --> 742.30]  We'll report to everybody on the pod.
[742.30 --> 742.70]  We'll see.
[742.70 --> 743.56]  I hope their satchels can't get cut easily.
[743.66 --> 747.12]  People are just going to walk around with scissors and just like pull your satchel off.
[747.50 --> 747.64]  Dang.
[747.82 --> 748.28]  You know what I'm saying?
[749.04 --> 749.82]  Doing you a favor.
[750.60 --> 750.80]  Yeah.
[750.82 --> 751.26]  It's true.
[751.58 --> 751.88]  It's true.
[752.16 --> 755.34]  They're making you cooler by quickly applying a pair of scissors.
[755.34 --> 756.90]  You can't ask for more than that.
[757.30 --> 761.26]  Here's one cool thing that – well, I don't know, Prime, do you want to lead this?
[761.42 --> 763.08]  But I thought there was some pretty cool stuff.
[763.08 --> 764.14]  You're the Apple guy, Trash.
[764.14 --> 764.98]  Yeah, you're the Apple guy.
[765.02 --> 765.62]  Start shilling.
[765.94 --> 766.50]  Apple shill.
[766.62 --> 767.88]  I'm not an Apple shill.
[768.02 --> 768.12]  Okay.
[768.42 --> 769.46]  This is for my health.
[769.66 --> 769.82]  Okay.
[770.14 --> 770.50]  All right.
[770.56 --> 770.84]  All right.
[771.46 --> 772.16]  It's integrated.
[772.16 --> 774.98]  Anyways, the one thing I thought was super cool –
[774.98 --> 776.40]  He was about to do a sales pitch.
[776.72 --> 777.16]  I know.
[777.58 --> 778.78]  I'm holding myself back.
[778.96 --> 779.38]  I'm like, why?
[779.60 --> 781.46]  I think it's saved lives.
[781.74 --> 782.86]  I'm not an Apple shill.
[782.98 --> 785.40]  But did you know the integration across platforms?
[786.20 --> 788.58]  I used to be 300 pounds.
[788.72 --> 790.38]  Then I got the Apple Watch.
[790.52 --> 792.06]  Now I'm a jiu-jitsu champion.
[792.44 --> 795.20]  I'm not an Apple shill, but it changed my life.
[796.16 --> 798.40]  That was kind of where I was going, but I didn't.
[798.48 --> 798.70]  Okay.
[799.40 --> 800.84]  But you guys have to agree.
[800.84 --> 805.30]  So the AirPods, which I have right here, there's a new one coming out.
[805.38 --> 807.16]  They do the live translation.
[807.66 --> 811.86]  I don't know how good it's going to be, but like Casey, imagine you have these on.
[812.14 --> 813.06]  You go to Italy.
[813.24 --> 816.94]  You hear people speak in Italian or whatever, and it does the live translation for you.
[817.04 --> 818.50]  I think that's like the coolest thing ever.
[819.22 --> 821.78]  So that's like specifically one of the things that I'm like super cool.
[821.78 --> 822.28]  I actually did want to say something.
[822.28 --> 823.66]  Yeah, that's going to go great in France.
[824.22 --> 825.08]  They're going to love that.
[825.10 --> 827.52]  They're going to love that when the tourists come over there and are like,
[827.52 --> 829.92]  I speak fluent French thanks to my AirPods.
[829.92 --> 834.38]  Speaking of things that will get you humiliated and robbed in public, ladies and gentlemen,
[834.54 --> 835.22]  this is featured.
[835.54 --> 837.08]  Apple seems to be on a roll.
[837.18 --> 843.72]  They're like, let's see what are all the things we can do so that people literally hate the users of our products.
[843.78 --> 848.46]  It's like one, make them think they can speak a foreign language using something that probably won't work.
[848.46 --> 855.68]  Two, let's have everyone wear like a little dangly string thing around them so they look like a complete dork all the time.
[856.18 --> 857.02]  What's three?
[857.38 --> 860.94]  Is it like wear a hat beanie with a capella on top?
[861.18 --> 863.98]  Or what is the third product that they announced?
[863.98 --> 865.00]  Because I can't wait.
[865.88 --> 871.40]  Casey, the third thing is that now when you go to France, you'll hear how much they hate you instead of being blissfully unaware.
[871.40 --> 871.86]  That's the third part.
[873.08 --> 874.20]  That's the third part.
[874.58 --> 874.80]  Yes.
[874.98 --> 875.20]  All right.
[875.32 --> 877.26]  But I saw a couple things on that one.
[877.32 --> 884.86]  First, with the live translation, I really already hated so much when people do this move.
[885.94 --> 886.58]  What was that?
[886.84 --> 886.98]  Right?
[887.02 --> 888.24]  Like I hate that so much.
[888.24 --> 892.92]  And so now to be like people going, grabbing the grid, do double stems grab.
[893.08 --> 893.98]  Can you say that again?
[894.56 --> 897.84]  I'm already going to be driven mad enough by that.
[897.84 --> 902.56]  But on top of it, there's just no way.
[903.10 --> 906.36]  I've never met anybody on the internet that says translations are good.
[906.58 --> 910.42]  Every single time you've gone through any sort of translation service, people always complain about it.
[910.46 --> 916.78]  Any automated subtitles are always like, whoa, it's way off if you're doing these autos.
[916.78 --> 917.60]  You should turn these off.
[917.72 --> 922.62]  That's like number one comment on YouTube is turn off the auto translations because they're all so bad.
[923.36 --> 926.08]  And so it's like, okay, so how is this going to work in practice?
[926.08 --> 927.30]  Is it going to be even any good?
[927.30 --> 931.64]  And then I had one more item with the AirPods, but now I have seemed to forgot it.
[931.72 --> 933.08]  It was my favorite part about them all.
[933.42 --> 940.72]  There's an additional thing about the translation, which is, are we sure it's doing translation and not like, you know, old person translation?
[941.02 --> 945.90]  Like, is it possible that what these things are doing is you go like this and go like, where is the bathroom?
[945.90 --> 953.30]  And then it just plays your voice, but shouting like, where is the bathroom is what comes out of the thing.
[953.30 --> 958.14]  And so it's just like, it slows you down, slows down your cadence and increases your volume.
[958.48 --> 959.96]  Why are you guys yucking my yum, okay?
[959.96 --> 961.54]  You guys are all yucking my yum.
[962.38 --> 962.60]  Okay.
[962.70 --> 962.88]  Okay.
[962.88 --> 963.96]  I remember the other thing.
[964.18 --> 966.76]  There is, there's also this kind of like romantic funness.
[966.76 --> 976.24]  And this is definitely super, this is definitely Silicon Valley to a T where they just believe they're super well traveled and their life is like this traveling extravaganza.
[976.34 --> 977.28]  So they're like, you know what I need?
[977.32 --> 979.72]  I need to be able to just constantly be translating my head.
[979.76 --> 981.04]  So I'm like, what are you, Peter levels?
[981.04 --> 982.08]  Like nobody does this.
[982.08 --> 982.32]  Okay.
[982.32 --> 989.16]  Like the average person sits in their town 99.9% of the time and never interacts with anybody else that speaks different languages.
[989.32 --> 990.50]  I'm at least in America.
[990.68 --> 995.66]  I'm sure this might be a slight different in Europe, but this is, it's just like, I've never met anyone.
[995.66 --> 996.70]  That's just like, you know what I need?
[996.76 --> 998.70]  I need auto live translating all the time.
[998.80 --> 999.90]  Idea sounds super cool.
[1000.28 --> 1001.24]  Never needed it in practice.
[1001.24 --> 1007.06]  I specifically want just to hear people talk shit about me, but not actually interact.
[1007.16 --> 1011.74]  Like you just go to like your, your favorite, like restaurant that's off like Chinese or something.
[1011.74 --> 1013.00]  And you're just like, this fucking American.
[1015.42 --> 1017.24]  And I don't think, I don't know if it works that way.
[1017.28 --> 1017.90]  Cause I don't know.
[1018.16 --> 1019.20]  I hope it does out.
[1019.42 --> 1021.40]  So you won't actually hear who's talking.
[1021.40 --> 1024.22]  Cause it does noise canceling and like reduces their, their sound.
[1024.58 --> 1027.34]  It's probably gonna sound like ass when you're in a restaurant with all that noise too.
[1027.52 --> 1031.56]  If anything, if it actually does work, it's going to make me not want to go to those places anymore.
[1032.08 --> 1041.68]  So I do think it may be the thing you're talking about prime though, is at least it at least continues the idea of Apple.
[1041.74 --> 1047.34]  Sort of trying to position themselves as premium and expensive and for rich people or whatever.
[1047.34 --> 1047.70]  Right.
[1048.26 --> 1051.08]  Because it's like, Oh, I just go to so many countries.
[1051.24 --> 1054.56]  I can't possibly speak all these languages, but thankfully my air pot.
[1054.72 --> 1054.86]  Right.
[1054.86 --> 1066.48]  And so like, I'm assuming that the next feature, like there's probably going to be some feature that they roll out next time, which is something like, you know, it's getting hard to manage all three of your houses at the same time.
[1066.48 --> 1077.56]  So this new, like, you know, multi house feature that lets you manage your house in the Hamptons, as well as your house in rural Japan will help you stay on top of all the maintenance items.
[1077.56 --> 1077.84]  Right.
[1077.88 --> 1080.66]  So they, you know, they could be just going for that kind of thing.
[1080.66 --> 1082.96]  And, you know, this is appropriate there.
[1083.14 --> 1087.78]  This is why all the agentic demos of like, Oh, here's what our AI can do is like booking travel.
[1087.92 --> 1088.12]  Yeah.
[1088.18 --> 1089.76]  They're like, well, that's the only thing I do in my life.
[1089.76 --> 1090.68]  What else do you do?
[1090.76 --> 1091.72]  That's all I do.
[1092.18 --> 1097.66]  I just travel around and get people to give me money for hooking up this AI cloud to this website.
[1097.66 --> 1110.36]  Because it did feel like your, your idea of the old person translate thing though, or just yells at you would kind of actually be helpful because there's, I just feel like I run into so many people who are big time mumblers while I'm out and about.
[1110.48 --> 1112.26]  Like, I don't need audio canceling.
[1112.34 --> 1114.04]  I need it like audio boost, right?
[1114.04 --> 1116.38]  Where it says, it seems like that person you're talking to.
[1116.62 --> 1118.00]  And they're just talking like this all the time.
[1118.08 --> 1118.84]  I like, I need it.
[1118.88 --> 1122.58]  So when I go through Taco Bell, I can understand what they said in the drive-thru.
[1122.76 --> 1123.38]  You know what I mean?
[1123.50 --> 1125.56]  Like I have something like that, a previous release.
[1125.86 --> 1126.04]  Yeah.
[1126.04 --> 1126.80]  That's what I need.
[1126.80 --> 1127.86]  I need audio boost.
[1127.96 --> 1128.34]  You know what I'm saying?
[1128.34 --> 1131.64]  Like, no, I did not ask for no ground beef.
[1131.76 --> 1133.40]  I asked for extra ground beef when I get home.
[1133.52 --> 1134.48]  You know, and then you're devastated.
[1134.86 --> 1137.24]  Like, that's the feature I need, I feel like.
[1137.50 --> 1138.50]  Extra ground beef.
[1138.86 --> 1139.40]  No, I don't know.
[1139.44 --> 1140.86]  I just made something up off the top of my head.
[1140.96 --> 1150.62]  Just going to go ahead and say that if they were going for the premium rich person's market advertising that you will be able to hear what happens at the Taco Bell is not a step in the right direction.
[1150.96 --> 1151.74]  But okay, Teej.
[1152.82 --> 1155.00]  Taco Bell is for the masses, Casey.
[1155.00 --> 1155.70]  That's an Android.
[1155.70 --> 1157.62]  What you're talking about there is an Android feature.
[1158.00 --> 1162.42]  The Android feature is which Taco Bell in my area has the lowest price on this item.
[1162.96 --> 1163.28]  Yes.
[1163.46 --> 1163.70]  Right.
[1164.46 --> 1165.06]  I do like that.
[1165.06 --> 1166.18]  This is why we use Android.
[1166.56 --> 1166.74]  Yeah.
[1166.84 --> 1167.06]  That's right.
[1167.06 --> 1171.94]  I need my agentic demo of it ordering Taco Bell and getting the order actually correct.
[1172.34 --> 1173.56]  And then I get my meal.
[1173.56 --> 1177.86]  That's the Android demo of Google Assistant that we need.
[1178.42 --> 1178.64]  Yeah.
[1179.16 --> 1179.54]  All right.
[1179.98 --> 1180.98]  I did notice something else.
[1180.98 --> 1182.40]  It's like the Android features are all the opposite.
[1182.74 --> 1185.84]  It's like a couch change finder and stuff like that.
[1185.98 --> 1188.32]  It's all features for people with no money.
[1188.52 --> 1189.04]  It's just like.
[1189.28 --> 1194.98]  I will say, though, the funny thing for this is Apple's acting like they're the first people to have live translated in the headphones.
[1194.98 --> 1196.82]  And it's like such a classic Apple thing.
[1196.88 --> 1199.12]  Trash is like, bro, that's crazy, dude.
[1199.22 --> 1199.98]  They're going to do live translated.
[1200.46 --> 1200.96]  What are you talking about?
[1201.02 --> 1206.72]  The Facebook sunglasses, the Ray-Ban Mattas, they already have live translated in here.
[1207.26 --> 1209.74]  There's already a mass market thing that's already out, Trash.
[1209.92 --> 1212.14]  I learned that from Beacon the other day.
[1212.36 --> 1212.78]  I know.
[1213.06 --> 1213.48]  The other week.
[1213.56 --> 1214.06]  I was like, what?
[1214.12 --> 1215.72]  I've never seen anyone with the Ray-Bans before.
[1216.10 --> 1216.92]  Pretty interesting.
[1217.32 --> 1224.04]  Well, you know, that really surprises me because if anyone's on top of great marketing and convincing people that they're cool, it's usually Facebook.
[1224.04 --> 1227.34]  I will say the Ray-Bans actually are pretty cool.
[1227.72 --> 1235.14]  Like when I put them on and I heard like it does that whatever the bone jiggling sound is versus the other one and it just goes through and you hear stuff.
[1235.26 --> 1236.26]  Oh, it sounds great.
[1237.28 --> 1237.52]  It's well.
[1237.62 --> 1238.80]  And so is the Quest 3.
[1238.98 --> 1240.42]  It's a pretty great VR headset.
[1240.60 --> 1245.10]  It's just meta is absolutely horrible at convincing anyone to use their stuff.
[1245.28 --> 1250.88]  Like people were probably more excited about the Vision Pro than the meta Quest 3, even though the Quest 3 is actually good.
[1250.96 --> 1251.16]  Right.
[1251.32 --> 1252.44]  My parents say otherwise.
[1252.44 --> 1253.54]  Yeah, exactly.
[1254.04 --> 1254.48]  Fair enough.
[1254.64 --> 1255.56]  Yeah, Casey.
[1256.40 --> 1256.80]  Sorry.
[1257.00 --> 1258.98]  My mom thinks Facebook actually is cool.
[1259.16 --> 1260.70]  So I'd like it if you would stop.
[1261.00 --> 1262.26]  She's poking me right now.
[1262.26 --> 1263.06]  I use Facebook Marketplace all the time though.
[1263.14 --> 1264.84]  Facebook Marketplace is the shit.
[1265.32 --> 1266.06]  Good point, Trash.
[1266.12 --> 1266.54]  Good point.
[1266.70 --> 1270.28]  That's how you know you've gotten older is when you say Facebook Marketplace is cool.
[1270.58 --> 1273.90]  Like that is the sign that you have hit a certain stage in life.
[1273.90 --> 1275.94]  I do scroll Marketplace before I go to bed.
[1275.94 --> 1281.22]  I'm like, anything local I can pick up that's on sale?
[1281.38 --> 1281.96]  Any deals?
[1283.28 --> 1284.28]  Not even kidding.
[1284.50 --> 1284.96]  It's terrible.
[1284.96 --> 1286.62]  Trash, what are you finding on this doom scrolling adventure?
[1286.62 --> 1289.16]  Well, I'm trying to get a picnic table for my kids for the backyard.
[1290.30 --> 1295.00]  And you know, I'm just like waiting for like someone that just doesn't want their picnic table anymore for whatever reason.
[1295.12 --> 1296.34]  And I can like get it for like five bucks.
[1296.72 --> 1297.14]  Let me ask you.
[1297.14 --> 1297.98]  That's what I'm hoping for.
[1298.44 --> 1301.72]  Trash, can I ask you how many hours you've spent searching for it?
[1301.72 --> 1301.90]  I know.
[1302.08 --> 1308.30]  This picnic table is going to end up costing like $3,700 in like hourly wages.
[1309.64 --> 1311.46]  I'm only doing it for like 20 minutes.
[1313.04 --> 1314.14]  20 minutes a day.
[1314.16 --> 1317.18]  And I look for like a used jujitsu gear, you know?
[1317.78 --> 1318.94]  And then maybe some like office supplies.
[1318.94 --> 1320.26]  It's called amortization.
[1320.46 --> 1321.10]  He's going over.
[1321.78 --> 1321.98]  Yeah.
[1322.10 --> 1324.14]  He's amortizing it across several products.
[1324.46 --> 1325.18]  I got you.
[1326.20 --> 1327.86]  I'm just throwing it out there, Trash.
[1328.76 --> 1330.94]  Maybe Netflix salary not working out well enough.
[1330.94 --> 1332.90]  Maybe you have to go for a used jujitsu gear.
[1332.98 --> 1336.30]  I feel like if there's one thing that you can spring for getting new.
[1337.38 --> 1339.72]  You could be on one of those commercials that they do.
[1340.20 --> 1346.26]  Like, it's like, there are people working at Netflix who can't even afford a picnic table for their children.
[1347.28 --> 1349.88]  Please give generously to the Netflix fund.
[1349.88 --> 1350.24]  Okay.
[1351.16 --> 1352.94]  My kids are going to draw on that thing.
[1353.16 --> 1357.78]  For less than a price of coffee, you can help Trash get a picnic table for his children.
[1357.78 --> 1363.36]  Currently, they're just sitting on the ground and all of their food is filling out all over the grass.
[1363.36 --> 1363.90]  Full price.
[1364.00 --> 1365.42]  And they're eating their sandwiches.
[1365.94 --> 1366.80]  You're welcome, Trash.
[1366.88 --> 1369.06]  We just gave you your nights and weekends back, buddy.
[1369.44 --> 1373.30]  These podcasts have made me hate myself for using Apple, for using Facebook Marketplace.
[1373.38 --> 1374.74]  That's the funniest thing.
[1375.24 --> 1376.66]  Am I a terrible person?
[1376.92 --> 1377.28]  Jesus.
[1378.08 --> 1379.18]  We're totally screwing this up.
[1379.18 --> 1382.40]  On the Discord, Trash was like, I'm not supposed to be here today, right?
[1382.44 --> 1383.92]  And I was like, no, we love you, Trash.
[1383.98 --> 1384.72]  Come today.
[1385.08 --> 1386.44]  And then now this is how we treat him.
[1386.56 --> 1387.38]  He's never coming back.
[1387.54 --> 1388.22]  This is the problem.
[1388.64 --> 1390.18]  He's the star of the show and he's going to leave.
[1390.32 --> 1392.10]  And no one's going to watch this freaking show.
[1392.70 --> 1398.78]  What I wish we had done is that we had not made so much fun of the satchel and seen an inside bat.
[1399.00 --> 1400.06]  I'm getting your satchel.
[1400.34 --> 1401.88]  100% getting the satchel.
[1402.10 --> 1403.54]  I'm getting the orange iPhone.
[1403.82 --> 1404.08]  Okay.
[1404.08 --> 1404.52]  Okay.
[1404.76 --> 1407.90]  I'm getting the live translation AirPods.
[1408.48 --> 1409.96]  You bet your ass I'm getting all that.
[1410.18 --> 1410.48]  Okay.
[1411.06 --> 1412.42]  And I'm going to expense it.
[1412.48 --> 1412.82]  No, I'm just kidding.
[1412.86 --> 1413.14]  No, I'm not.
[1413.30 --> 1413.72]  I'm just kidding.
[1413.90 --> 1414.22]  Just kidding.
[1414.42 --> 1415.92]  Well, Netflix is so multicultural.
[1416.20 --> 1419.72]  Maybe you're testing out the subtitles with your AirPods.
[1420.04 --> 1420.24]  It's true.
[1420.38 --> 1422.00]  Oh, I got business case.
[1422.72 --> 1422.86]  Free?
[1423.02 --> 1423.12]  No.
[1423.28 --> 1423.44]  Phone.
[1424.30 --> 1424.52]  Yeah.
[1424.64 --> 1425.74]  Actually, I expense my phone.
[1425.74 --> 1428.96]  Did they announce anything that is actually something at this?
[1428.96 --> 1432.16]  Yes, they announced something that's something, but I don't think a lot of people caught it.
[1432.16 --> 1435.68]  In fact, I thought it was one of the greatest parts of the entire presentation.
[1436.14 --> 1436.86]  Dinner iPhone.
[1437.22 --> 1448.62]  Which was how they tested the iPhone's scratchability by exploding coin changes and having a very complicated lever move iPhones through the exploding change and breaking bottles and everything.
[1449.02 --> 1449.30]  What?
[1449.30 --> 1453.82]  They set up the world's most intense testing simulation for scratchability.
[1455.00 --> 1455.44]  Okay.
[1455.44 --> 1456.52]  That part of the video was cool.
[1456.86 --> 1457.70]  That part of the video was cool.
[1457.70 --> 1459.16]  They keep throwing me for these loops.
[1459.16 --> 1463.10]  So, I keep saying, oh, they must be going for the rich, high-end marketing.
[1463.34 --> 1464.64]  Who has change?
[1466.08 --> 1466.48]  Exactly.
[1466.48 --> 1467.30]  What are they testing?
[1467.52 --> 1468.82]  What is this supposed to test?
[1469.48 --> 1470.62]  That it doesn't get scratched?
[1471.44 --> 1472.88]  Casey, that's such a good point.
[1473.18 --> 1476.38]  Because how would your iPhone get scratched in the iPhone satchel?
[1477.54 --> 1479.44]  There's no change in an iPhone satchel.
[1479.44 --> 1490.52]  Shouldn't it be something like, oh, we set up a thing that launches 1,500 designer handbags from Gucci and Bulgari and stuff into the air.
[1490.90 --> 1493.32]  And then we just like, there's iPhones in all of them.
[1493.38 --> 1499.14]  And we just ram them around with a bunch of stuff in there that's meant to, you know, an entire full purse.
[1499.14 --> 1501.96]  And then we just like, see what comes out.
[1502.20 --> 1503.10]  Like, what changed?
[1503.22 --> 1504.44]  What are we talking about here?
[1504.64 --> 1506.52]  How do we go back to Android use?
[1507.16 --> 1511.38]  I like when they do, you know, they just have the machine that like, punches a seat a thousand times, right?
[1511.38 --> 1512.10]  To make sure it's good.
[1512.38 --> 1515.16]  It should be like, inserting it into a Gucci bag and pulling it out.
[1515.16 --> 1515.64]  There you go.
[1515.70 --> 1518.58]  Like, how many times does it hit the zipper?
[1518.58 --> 1519.10]  It's a full Gucci bag.
[1519.18 --> 1520.00]  So, stuff is moving.
[1520.28 --> 1520.84]  Eyeliner.
[1521.16 --> 1521.44]  Yeah.
[1521.76 --> 1522.22]  Tap sec.
[1522.22 --> 1522.44]  Exactly.
[1523.06 --> 1526.24]  Like, and they should show it rubbing up against thousand dollar bills.
[1526.24 --> 1526.56]  Yes.
[1526.56 --> 1530.06]  You know, just like, I don't have change, but I might have like a few thousand dollar bills in my pocket.
[1530.18 --> 1531.08]  Does it scratch against that?
[1531.08 --> 1532.54]  Plugging into your luxury car charging port.
[1532.78 --> 1533.66]  Ah, there you go.
[1533.78 --> 1534.04]  Yes.
[1534.30 --> 1534.54]  You know?
[1534.78 --> 1540.42]  They could also do like, we wanted to make sure that your hundred dollar bills don't get defaced by the iPhone.
[1540.54 --> 1546.78]  So, we also checked to make sure Benjamin Franklin's face was perfectly visible after our 10,000 insertion test.
[1547.18 --> 1552.26]  And they just pulled up the, you know, the BFD, the Benjamin Franklin degradation.
[1552.62 --> 1552.98]  Yes.
[1552.98 --> 1553.50]  Yes.
[1553.50 --> 1554.66]  What's our BFD mark?
[1554.66 --> 1556.54]  We ran BFD mark on this.
[1557.22 --> 1558.52]  Is this for the screen?
[1559.36 --> 1560.84]  It is for the screen, Trash.
[1560.92 --> 1561.04]  Yeah.
[1561.06 --> 1561.46]  There you go.
[1566.12 --> 1569.06]  How many times have we got over up to get over there?
[1571.84 --> 1573.00]  Oh, yeah.
[1575.12 --> 1575.84]  Oh, God.
[1575.88 --> 1577.72]  I'm the biggest Apple user ever.
[1577.90 --> 1578.48]  This is crazy.
[1578.80 --> 1579.06]  Oh, my goodness.
[1579.26 --> 1580.12]  That's funny, Trash.
[1580.42 --> 1583.00]  I only had this because I went to Vegas and I didn't spend it.
[1583.00 --> 1584.56]  I'll do the Android test.
[1584.58 --> 1588.92]  If that's not the opening of this podcast, then I quit.
[1588.92 --> 1591.66]  That is the lead of the podcast.
[1591.66 --> 1592.74]  That is amazing.
[1595.52 --> 1596.08]  Man.
[1596.32 --> 1597.00]  That is ridiculous.
[1597.28 --> 1598.76]  I am a stereotypical Apple user.
[1598.96 --> 1599.14]  Jesus.
[1599.14 --> 1603.14]  Casey, I hear that they brought Matmul to the GPUs.
[1603.32 --> 1603.68]  Okay.
[1604.36 --> 1607.42]  Which apparently makes things much faster for various operations.
[1608.00 --> 1614.92]  Probably just AI unless they're talking about Matmul for, you know, for full floating point or something like that.
[1615.48 --> 1616.08]  I don't think so.
[1616.66 --> 1618.54]  Assuming that they're talking about low precision Matmul.
[1618.66 --> 1619.64]  I mean, I have to see the thing.
[1619.80 --> 1621.02]  That's AI, right?
[1621.02 --> 1623.76]  So, I assume this is for the Apple intelligence.
[1623.94 --> 1625.76]  The trash test isn't there, I guess.
[1625.90 --> 1627.14]  So, I don't know what it's for.
[1627.40 --> 1629.74]  Let me actually check and see if it's enabled.
[1630.04 --> 1631.16]  I don't even know how to use this thing.
[1631.46 --> 1641.38]  Because, yeah, Matmul generally, if they have an accelerated Matmul, I mean, those are things to exploit the fact that you know the order of operations in a matrix multiply.
[1641.38 --> 1643.30]  So, you can do them more efficiently.
[1644.30 --> 1650.94]  And so, presumably, they are just saying, like, we want to have AI run well on this part.
[1652.24 --> 1653.50]  Presumably, this is in the GPU.
[1654.24 --> 1654.72]  Yeah.
[1654.84 --> 1655.66]  But I guess I don't know.
[1656.26 --> 1656.42]  Yeah.
[1656.44 --> 1657.82]  Without seeing the thing.
[1657.92 --> 1658.70]  I mean, GPU.
[1658.86 --> 1664.12]  It's in the GPU cores of the A-series chip, whatever A-series they're on at this point.
[1664.54 --> 1664.94]  19.
[1665.38 --> 1670.88]  So, on A19, presumably, the GPUs have this accelerated, whereas I guess they didn't before.
[1671.38 --> 1671.78]  Yeah.
[1673.24 --> 1675.90]  I don't study A-series hard for, so I don't know.
[1675.92 --> 1680.66]  They said the word local model quite a few times during the presentation.
[1680.80 --> 1686.76]  So, my guess is that they're gearing up to be in some sort of, like, they're actually thinking about local models.
[1687.12 --> 1690.78]  But my guess is that because it's Apple, it's going to be like a walled garden local model.
[1690.96 --> 1692.78]  It's like a local model, but not really a local model.
[1693.08 --> 1696.34]  Oh, it's like we specified which local model you get to run kind of a thing.
[1696.64 --> 1697.00]  Yes.
[1697.18 --> 1698.12]  The Apple local model.
[1698.58 --> 1698.84]  Gotcha.
[1698.84 --> 1698.92]  Gotcha.
[1699.76 --> 1702.06]  You can't own the numbers.
[1702.30 --> 1703.52]  Like, they have to own the numbers.
[1703.64 --> 1705.64]  You can't own weights in a computer.
[1705.88 --> 1706.94]  That's very dangerous.
[1707.04 --> 1710.30]  These weights are licensed, not sold to you, the end user.
[1710.92 --> 1711.98]  And you have to use them.
[1712.16 --> 1715.26]  Each weight was notarized by the Apple notary service.
[1715.26 --> 1716.58]  Tim Cook signed each one.
[1716.64 --> 1719.12]  That's why they haven't released any new or interesting features.
[1719.44 --> 1721.92]  He's been spending all of his time signing the weights.
[1722.14 --> 1722.36]  Yep.
[1723.02 --> 1723.26]  Yep.
[1723.28 --> 1723.86]  But what can you do?
[1723.86 --> 1724.88]  You got to make sure they're safe.
[1725.54 --> 1725.70]  Yep.
[1725.84 --> 1730.50]  There was actually, I know we're kind of getting a little off topic, but Anthropic is apparently
[1730.50 --> 1734.10]  endorsing a California bill called SB 53.
[1734.62 --> 1738.62]  And I believe part of that actually had some sort of limiting amount of flops.
[1738.72 --> 1742.26]  The bill currently decides which AI systems to regulate based on how much computing power
[1742.26 --> 1743.50]  flops they were used to train.
[1743.92 --> 1745.98]  The current threshold is 10 to the 26 flops.
[1745.98 --> 1749.34]  And they do some sort of like regulation based on flops.
[1749.78 --> 1753.14]  Are we on Super Bowl like 56 or something like that?
[1754.30 --> 1755.58]  Is that how many flops are on?
[1755.58 --> 1756.48]  SB 53 happened a while ago.
[1756.74 --> 1763.20]  So, I mean, the total number of flops that got executed through the entire training run?
[1763.98 --> 1764.46]  I don't know.
[1764.96 --> 1765.70]  That's the idea here?
[1765.80 --> 1768.48]  It was only one sentence, which does not make a lot of sense.
[1769.16 --> 1770.44]  I guess we could go look at the bill.
[1770.44 --> 1775.24]  Will LeBron still be able to play at the Lakers if they limit the number of flops in the state?
[1775.58 --> 1776.44]  Or what's the...
[1776.44 --> 1777.20]  Oh, my goodness.
[1779.00 --> 1780.14]  Oh, my goodness.
[1780.14 --> 1780.48]  What is a flop?
[1780.66 --> 1780.88]  Exactly.
[1781.30 --> 1781.44]  Yes!
[1781.84 --> 1782.70]  I need someone to...
[1782.70 --> 1783.12]  Yes!
[1783.30 --> 1785.36]  I don't even follow hockey and I got that one.
[1786.04 --> 1787.06]  Oh, my gosh.
[1788.02 --> 1788.78]  Oh, my gosh.
[1789.72 --> 1791.86]  That was a great sports ball reference, DJ.
[1792.46 --> 1793.00]  Thank you.
[1793.30 --> 1798.38]  Guys, if you have not seen the clip of LeBron getting knocked over, knocked over, and then
[1798.38 --> 1799.44]  doing this...
[1799.44 --> 1802.84]  Where he peeks out and the camera sees him and he goes, oh!
[1803.76 --> 1805.14]  That's an all-time classic.
[1805.38 --> 1806.20]  That's what my kids do.
[1807.66 --> 1808.12]  Oh, man.
[1808.34 --> 1808.68]  Oh, man.
[1809.48 --> 1809.88]  So, yeah.
[1809.94 --> 1810.86]  I don't know.
[1811.02 --> 1816.74]  It'll be interesting to see who cares about this because presumably somebody cares about
[1816.74 --> 1817.08]  this.
[1817.74 --> 1820.64]  I don't know how the AI features...
[1820.64 --> 1823.98]  I don't know how the public has been responding to AI features.
[1823.98 --> 1831.78]  Like, mostly the things that I hear are that people seem to be using cloud AI stuff a lot.
[1831.94 --> 1838.00]  Like, they seem to be like, oh, you know, I lost my wife to chat GPT or whatever.
[1838.18 --> 1839.60]  It's like the news stories, right?
[1839.60 --> 1845.82]  Or, like, all the kids today just have all their stuff written by chat GPT or whatever,
[1845.98 --> 1846.20]  right?
[1847.16 --> 1855.28]  But I don't know, like, to what extent are people actually counting on AI run at the edge
[1855.28 --> 1855.98]  of something?
[1855.98 --> 1860.86]  Like, to what extent have they been caring about AI running on device?
[1860.86 --> 1861.74]  And I don't know.
[1861.94 --> 1866.20]  Like, have people been adopting those features, generally speaking, such that they will care
[1866.20 --> 1869.34]  about Matmul being on their iPhone?
[1869.92 --> 1870.30]  Anyone know?
[1870.30 --> 1870.72]  Well, I don't know.
[1870.82 --> 1873.02]  But I'm pretty sure no one has Apple intelligence on.
[1873.34 --> 1875.62]  I'm pretty sure when it first came out, everyone turned it off.
[1875.68 --> 1876.40]  I actually checked my phone.
[1876.44 --> 1877.14]  It was actually off.
[1877.54 --> 1880.36]  Because I remember when it first came out, I was, like, trying to give me all these bozo
[1880.36 --> 1881.46]  recommendations.
[1881.72 --> 1883.00]  And I was like, this is stupid.
[1883.14 --> 1884.62]  So I ended up just turning it off completely.
[1885.08 --> 1885.30]  Okay.
[1885.32 --> 1885.88]  But, yeah, I don't know.
[1885.88 --> 1891.70]  I did notice that in the previous years, kind of, like, whatever they call this iPhone-a-palooza,
[1892.38 --> 1895.34]  that they were very heavy into Apple intelligence.
[1895.46 --> 1897.10]  They mentioned it, like, 9,000 times.
[1897.34 --> 1897.52]  Yeah.
[1897.66 --> 1900.12]  This time it was much more of, like, just, like, a background hint.
[1900.46 --> 1904.26]  Like, it was mentioned maybe, like, three more times than the Vision Pro.
[1906.36 --> 1907.56]  So, I...
[1907.56 --> 1908.30]  Which is three.
[1908.68 --> 1910.08]  And give...
[1910.08 --> 1914.96]  I would just ask, so combine that with the fact that, like, I feel like Microsoft's, like,
[1914.96 --> 1918.56]  co-pilot PC thing did not go over well either.
[1918.72 --> 1922.68]  Like, I don't really hear a lot of people going, like, oh, I'm so glad I bought, like,
[1922.68 --> 1930.22]  a Qualcomm Snapdragon PC because all the AI that I've been running on that TPU is really
[1930.22 --> 1932.06]  making me happy, right?
[1932.14 --> 1938.16]  So I'm just wondering, like, is this sort of just more of a forward-looking thing?
[1938.28 --> 1942.56]  Like, look, we expect in five years to be at a point where people are doing this.
[1942.56 --> 1947.72]  So we're just adding TPU stuff now because we just trust that at some point we'll get
[1947.72 --> 1948.28]  these models...
[1949.28 --> 1955.58]  Either the RAM bandwidth and the on-device storage will be such that it's feasible to just run
[1955.58 --> 1958.00]  all of a modern model on the device.
[1958.32 --> 1961.64]  Or we'll get these devices down to smaller things so they run.
[1962.04 --> 1962.80]  And so that...
[1962.80 --> 1967.32]  We're adding TPUs to A19 because, really, it's more about A20 or A21.
[1968.16 --> 1974.16]  Or are people literally like, I can't wait to use these AI features now in the A19 because
[1974.16 --> 1978.94]  there's all these things I was doing on a co-pilot PC that I could do on my phone now.
[1979.06 --> 1980.54]  Like, does anyone have any idea?
[1980.54 --> 1987.22]  The only one that I've seen people be excited about for, like, on-phone stuff...
[1987.22 --> 1989.74]  I don't know about in Apple land because I'm not rich enough to have...
[1989.74 --> 1990.64]  Right, not Apple land, yeah.
[1990.76 --> 1993.18]  I don't have Apple friends except for trash.
[1993.26 --> 1993.74]  I didn't know.
[1993.96 --> 1997.00]  Like, he didn't realize he was, so we'll probably not be friends next week.
[1997.10 --> 1998.72]  He's like, too cool for me now.
[1998.80 --> 1999.82]  He realized...
[1999.82 --> 2001.00]  I can smell the porn.
[2001.00 --> 2002.80]  He's like, all your texts are showing up the wrong color.
[2003.54 --> 2003.94]  Yeah.
[2004.40 --> 2007.50]  The only one that I've seen is when you can do stuff with, like, your photos.
[2007.50 --> 2011.50]  Like, you know where you can, like, magic erase something and, like, they disappear.
[2011.94 --> 2016.98]  Or, like, oh, I need to, like, combine three photos because my kids always look in a different
[2016.98 --> 2020.64]  direction every single one and so we can't line all of them up at the same time.
[2020.86 --> 2027.72]  I feel like that's the only, like, scenario that I've seen people like, oh, that's really
[2027.72 --> 2028.68]  cool and useful.
[2028.68 --> 2030.20]  I would, like, actually use that.
[2030.26 --> 2033.88]  I don't think anyone's like, I really hope it can summarize my texts faster.
[2033.88 --> 2038.44]  Like, I really need my texts to be summarized in 13 milliseconds or something like that
[2038.44 --> 2042.06]  because I can't read the text from my mom that says, like, see you at 5 p.m. for dinner.
[2042.38 --> 2042.50]  You know?
[2042.68 --> 2046.28]  Are people actually using the combine three photos thing or they just think it's cool?
[2046.36 --> 2047.06]  Because that's my...
[2047.06 --> 2050.84]  Like, I agree that they would think it was cool, but I'm like, is anyone actually using
[2050.84 --> 2052.00]  these or do they just don't care?
[2052.20 --> 2052.30]  Okay.
[2052.60 --> 2053.38]  Oh, I've used it.
[2053.44 --> 2058.24]  So then in that case, that alone would probably be enough to justify something like this
[2058.24 --> 2061.78]  because if you don't have MatMul, you're not going to be running much of a model,
[2061.78 --> 2064.90]  like, really, like, the speed difference is pretty dramatic, right?
[2065.08 --> 2065.38]  So...
[2065.38 --> 2071.20]  I only know of it, like, on Pixel, basically, and Google ships their own...
[2071.20 --> 2072.76]  So, like, Google is doing the same thing, right?
[2072.76 --> 2076.98]  Google is shipping, like, custom chip setup pipeline, blah, blah, blah, everything for
[2076.98 --> 2081.98]  their Pixel line and then doing special stuff in it for, like, local or, like, on-device,
[2082.54 --> 2084.74]  like, AI things.
[2084.92 --> 2089.84]  Like, Google now sometimes even will, like, it doesn't do yet, but I'm sure it will, like,
[2089.84 --> 2094.22]  auto-combine it already picks, like, it takes a bunch of pictures and picks the one that's,
[2094.34 --> 2098.04]  like, best where most people are, like, looking at the camera or whatever, right?
[2098.20 --> 2104.44]  And so, like, those are, I think, like, actually, you know, people would use those and taking
[2104.44 --> 2106.08]  pictures is, like, a big part of why people have phones.
[2106.08 --> 2106.94]  It's a big part of it, yeah.
[2106.94 --> 2108.84]  So that part makes sense.
[2109.16 --> 2114.06]  So it seems like that would be enough probably to justify this, especially if it's something
[2114.06 --> 2116.66]  that you're expecting to happen quickly on the phone.
[2116.94 --> 2119.96]  Like, you need an oil and also low power.
[2120.44 --> 2124.58]  Like, another thing is, like, the more efficient you can do the calculations, often sometimes
[2124.58 --> 2127.12]  it's not necessarily about how fast the turnaround is.
[2127.16 --> 2132.48]  It's just like, look, we could do this, you know, fast enough just using the CPU or just
[2132.48 --> 2136.44]  using the existing GPU molt, but it's like it eats a lot more power, right?
[2136.52 --> 2139.56]  And so that's no good because then your battery life stats look crappy.
[2139.56 --> 2143.42]  And when the reviewer goes and photographs his kids, it's like, oh, I lost all my juice,
[2143.68 --> 2143.88]  whatever.
[2144.14 --> 2145.20]  So it's okay.
[2145.38 --> 2147.56]  So that's probably it then, I guess.
[2147.72 --> 2150.40]  And then future, like, well, maybe it'll be used for something else in the future.
[2150.60 --> 2150.88]  Who knows?
[2151.14 --> 2154.54]  Can I be the boomer about phones and just be like, what's up with all the phones getting
[2154.54 --> 2155.26]  super thin?
[2155.92 --> 2156.80]  Can I just have, like, a battery?
[2156.80 --> 2157.96]  Yeah, I don't understand that.
[2158.30 --> 2160.06]  I just want a five-day battery.
[2160.40 --> 2162.54]  Is that so much to ask, Tim Apple?
[2163.54 --> 2164.56]  Five-day battery.
[2164.68 --> 2165.94]  What's the battery on the thin one?
[2165.94 --> 2170.18]  You can buy cases, TJ, that just make your phone thicker and are a second battery.
[2170.44 --> 2171.42]  Oh, good idea.
[2171.50 --> 2172.70]  I actually didn't even think about that.
[2172.96 --> 2175.58]  Yeah, so why don't you quit being such a boomer and just get a boomer case?
[2175.60 --> 2176.32]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[2176.36 --> 2178.12]  I already said I was the boomer about this situation.
[2178.22 --> 2180.68]  I'm already yelling at the cloud, you know, so I get that.
[2180.92 --> 2184.78]  Well, but you do have to ask the question is, who are these thin phones for?
[2185.14 --> 2186.92]  Because everyone puts a case on it.
[2187.02 --> 2190.42]  So why don't you just make the phone thicker and have it be grippable?
[2190.78 --> 2192.70]  And then we wouldn't need to do that.
[2193.30 --> 2193.84]  Thank you.
[2193.84 --> 2195.92]  An internal case would be really nice.
[2196.14 --> 2197.00]  Because that's the test.
[2197.10 --> 2204.20]  Instead of having this, like, silly experiment where someone spent, like, $5 million setting up the perfect iPhone drop and all that,
[2204.56 --> 2211.16]  can we just have something that someone just drops the phone a hundred times from nipple high?
[2211.52 --> 2213.26]  And be like, when does it break?
[2213.32 --> 2218.52]  How many nipple high drops of the average male does it take for phone to crack?
[2218.54 --> 2219.96]  Well, not all nipple heights are the same.
[2220.12 --> 2220.76]  He said average.
[2221.18 --> 2221.82]  He said average.
[2221.82 --> 2223.70]  He's going with the mean.
[2223.80 --> 2225.64]  5.9 worldwide, 5.11 America.
[2226.00 --> 2226.86]  This is a mean nipple.
[2227.50 --> 2231.84]  He's asking for mean nipple height, or MNH, as it's called in human factors engineering.
[2232.54 --> 2232.72]  Yeah.
[2232.88 --> 2233.02]  Yeah.
[2234.14 --> 2235.38]  The MNH drops.
[2235.58 --> 2236.48]  How many MNH drops?
[2236.48 --> 2237.32]  You'd be safer, dude.
[2237.38 --> 2238.22]  You should be happy.
[2239.04 --> 2239.22]  Yeah.
[2239.30 --> 2241.12]  My phone sounds pretty safe.
[2241.46 --> 2244.06]  What if you have a built-in case and you can't customize it?
[2244.10 --> 2244.88]  People want to customize.
[2245.18 --> 2245.40]  Yeah.
[2245.40 --> 2246.24]  No, they don't.
[2246.38 --> 2250.24]  Apple's like, guys, a big feature is we released a phone in orange.
[2251.08 --> 2251.52]  This is not.
[2251.68 --> 2255.52]  They actually did highlight orange as a specific feature, TJ.
[2255.64 --> 2256.90]  I heard it was because of thermal.
[2256.90 --> 2257.96]  And that shit blew my mind.
[2257.96 --> 2258.54]  All right.
[2259.04 --> 2260.62]  I was like, orange.
[2260.88 --> 2261.10]  Fuck.
[2261.16 --> 2262.06]  This will be my favorite color.
[2262.38 --> 2263.80]  It's ironically my favorite color.
[2263.90 --> 2264.22]  I was like.
[2264.22 --> 2272.98]  But you bet your bottom dollar I'm showing up with that at some point.
[2272.98 --> 2282.78]  I do want to see a 20% increase in MNH or in MNs drops and MNDs before cracking.
[2282.94 --> 2283.86]  Like, that's what I want to see.
[2284.14 --> 2284.24]  Yeah.
[2285.00 --> 2285.22]  Yeah.
[2285.22 --> 2286.66]  What's.
[2286.76 --> 2287.52]  We need.
[2288.52 --> 2299.76]  So is it possible for Apple to create a position that's like the nipple drop, like nipple drop, director of nipple drop experiments?
[2300.12 --> 2300.22]  Right.
[2300.28 --> 2300.96]  Like how.
[2301.40 --> 2306.84]  Like there's someone who's going to do this kind of like large scale testing for that.
[2306.84 --> 2312.28]  And also they can do the Gucci handbag insertions or G.H.I.s.
[2312.76 --> 2313.72]  Imagine how.
[2314.02 --> 2314.74]  $100 bill rubbing.
[2315.82 --> 2325.20]  Apple would be able to make a sweet, like really artsy, make you feel bad about yourself unless you're an Apple user video of them doing those tests, though.
[2325.28 --> 2325.78]  You know what I mean?
[2325.78 --> 2326.02]  Yes.
[2326.06 --> 2328.84]  I do feel like they still got the production crew.
[2328.96 --> 2330.18]  Those guys are still there.
[2330.26 --> 2331.08]  They're still hanging out.
[2331.54 --> 2335.16]  I mean, it does feel like a little bit, you know, I don't know.
[2335.96 --> 2338.00]  Feels like Vercel still kind of got them.
[2338.00 --> 2345.74]  But they could put together a sweet video of the Gucci test station and they would eat that up.
[2345.84 --> 2347.94]  Apple TV Plus exclusive as well.
[2348.06 --> 2351.06]  It's like you have to pay to watch the Apple documentary.
[2351.06 --> 2360.30]  It's kind of like when Nintendo released the schematics of the Nintendo that you could walk around on for the Nintendo Switch 2, but you had to buy it for $80 or whatever it was.
[2360.36 --> 2361.02]  And you're just like, really?
[2361.02 --> 2361.16]  What?
[2361.62 --> 2364.30]  I have to buy the tutorial for $80.
[2365.74 --> 2367.06]  Oh, oh, that thing.
[2367.18 --> 2368.12]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2368.34 --> 2369.02]  I know what you're talking about.
[2369.02 --> 2369.96]  Apple would do the same thing.
[2370.02 --> 2371.24]  Apple could do the exact same thing.
[2371.28 --> 2372.56]  You want to see our premium testing?
[2373.06 --> 2373.86]  It's a premium feature.
[2374.36 --> 2374.56]  Yeah.
[2374.56 --> 2379.06]  All features are premium and all premium features cost money.
[2379.08 --> 2380.02]  I'm buying that right now.
[2380.56 --> 2380.82]  Yeah.
[2381.02 --> 2383.62]  You have to verify that you're a serious Apple user.
[2383.62 --> 2387.66]  You must have spent at least $50,000 on the store before we allow you access.
[2387.88 --> 2399.90]  They could also have it so that the only way to buy one of the really exclusive iPhones that we're contemplating is they won't give it to you.
[2400.46 --> 2403.54]  They will only put it into a designer handbag.
[2403.54 --> 2412.56]  So if you don't show up with a handbag costing at least $3,000 or something and open it, they won't put anything in it.
[2412.70 --> 2415.06]  You don't get a device until that happens.
[2415.92 --> 2417.12]  I think they do that with Ferraris.
[2417.16 --> 2418.82]  You can't buy a Ferrari unless you like.
[2419.42 --> 2421.24]  Come in with leather driving gloves?
[2422.22 --> 2424.36]  Trash, were you trying or something or what?
[2424.54 --> 2426.66]  Trash, tell us the disappointing story.
[2427.86 --> 2428.66]  Yeah, exactly.
[2428.86 --> 2431.90]  Tell us about the time you went to Ferrari and got rejected.
[2431.90 --> 2433.98]  I hate myself, okay?
[2434.34 --> 2435.64]  Just stop talking to me.
[2436.50 --> 2437.86]  I didn't actually try to get one.
[2437.90 --> 2438.56]  I just heard.
[2438.88 --> 2439.30]  Yeah, yeah.
[2439.40 --> 2440.64]  You got to be, you know.
[2440.64 --> 2441.56]  It was my sister.
[2441.82 --> 2443.82]  My brother was messaging on the account.
[2444.00 --> 2445.06]  Sorry, it wasn't me.
[2445.06 --> 2451.10]  Do you need a designer handbag to buy a Ferrari?
[2451.42 --> 2452.78]  Hashtag asking for a friend.
[2457.32 --> 2458.44]  All right.
[2458.58 --> 2464.16]  Well, I'm very glad I spent a lot of time watching all the stuff on that Apple thing.
[2464.56 --> 2469.98]  It doesn't seem like anybody else, Casey, was engaged in the Apple stuff, Casey.
[2470.08 --> 2470.94]  Why weren't you engaged?
[2471.48 --> 2477.96]  So I was told, and maybe this is just me, you know, doing some, I realize it's frowned
[2477.96 --> 2483.36]  upon in the modern world, but reading the Discord.
[2483.70 --> 2488.84]  You guys said we were going to talk about NPM getting hacked for the 700th time in the
[2488.84 --> 2489.92]  past three days.
[2489.92 --> 2494.54]  So I know I'm prepared to talk about that, but guess what?
[2494.64 --> 2498.26]  It turns out we're talking about literally Apple posting a freaking ad.
[2498.36 --> 2500.94]  Like, we talked about an Apple ad for 45 minutes.
[2502.04 --> 2503.32]  So that's not my fault.
[2503.46 --> 2505.70]  I don't watch Apple ads because I have some self-respect.
[2506.26 --> 2508.42]  Did you watch GPT-5 announcement video?
[2509.54 --> 2509.84]  No.
[2510.38 --> 2512.38]  Okay, because that was so bad.
[2512.84 --> 2513.04]  Okay.
[2513.04 --> 2516.38]  When I watched this Apple one, I was just like, this is something, this is noteworthy.
[2516.42 --> 2518.02]  We should talk about this comparatively.
[2518.02 --> 2520.02]  It was like, that was the difference between the two.
[2521.18 --> 2524.26]  What did the GP, what was so bad about this GPT-5 announcement video?
[2524.96 --> 2525.92]  Since I didn't see it.
[2527.82 --> 2529.32]  Hey, guys.
[2531.68 --> 2536.76]  Prime here to talk about Chad GPT-5.
[2539.10 --> 2541.68]  And then the graphs, the graphs.
[2542.18 --> 2544.06]  Oh, I saw some of those graphs we tweeted.
[2544.26 --> 2545.60]  They were just completely wrong.
[2545.60 --> 2547.92]  Like, I forgot about that.
[2548.04 --> 2551.90]  The deception graph, having a higher number look lower to be deceiving.
[2552.32 --> 2552.54]  Yes.
[2552.54 --> 2556.94]  In a graph about deception was like, it was the greatest moment of my life.
[2557.20 --> 2557.30]  Okay.
[2558.26 --> 2560.74]  Casey, you know my conspiracy theory about this, though?
[2561.16 --> 2561.42]  Okay.
[2562.02 --> 2562.48]  I don't.
[2562.56 --> 2563.04]  I mean, I don't.
[2563.12 --> 2563.50]  You're going to tell me.
[2563.52 --> 2563.74]  Okay.
[2564.10 --> 2564.70]  Yeah, I will.
[2565.34 --> 2565.74]  Off-street.
[2565.84 --> 2566.02]  No.
[2566.30 --> 2566.62]  I'm kidding.
[2566.90 --> 2567.20]  Okay.
[2567.30 --> 2567.70]  All right.
[2567.70 --> 2568.60]  No, I'll tell you right here.
[2568.62 --> 2569.88]  You never know who might be listening.
[2569.88 --> 2570.88]  Exactly.
[2570.88 --> 2571.44]  Exactly.
[2572.14 --> 2580.74]  My theory is OpenAI intentionally does bad and cringe announcement things because it adds
[2580.74 --> 2582.80]  to their mystique as a nerdy company.
[2583.54 --> 2588.48]  Because they're like, they're just so full of nerds that are so in their ivory tower of
[2588.48 --> 2593.06]  magical AI that like when normies watch it, they're like, wow, these guys all look like
[2593.06 --> 2594.44]  they could be on Big Bang Theory.
[2594.72 --> 2595.52]  That's crazy.
[2595.62 --> 2596.70]  They're really smart.
[2596.70 --> 2599.56]  And then they believe that the AI is magic.
[2599.78 --> 2601.14]  That's my theory.
[2601.40 --> 2605.46]  You might be running into a bit of a Poe's Law situation there, though, is my only thing.
[2605.56 --> 2607.90]  Why is there so many laws you guys keep bringing up?
[2608.32 --> 2608.92]  Who's Poe?
[2609.00 --> 2610.00]  I gotta look up Poe.
[2610.30 --> 2614.66]  Every damn episode, there's a law someone's talking about.
[2615.30 --> 2617.40]  Why do you all know about these laws?
[2617.94 --> 2620.38]  There's a Wikipedia page full of every law.
[2621.48 --> 2623.08]  These is just the laws, man.
[2623.08 --> 2626.68]  Poe's Law, Goblin's Law, Conman's Law, Murphy's Law.
[2626.68 --> 2627.68]  Too many laws.
[2628.04 --> 2628.56]  I like this.
[2628.62 --> 2632.40]  Trash is Law, which is when you think you've learned all the laws, there's another.
[2632.92 --> 2633.04]  Yeah.
[2633.88 --> 2634.60]  Trash is Law.
[2634.80 --> 2637.22]  Trash is Law is just, why are there so many laws?
[2637.46 --> 2638.30]  I'm really going...
[2638.30 --> 2639.90]  Not really a law, but that's okay.
[2640.58 --> 2644.14]  I'm telling ChatGPT that Eli5 Poe's Law to me.
[2645.18 --> 2645.54]  Nice.
[2646.14 --> 2647.72]  Dude, ask Apple Intelligence.
[2648.12 --> 2648.34]  Yeah.
[2648.62 --> 2649.10]  Siri.
[2649.32 --> 2649.64]  Siri.
[2650.42 --> 2651.30]  Let's hear Siri.
[2651.52 --> 2651.86]  Hey, Siri.
[2651.86 --> 2652.14]  Trash.
[2652.62 --> 2652.98]  Trash.
[2653.08 --> 2655.16]  Ask Siri, what is Poe's Law?
[2655.24 --> 2655.86]  And let's hear it.
[2656.42 --> 2656.76]  Hey, Siri.
[2656.76 --> 2657.40]  What's Poe's Law?
[2657.50 --> 2657.64]  Whoa.
[2657.78 --> 2658.22]  Apple Intelligence?
[2658.22 --> 2660.18]  She was going to say, here's a web result, I bet she would.
[2660.42 --> 2662.22]  Remember, Siri's like five hip statements.
[2662.92 --> 2663.42]  Are you making an appointment?
[2663.42 --> 2664.72]  You want me to turn on Apple Intelligence?
[2665.56 --> 2666.08]  I don't know.
[2666.18 --> 2667.58]  Trash, we've got to find out now, though.
[2667.68 --> 2668.68]  This is a live demo.
[2669.62 --> 2670.22]  Apple Intelligence is Law.
[2670.22 --> 2670.54]  Sorry.
[2670.64 --> 2671.62]  I can't help you with that.
[2671.94 --> 2672.30]  Hey, Siri.
[2672.30 --> 2676.54]  Can you Eli5 Poe's Law?
[2680.74 --> 2681.82]  Put it to the microphone.
[2682.04 --> 2684.46]  It says, search the web or try ChatGPT.
[2685.26 --> 2687.36]  Are you kidding me?
[2687.48 --> 2688.86]  It didn't even talk to me.
[2688.92 --> 2689.88]  It was just a screen.
[2690.16 --> 2691.12]  Are you kidding me?
[2691.16 --> 2691.98]  It was just a dialogue.
[2692.00 --> 2693.58]  Please use a different product.
[2693.88 --> 2694.78]  It didn't even try.
[2694.88 --> 2696.00]  It was just like, I don't know, bro.
[2696.08 --> 2696.94]  I ain't smart enough.
[2697.04 --> 2698.32]  I don't know, man.
[2698.32 --> 2698.40]  I don't know, man.
[2698.64 --> 2699.70]  I'll sit here on Jimmy.
[2699.70 --> 2702.72]  It didn't even try.
[2703.04 --> 2703.70]  Yeah, well, there you go.
[2703.74 --> 2704.30]  There's your answer.
[2704.86 --> 2707.62]  But now I know what Poe's Law is because I just looked it up on my computer.
[2710.10 --> 2711.62]  Can't tell the difference between a joke and a series?
[2711.62 --> 2713.34]  So, TJ, you're hitting up into Poe's Law.
[2714.16 --> 2715.30]  Well, I don't have anything else to say.
[2715.32 --> 2716.52]  I was just asking if that was the case.
[2716.52 --> 2723.16]  I think what you are mistaking, I feel like you may be mistaking a bunch of nerds who do
[2723.16 --> 2727.92]  not know how to make a video for a bunch of people who want to appear as nerds.
[2727.92 --> 2730.10]  Like, it may be exactly what it appears to be.
[2730.26 --> 2731.38]  I'll give you my evidence.
[2731.48 --> 2732.44]  I'll give you my evidence.
[2732.48 --> 2732.72]  Okay.
[2733.42 --> 2737.14]  If this whiteboard was real, I would be drawing lots of connections.
[2737.16 --> 2737.80]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2737.94 --> 2738.24]  Do it.
[2738.44 --> 2739.92]  Because you said conspiracy theory.
[2740.10 --> 2741.44]  So, I want something deep.
[2741.48 --> 2743.84]  Like, this has to connect to Jeffrey Epstein or this is over.
[2743.92 --> 2744.72]  This podcast is over.
[2744.94 --> 2745.32]  Dang it.
[2745.32 --> 2746.50]  We don't have enough time for that.
[2746.58 --> 2746.86]  All right.
[2746.90 --> 2747.20]  All right.
[2747.32 --> 2750.08]  I do have this whiteboard, but I don't know where my markers went.
[2750.58 --> 2750.82]  Okay.
[2750.82 --> 2751.26]  Okay.
[2752.46 --> 2753.82]  So, here's my evidence.
[2753.92 --> 2754.42]  Here's my evidence.
[2754.64 --> 2759.24]  One, Sam Altman is a known hype cycle chaser.
[2759.98 --> 2760.24]  Okay.
[2760.30 --> 2762.42]  Every time he goes on the internet, he chases hype.
[2762.50 --> 2765.50]  He knows and he's raised a lot of money off of hype.
[2765.66 --> 2766.10]  That's fair.
[2766.10 --> 2770.22]  Remember, the day before ChatGPT5 was announced, he did tweet the Death Star.
[2771.16 --> 2771.36]  Yeah.
[2772.02 --> 2773.48]  That's his least good one.
[2773.62 --> 2778.16]  Him going on Reddit and saying AGI achieved internally and deleting it and other stuff like
[2778.16 --> 2785.48]  this and he's, he is really good at it, especially for, I would say, non-technical normies who
[2785.48 --> 2791.04]  are reading it and they think he's this super genius, incredible monster brain guy, which
[2791.04 --> 2793.98]  like, to be fair, he's better at lots of things than me.
[2794.02 --> 2795.18]  So, maybe he is all those things.
[2795.28 --> 2795.52]  Whatever.
[2796.04 --> 2802.34]  But, so he's, and he, there's no way he's getting to the presentation and they're like,
[2802.64 --> 2806.46]  oh, we just didn't prepare and there's no, like, he is doing those things.
[2806.54 --> 2808.04]  He's preparing those things and he's getting around.
[2808.04 --> 2812.60]  Number two, you can watch the video where they did the, like, IO announcement with
[2812.60 --> 2816.06]  him and what's the, what's the ex-Apple guy, designer guy.
[2816.14 --> 2818.18]  I always forget his name and then I want to say Bon Jovi.
[2818.60 --> 2820.58]  Yeah, Bon Jovi bald man.
[2820.76 --> 2821.10]  Joni Ives.
[2821.10 --> 2821.48]  Yeah, I know.
[2821.64 --> 2822.60]  Yeah, that's the one.
[2822.90 --> 2823.00]  Okay.
[2823.08 --> 2825.52]  That's why, so, watch that video.
[2825.68 --> 2830.38]  They know how to put on a produced video that makes people feel a certain way and gives
[2830.38 --> 2830.84]  you a certain vibe.
[2830.92 --> 2834.14]  They made Sam Altman look human in that video.
[2834.14 --> 2836.24]  But who's the they in that sentence?
[2836.54 --> 2837.44]  That's still open AI.
[2837.44 --> 2838.08]  People.
[2838.90 --> 2843.00]  Are you sure it wasn't like Joni was there like, hey guys, you can't do any of this.
[2843.14 --> 2844.90]  Let me tell you how this has to be.
[2845.10 --> 2848.54]  Don't you think if they're doing like a huge billion dollar thing with him, they're like
[2848.54 --> 2852.00]  saying like, yo, come over and help us do our big announcement for GPT-5.
[2852.10 --> 2853.00]  I just feel like, you know what I'm saying?
[2853.00 --> 2857.84]  I'm saying like within the company, like when's the last time Microsoft put out a video that
[2857.84 --> 2860.02]  made you think like, hmm, nice.
[2860.60 --> 2861.52]  Like they just can't.
[2861.52 --> 2862.02]  Steve Ballmer.
[2862.02 --> 2862.20]  Yeah.
[2862.20 --> 2865.94]  When you said last time, you're suggesting that there was a time.
[2866.28 --> 2871.46]  You're telling me developers, developers, developers, alpha, sigma mail edits don't make you feel
[2871.46 --> 2872.48]  something, Casey?
[2872.72 --> 2873.42]  Come on, Casey.
[2873.42 --> 2882.66]  Personally, I feel like the Windows Vista Rocks, like Bruce Springsteen parody video is my favorite.
[2883.22 --> 2885.16]  And so that's the one I would go with.
[2885.22 --> 2888.40]  Although I agree developers, developers, developers was good as well.
[2889.16 --> 2890.92]  So is the one where he goes, who said sit down?
[2891.52 --> 2891.68]  What?
[2891.68 --> 2891.76]  What?
[2892.16 --> 2894.26]  His goodbye speech where he sings.
[2894.96 --> 2895.18]  Great.
[2895.18 --> 2896.48]  I don't think I've seen that one.
[2896.76 --> 2896.82]  Oh.
[2896.82 --> 2897.66]  That sounds really good.
[2897.68 --> 2898.88]  In case you're in for a treat, you've got to watch it after this.
[2898.92 --> 2902.12]  There's also just a television commercial where he's selling Windows.
[2902.66 --> 2906.80]  And I think he says something along the lines of like, you can't get Windows in Nebraska.
[2907.08 --> 2910.32]  And like, that's the ending is that like, they didn't ship Windows to Nebraska.
[2910.46 --> 2913.20]  There was some sort of law in one of the states where there's like no Windows.
[2913.20 --> 2913.40]  Windows.
[2913.94 --> 2921.44]  So my point being, that company is unable to produce a video, regardless of what collab they make or whatever they do.
[2921.54 --> 2921.92]  And they can't do it.
[2922.00 --> 2924.14]  And OpenAI has made those things.
[2924.66 --> 2926.78]  Sam Altman is a hype beast.
[2927.64 --> 2930.10]  And they have insano money.
[2930.18 --> 2932.86]  Now, sometimes insano money means you waste it all and do something stupid.
[2932.96 --> 2933.52]  I get that.
[2933.78 --> 2937.76]  But like, they could at least bring in like a prep team to help people do the presentation.
[2937.88 --> 2939.54]  That's my case, Casey.
[2939.54 --> 2943.88]  I don't know how strongly I truly believe it, but it's just like a pet conspiracy theory of mine.
[2944.20 --> 2952.86]  It's weakened slightly by the comparison to Microsoft, because I guess my counterpoint to that would just be that like, explain Xbox.
[2953.50 --> 2958.84]  Like, actually, they did some pretty cool, like the trailer for Gears of War.
[2959.54 --> 2961.58]  That's a Microsoft Game Studios, right?
[2961.70 --> 2963.66]  The original one was kind of amazing.
[2963.84 --> 2964.40]  It's like Mad.
[2964.46 --> 2965.40]  It's the cover of Mad.
[2965.40 --> 2969.34]  It's the cover version of Mad World with the like exploding things.
[2969.48 --> 2970.56]  Like, that's Microsoft.
[2971.26 --> 2973.14]  Like, they made that video, right?
[2973.62 --> 2978.36]  And they put on some pretty great E3 stuff in the early like 360 days.
[2979.76 --> 2980.20]  So...
[2980.20 --> 2982.20]  Well, then I take back my Microsoft argument.
[2982.52 --> 2983.42]  Just to erase that from your memory.
[2983.64 --> 2987.40]  So I guess I'm just saying like, when we're thinking Microsoft, we're thinking like the Windows org.
[2987.40 --> 2991.56]  And so I think it's very possible that open AI could be similarly that way.
[2991.72 --> 2993.38]  Like, it's like maybe there is...
[2993.38 --> 2996.86]  Maybe when Joni comes over, or I don't know how you pronounce his name.
[2996.92 --> 2997.48]  Bon Jovi.
[2997.82 --> 2998.44]  Bon Jovi.
[2998.52 --> 3002.32]  When Bon Jovi comes over, he's like, look guys, this has to not be so cringy.
[3002.48 --> 3002.90]  Could you...
[3002.90 --> 3005.80]  Sam, could you stop sounding like one of the AIs?
[3006.52 --> 3009.58]  And then when he's gone, it just...
[3009.58 --> 3012.08]  Everyone reverts back to behaving the same way the AI does.
[3012.22 --> 3014.80]  That's always why they're like, AGI achieved.
[3014.80 --> 3016.50]  Because the AI sounds just like them.
[3016.56 --> 3017.48]  And they're like, I don't understand.
[3017.58 --> 3018.34]  This is exactly like a human.
[3018.48 --> 3019.88]  You're like, okay, not...
[3019.88 --> 3022.66]  No, because other people aren't this way.
[3022.76 --> 3022.90]  Right?
[3023.04 --> 3023.78]  Yeah, that's...
[3023.78 --> 3024.52]  You know what I'm saying?
[3024.62 --> 3025.14]  That's pretty good.
[3025.68 --> 3026.26]  That's pretty good.
[3026.62 --> 3027.82]  They're just like, wait a second.
[3027.92 --> 3029.54]  I'm wrong 20% of the time.
[3029.60 --> 3030.60]  And I sound like this.
[3030.70 --> 3032.06]  And they're wrong 20% of the time.
[3032.06 --> 3033.22]  I mean, this is ACI.
[3033.44 --> 3033.64]  Yeah.
[3033.72 --> 3035.16]  I've never expressed uncertainty.
[3036.16 --> 3038.26]  I've never expressed uncertainty in my life.
[3038.26 --> 3038.62]  Yeah.
[3040.18 --> 3040.54]  Yeah.
[3041.26 --> 3042.90]  Casey, that was extremely insightful.
[3043.62 --> 3043.80]  Yeah.
[3043.80 --> 3044.06]  It was.
[3044.06 --> 3044.94]  Oh, I'm just a...
[3044.94 --> 3046.48]  Almost a form of Conway's Law.
[3046.68 --> 3048.46]  I'm just a frickin' fountain, Prime.
[3049.02 --> 3050.62]  Almost a form of Conway's Law.
[3051.82 --> 3053.24]  Conway's Law is when...
[3053.24 --> 3058.84]  The output of the Japanese matches the organ which the Japanese was developed in.
[3059.08 --> 3059.72]  Got it.
[3060.02 --> 3060.58]  So you're...
[3060.58 --> 3066.76]  So basically, in my mind, I'm just thinking OpenAI is basically that Krasam sketch where
[3066.76 --> 3071.10]  the guy's like, hey, I'm Orange DeLong and I love the Embarcadero and my dog Biscuit.
[3071.10 --> 3083.70]  And the other guy's like, we improved the performance of the backend queries by 17%, which was above our target.
[3083.70 --> 3090.48]  Like, I'm thinking it's that, but you're thinking that they're like 5D chessing it and they just want you to think it's that.
[3090.62 --> 3091.42]  Is that what we're saying?
[3091.42 --> 3098.10]  I don't know if I truly believe it or not, but it is my current favorite conspiracy theory about OpenAI.
[3098.48 --> 3099.30]  It just strikes me as it...
[3099.30 --> 3099.60]  It could be right.
[3099.68 --> 3100.26]  It could be right.
[3100.26 --> 3109.20]  It strikes me at least as a possibility because for some reason people forget OpenAI has like access to every powerful and important person in the world,
[3109.38 --> 3120.26]  all of the capital that you could possibly imagine, and then some, and is heavily incentivized to try and make them appear to be the only place to go to get real AI.
[3120.26 --> 3131.30]  Like, it is not that you can't get decently similar results by going to claude.com or like, you know, like you can get some of the same experience.
[3131.60 --> 3136.98]  But why is it that like nobody goes to Anthropics website to ask questions to Claude?
[3137.04 --> 3139.28]  No one says I'm going to go Claude that or something.
[3139.56 --> 3139.94]  You know what I mean?
[3140.10 --> 3140.94]  Yeah, I'm like, right?
[3141.48 --> 3143.50]  Like I literally called Claude Jippity.
[3144.04 --> 3144.26]  Yeah.
[3144.26 --> 3158.70]  So my point, there's a huge incentive for them to make themselves appear to have some mystical, some additional thing that's beyond matrix multiplications appearing at their company.
[3159.28 --> 3164.82]  And if you ask normies like what AI is, they just think that it's magic, right?
[3164.82 --> 3173.78]  So it's like that's why I think there is legitimately an incentive for them to like make this kind of appearance that they're the elites.
[3173.78 --> 3177.72]  They're putting on a show that they are the academic and the intellectual elite.
[3177.86 --> 3180.56]  They're here to lead you to the promised land of AI.
[3180.78 --> 3182.40]  We're the only people that can take you there.
[3183.58 --> 3183.98]  Okay.
[3184.72 --> 3186.46]  We've gotten pretty far off from the main topic.
[3186.46 --> 3187.82]  I have no idea what we're talking about at this point.
[3188.16 --> 3188.40]  All right.
[3188.46 --> 3189.18]  See you guys next time.
[3189.64 --> 3191.16]  Can we just bring up this one thing?
[3191.62 --> 3193.04]  Who here watched the presentation?
[3194.58 --> 3195.08]  Which one?
[3195.56 --> 3196.68]  The Apple presentation.
[3197.24 --> 3197.90]  That's all the questions.
[3197.90 --> 3199.02]  The thing we're talking about.
[3199.14 --> 3200.86]  Yeah, but the whole thing or which?
[3200.86 --> 3201.68]  Yes, the whole thing.
[3201.80 --> 3202.38]  There's multiple videos.
[3202.50 --> 3202.68]  Yeah.
[3202.68 --> 3203.86]  I watched the highlights.
[3204.46 --> 3205.20]  I watched the highlights.
[3205.48 --> 3205.66]  All right.
[3205.70 --> 3211.46]  If you watched every last person speak, they were all clearly trained by the same person because they all did this.
[3212.34 --> 3213.92]  Arms locked.
[3214.52 --> 3216.24]  And they just did this and rested.
[3216.58 --> 3217.52]  This rested.
[3217.92 --> 3218.90]  This rested.
[3219.40 --> 3219.90]  And they all did it.
[3219.90 --> 3220.52]  You're supposed to show your palms.
[3221.32 --> 3222.80]  Dude, so much.
[3224.16 --> 3228.06]  Just, dude, they were playing whatever this, the accordion nonstop.
[3228.06 --> 3229.46]  It was, dude, it was Trump.
[3229.84 --> 3230.18]  Trump?
[3230.66 --> 3231.84]  Trump started this.
[3232.12 --> 3233.62]  Tim Cook's like, don't worry, Trump.
[3233.66 --> 3234.44]  We got your back.
[3234.66 --> 3236.26]  Made everybody speak like you.
[3236.80 --> 3237.84]  Don't hit us with tariffs.
[3238.08 --> 3239.64]  We've got the thinnest phones.
[3239.84 --> 3240.84]  Everyone says it.
[3240.92 --> 3243.28]  We walk into the room and say, wow, that's a thin phone.
[3243.48 --> 3244.56]  That's a thin phone.
[3245.94 --> 3247.96]  But it was, did no one notice that?
[3248.12 --> 3248.72]  Or is it just me?
[3248.76 --> 3251.26]  I started taking pictures of it because there's just so many of them.
[3251.26 --> 3260.96]  Can you post to your X feed, like, just a grid of a shot of each of the people in the presentation with their hands doing that?
[3261.20 --> 3262.36]  Because I would like to see that.
[3262.58 --> 3263.66]  And I ain't watching this presentation.
[3263.78 --> 3264.80]  It's way too much work.
[3264.80 --> 3266.92]  Again, like I said, I try to maintain some self-respect.
[3267.42 --> 3267.96]  Gave it up.
[3269.02 --> 3270.94]  A little company called Apple.
[3275.38 --> 3275.92]  Hold on.
[3275.96 --> 3277.08]  Before we go, before we go.
[3277.64 --> 3279.46]  So, I just want to show you guys something.
[3279.46 --> 3281.88]  So, there's these popcorn things.
[3282.88 --> 3284.78]  And they're like hot fries.
[3285.40 --> 3286.26]  They're like hot fries.
[3286.28 --> 3287.70]  What is going on right now?
[3287.70 --> 3291.08]  They're like hot fries, but they're healthier, maybe?
[3291.50 --> 3296.24]  And I couldn't find these at, I used to get them from like Sprouts or Whole Foods or something.
[3296.36 --> 3299.14]  But they're always, they were always sold out.
[3299.24 --> 3301.74]  So, I had to go on Amazon, fucking order a whole box of motherfuckers.
[3304.40 --> 3305.60]  I had to show somebody.
[3306.52 --> 3309.36]  I was like, I literally went to the aisle.
[3309.46 --> 3310.94]  Looked for them for like the hundredth time.
[3311.02 --> 3312.34]  And I was like, I'm fed up with this.
[3312.56 --> 3315.00]  Busted open up my app and just bulk ordered some.
[3315.08 --> 3316.24]  I was like, I'm done with this.
[3316.92 --> 3318.44]  Anyway, they just had to share it with somebody.
[3318.82 --> 3319.66]  I was really upset.
[3320.42 --> 3321.06]  That's amazing.
[3321.78 --> 3326.54]  That food is, I think the craziest thing you said in there was it might be healthy.
[3328.00 --> 3328.82]  I think it's healthier.
[3328.96 --> 3330.38]  Pipsorn is like maybe a healthy brand.
[3330.48 --> 3330.82]  I don't know.
[3331.28 --> 3332.30]  Maybe Fritos owns it.
[3332.78 --> 3333.50]  Oh my God.
[3334.14 --> 3335.02]  It's comparative.
[3335.30 --> 3336.94]  He said healthier, Brian.
[3336.94 --> 3340.70]  Yeah, I think it's healthier than like the original hot fries in that blue metallic bag.
[3341.18 --> 3341.50]  Okay.
[3342.58 --> 3343.20]  I don't know.
[3343.60 --> 3344.64]  Anyways, check them out.
[3344.74 --> 3345.22]  Pretty tasty.
[3345.92 --> 3346.70]  Hashtag yeah, not out here.
[3346.70 --> 3348.44]  Is this an ad, Trash?
[3348.64 --> 3349.38]  No, it's not.
[3349.48 --> 3350.16]  You know, they're going to want to cut, Trash.
[3350.16 --> 3351.98]  I just wanted to share my...
[3351.98 --> 3353.36]  They're going to want to cut, you know.
[3353.36 --> 3354.68]  I just wanted to share it with somebody.
[3354.68 --> 3355.48]  I haven't told anybody.
[3355.48 --> 3357.10]  It doesn't do this for free, my man.
[3357.18 --> 3359.78]  Yeah, Trash, you got to split it with us at least.
[3359.88 --> 3360.72]  Come on, dude.
[3360.72 --> 3364.08]  Bring some to the tower so you guys can try it.
[3364.20 --> 3364.94]  It's pretty good.
[3365.38 --> 3366.10]  I'll bring a box.
[3366.10 --> 3366.88]  Oh my goodness.
[3367.62 --> 3367.92]  All right.
[3368.02 --> 3368.78]  Well, that was crazy.
[3368.78 --> 3373.34]  I want to see if all of the things with Trash from now on, like somehow Pipcorn is like
[3373.34 --> 3374.70]  sneaking into it.
[3375.12 --> 3377.84]  It's like he comes onto the tower and he's like, oh, sorry.
[3378.04 --> 3381.50]  I just hadn't quite finished my bag of delicious Pipcorn yet.
[3381.60 --> 3382.28]  So I finished it.
[3382.40 --> 3383.80]  Just figured I'd finish it here.
[3384.06 --> 3384.86]  Pipcorn, if you're...
[3384.86 --> 3390.66]  Everyone go and tag Pipcorn right now in an appropriate, non-harassing way and say that
[3390.66 --> 3395.48]  they would be a great sponsor of the stand-up and we can have them send more boxes to Trash's
[3395.48 --> 3395.94]  house.
[3396.30 --> 3396.60]  Yes.
[3396.68 --> 3396.94]  Yes.
[3396.94 --> 3399.62]  We will get Trash a lifetime supply of Pipcorn if possible.
[3399.62 --> 3404.76]  I want that whole wall behind you, Trash, to be Pipcorn bags to the ceiling.
[3405.68 --> 3407.74]  Speaking of which, this wall is supposed to be decorated.
[3407.82 --> 3409.42]  You see these pictures right here?
[3409.86 --> 3410.52]  Is that a peloton?
[3410.70 --> 3411.56]  I bought these in January.
[3411.74 --> 3412.66]  I was supposed to hang these up.
[3412.66 --> 3413.06]  They're just sitting there.
[3413.24 --> 3415.58]  I was supposed to hang these up and I haven't done it yet.
[3416.24 --> 3417.20]  Hey, Trash, is that a peloton?
[3417.94 --> 3418.82]  That is a peloton.
[3419.28 --> 3419.32]  Yeah.
[3419.32 --> 3420.96]  Mine doesn't even work anymore.
[3421.10 --> 3422.94]  I actually can't even ride a bike.
[3423.10 --> 3424.34]  This is like an inverse ad.
[3424.68 --> 3426.16]  Now you're inverse adding peloton.
[3426.40 --> 3427.66]  This is not going to get you more sponsorships.
[3427.66 --> 3429.96]  Peloton is the single worst company in the universe.
[3430.20 --> 3431.54]  I hate them.
[3431.72 --> 3433.48]  Since we did it, I thought opposite.
[3433.60 --> 3435.10]  I don't subscribe at this point.
[3435.34 --> 3436.48]  I can't do...
[3436.48 --> 3439.78]  It was so bad that I couldn't even do a free ride.
[3440.10 --> 3442.58]  They changed their menu so you can't even free ride.
[3442.64 --> 3443.44]  No, that's what I do.
[3443.48 --> 3444.16]  I do the free ride.
[3444.46 --> 3448.20]  I know, but it was now two menus deep and then it started saying, hey, you need to change
[3448.20 --> 3450.34]  your account information and when I changed it, say you need to pay.
[3450.42 --> 3451.24]  And I was like, I don't want to pay.
[3451.32 --> 3451.70]  I'm not paying.
[3451.82 --> 3452.78]  I just want to ride a bike.
[3452.84 --> 3454.52]  And I said, you need to pay if you want to proceed.
[3455.26 --> 3459.84]  And I had to bypass by quickly going faster than the loading and then it would forget to
[3459.84 --> 3460.20]  do that.
[3460.64 --> 3462.22]  And then it just quit working.
[3462.34 --> 3463.32]  Now it just doesn't even turn on.
[3463.54 --> 3466.80]  Now I just literally have a 200 pound bike.
[3467.06 --> 3467.94]  You need to sell that thing.
[3467.94 --> 3469.16]  I can't even ride.
[3469.54 --> 3472.70]  Can we hack sort of the ROMs on this thing or something?
[3472.70 --> 3476.90]  Like, I feel like there's got to be aftermarket flashable Peloton by now.
[3478.98 --> 3479.82]  I don't know.
[3480.66 --> 3481.18]  I don't know.
[3482.08 --> 3483.18]  That's a stream, Prime.
[3483.48 --> 3484.70]  That is a stream series.
[3485.14 --> 3486.22]  Hacking my Peloton.
[3486.90 --> 3488.02]  Make it happen, dude.
[3488.74 --> 3489.58]  That's content.
[3489.74 --> 3491.16]  That's hashtag content right there.
[3491.64 --> 3493.52]  Dude, the problem is I just hate Peloton.
[3493.66 --> 3495.22]  The problem is I also hate biking.
[3495.74 --> 3498.12]  So it's like, well, it's the reward for doing all that work.
[3498.26 --> 3498.50]  Yeah.
[3498.62 --> 3500.20]  Doing an activity I hate anyway.
[3500.52 --> 3500.76]  Fair.
[3501.16 --> 3501.56]  Reasonable.
[3501.56 --> 3507.56]  While you guys are doing hashtag ads, I will point out I ran out of coffee yesterday.
[3507.94 --> 3510.18]  And I have not been able to get to the store to get it.
[3510.38 --> 3511.42]  And I don't know.
[3511.52 --> 3515.00]  Like, I've heard that you guys have something that helps with this.
[3515.30 --> 3516.70]  You should try my special blend.
[3518.56 --> 3519.58]  I'm sending you some.
[3519.58 --> 3522.52]  I'm going to send you some later today, probably, Trash, or later this week.
[3522.66 --> 3524.22]  What is Trash's special blend?
[3524.24 --> 3525.02]  Just bring it to the tower.
[3525.66 --> 3527.28]  Yeah, Trash has its own special blend.
[3527.64 --> 3528.24]  Which is what?
[3529.96 --> 3530.80]  We'll show you at the tower.
[3530.80 --> 3531.20]  Trash blend?
[3531.90 --> 3533.38]  Hashtag ad, ironically.
[3535.68 --> 3536.00]  Perfect.
[3536.78 --> 3538.32]  I'm just the walking cash cow.
[3538.32 --> 3541.48]  All right, folks.
[3541.48 --> 3543.74]  He won't buy a picnic table for his kids.
[3544.38 --> 3547.20]  I'm going to buy one this week, and I'm going to show you a picture of it.
[3547.42 --> 3548.14]  Oh, my God, dude.
[3548.14 --> 3548.48]  That's it.
[3548.58 --> 3555.52]  Like, 10% of the proceeds of all hashtag ad coffee sales goes to try to fun, Trash's picnic table for his kids.
[3556.04 --> 3556.44]  All right.
[3556.50 --> 3557.70]  Well, this was a great stand-up.
[3557.70 --> 3559.28]  Thank you, everybody, for watching the stand-up.
[3559.60 --> 3562.36]  I hope you also enjoy Apple, or you don't.
[3562.36 --> 3562.86]  And avoid a drink.
[3563.00 --> 3565.32]  Si, like, yeah.
[3565.32 --> 3565.80]  I'm going to be in the panic.
[3566.24 --> 3566.78]  City backupDIO here.
[3566.78 --> 3567.30]  Okay.
[3567.30 --> 3567.84]  I'll tell you guys.
[3572.06 --> 3572.76]  I'm not lying to you.
[3575.14 --> 3575.60]  I am.
[3575.60 --> 3576.40]  Dream.
