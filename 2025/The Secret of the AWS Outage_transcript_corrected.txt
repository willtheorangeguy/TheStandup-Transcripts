[0.00 → 1.26] Is everybody ready for this bad boy?
[1.60 → 2.20] I'm so ready.
[2.64 → 3.96] I don't even know which topic we picked.
[4.22 → 5.94] Dude, it's going to be so exciting.
[6.08 → 9.46] You don't even know trash because you obviously didn't read the email that Casey sent.
[10.12 → 13.52] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14.00 → 14.80] Anyway, sorry.
[14.98 → 16.74] All right, today on The Stand-Up.
[16.88 → 17.20] Let's you all.
[17.98 → 18.90] Casey, we're doing your topic.
[19.02 → 19.96] I'm very excited about it.
[20.00 → 20.76] I just cannot wait.
[20.86 → 21.04] All right.
[21.34 → 27.16] Today on The Stand-Up, we are going to be rehashing an older topic, the AWS or the Amazon
[27.16 → 29.28] outage that just recently happened.
[29.28 → 30.38] It was just a couple of weeks ago.
[30.48 → 32.24] I forgot the exact date and forgot to look it up.
[32.54 → 35.98] But Casey apparently got the inside scoop.
[36.12 → 39.54] An actual Amazon engineer came up and said, hold your horses.
[39.66 → 40.36] You need to sit down.
[40.58 → 41.14] No, no, no.
[41.20 → 42.08] You're jumping ahead.
[42.20 → 43.54] That is not what happened.
[43.84 → 45.66] It's crazier than that.
[45.66 → 46.54] Can we just have Casey tell it?
[46.70 → 48.24] It's crazier than that.
[48.54 → 48.70] All right.
[48.74 → 49.84] Hey, Casey, why don't you do the intro?
[50.82 → 52.76] Today on The Stand-Up, Casey will do the intro.
[52.98 → 53.20] Oh, start.
[53.26 → 53.70] It's fresh.
[53.78 → 54.42] I love this.
[54.52 → 54.64] Yes.
[54.64 → 62.06] Today on The Stand-Up, Casey is going to create an urban legend about the Amazon outage because
[62.06 → 65.62] of a ridiculous series of events, which I am going to recount to you now.
[65.62 → 72.66] In the longest, most boring possible way, because this is an entertainment program where we stretch
[72.66 → 73.20] everything out.
[73.20 → 74.86] So here's the deal.
[75.80 → 84.54] If you are familiar at all with sort of the tech scene here in Washington State, it's
[84.54 → 90.46] all kind of around the Redmond, Washington area where Microsoft originally kind of, well,
[90.58 → 91.22] they didn't originally settle.
[91.30 → 92.30] They moved up there, right?
[93.22 → 96.58] And so there's a bunch of tech around here now, and there are a couple places.
[96.72 → 99.26] It's called the East Side because it's not in Seattle proper.
[99.88 → 102.90] In Seattle proper, there actually are Amazon Towers now.
[102.90 → 104.86] There's a Google campus there.
[104.96 → 107.48] There's a Facebook campus there, et cetera, et cetera.
[107.56 → 109.20] So there is stuff in Seattle proper.
[109.44 → 111.66] There's also a lot of tech on the East Side.
[112.30 → 115.34] Kirkland, Redmond, Bellevue, et cetera.
[115.50 → 116.26] I love Kirkland.
[116.26 → 116.64] That is the scene.
[116.94 → 118.60] I get a lot of groceries from Kirkland.
[118.72 → 119.10] Big fan.
[119.96 → 121.04] Kirkland signature.
[121.64 → 123.38] That's named after that Kirkland.
[123.64 → 125.74] That is the Kirkland because Costco's from here.
[126.18 → 127.78] Prime, let's take a field trip there.
[128.16 → 128.44] I know.
[128.52 → 129.32] I would actually do it.
[129.42 → 130.30] I'm totally down.
[130.58 → 131.62] I just got a Costco membership.
[131.62 → 132.52] Kirkland is out there.
[132.52 → 134.58] We would love to be sponsored by you.
[134.72 → 136.18] I would just throw it out there.
[136.56 → 139.40] If there was one brand I would hitch my wagon to, it's Kirkland.
[139.52 → 141.00] I don't have my wallet.
[141.18 → 142.16] Kirkland, I don't have my wallet.
[142.24 → 145.36] But I've been an executive member since 2003.
[145.82 → 147.46] Yeah, show both sides of the card, Prime.
[148.48 → 148.92] 2003.
[150.00 → 151.22] I get Kirkland stuff at Costco.
[151.22 → 157.58] This story will quickly move its location to very close to the Costco headquarters.
[157.94 → 162.40] So that's how sprawling and epic this tale is that I'm about to tell.
[162.94 → 163.34] Okay.
[163.54 → 163.76] I'm ready.
[163.76 → 164.32] I'm invested.
[164.62 → 164.96] I'm ready.
[165.32 → 165.64] All right.
[166.68 → 169.68] Jeff Roberts is going to think I tell this story horribly.
[169.88 → 173.24] He's a great storyteller and tells stories in a really great way, and I suck at it.
[173.30 → 174.70] So he's going to criticize this.
[174.70 → 176.86] I'm sure if he ever listens to it, hopefully he won't.
[177.28 → 179.20] But so here's what happened.
[180.40 → 188.84] I'm at home, and evidently I was playing on my piano keyboard too hard.
[188.84 → 195.20] And I broke the little mechanism inside the C4 key.
[195.68 → 199.00] So now when you push it, it kind of goes like clank, clank, clank.
[199.12 → 200.60] It makes a loud clicking noise.
[201.38 → 202.72] That's an important one too.
[203.18 → 204.10] You hit that key a lot.
[204.54 → 204.60] Yeah.
[205.28 → 211.20] C, a fellow I know calls C the people's key, right?
[211.72 → 213.66] It's also the people's scale, right?
[213.78 → 214.60] It's the people's scale.
[215.14 → 216.70] So C4 key, you need that key.
[216.78 → 217.30] It's right in the middle.
[217.30 → 224.16] Anyway, so I'm like, well, you know, it occurs to me that I probably want to get this replaced
[224.16 → 224.76] at some point.
[225.10 → 229.76] And because I have to do music work on this particular project, it's not great if I don't
[229.76 → 231.38] have a keyboard to use for various things.
[231.38 → 233.42] So I'm like, I should have a backup keyboard.
[239.18 → 245.10] You know, I made a lot of mistakes in my life.
[245.10 → 250.84] I had billions of dollars of venture capital, legions of engineers under my command, tokens
[250.84 → 252.62] on tokens.
[252.76 → 254.52] And what did I decide to do with it?
[254.84 → 256.92] Did I fix reconnecting web sockets?
[257.20 → 260.66] No, I shipped an Electron app.
[260.66 → 268.12] I failed you.
[268.12 → 271.68] I didn't mean for it to end this way.
[271.68 → 292.06] Not even the walls of this prison will hold us back.
[292.06 → 293.70] The love of a founder?
[294.32 → 296.12] You can't stop us!
[296.12 → 303.30] My biggest regret of all is that I'll never program with you again.
[306.38 → 308.78] Tuple, we still can.
[310.58 → 315.24] Tuple, a native app that lets you code together, even from code jail.
[315.92 → 321.20] Free yourself by going to tuple.app and use Code Prime for 90% off your team's first three
[321.20 → 321.66] months.
[322.82 → 323.86] Casey, can I ask?
[323.96 → 326.30] This is not what took down AWS, though, right?
[326.42 → 327.20] Just to be clear.
[328.06 → 329.18] Who knows at this point?
[329.18 → 332.08] The smashing of the keys was so loud, DJ.
[332.08 → 333.96] I didn't know if it was a load-bearing scene.
[333.96 → 334.48] No, it didn't.
[334.48 → 334.98] It was around the world.
[335.34 → 339.74] Like I said, I'm trying to fill an hour with a story that's got five minutes of content,
[339.86 → 340.12] all right?
[340.20 → 341.66] So, like, just bear with me here.
[343.84 → 344.24] Anyway.
[344.72 → 345.26] Go ahead.
[345.26 → 353.08] So, what happens is, I'm like, okay, we could get a replacement keyboard.
[353.56 → 357.92] The Guitar Centre in Redmond has this kind of keyboard.
[358.52 → 361.22] I will go there and get it.
[362.64 → 363.18] That's it.
[363.58 → 365.48] That's what was supposed to happen.
[365.58 → 367.44] That's all that was supposed to happen in this evening.
[367.82 → 368.28] I'm following.
[368.42 → 368.80] I'm following.
[369.30 → 369.70] Yeah, okay.
[369.82 → 370.60] Got it.
[370.60 → 371.38] Get in the car.
[372.56 → 373.48] Go to Redmond.
[373.48 → 376.16] And actually ate dinner.
[377.10 → 379.40] Go to the Guitar Centre.
[379.96 → 380.60] Where did you eat dinner?
[381.20 → 381.50] Sorry?
[381.90 → 382.42] Where did you eat dinner?
[382.42 → 383.46] We only have an hour, TJ.
[383.58 → 384.40] We can't go for all the details.
[384.40 → 384.98] Okay, fine.
[385.32 → 390.72] I ate dinner at a place called Hisashi, which is this, like, sushi place that's right in
[390.72 → 393.26] Redmond Town Centre, for those who know.
[394.00 → 394.58] The sushi.
[395.10 → 395.70] I want that.
[396.16 → 396.40] Nice.
[396.46 → 396.68] Anyway.
[397.10 → 398.02] I had a sake down.
[398.02 → 400.28] I had a bowl of raw salmon.
[400.74 → 401.34] There you go.
[401.46 → 402.42] Best fish, by the way.
[402.46 → 402.96] Best fish.
[402.96 → 404.18] It is the best fish.
[404.38 → 405.12] Yeah, I was just like saying.
[405.14 → 405.62] It's the best fish.
[405.94 → 406.64] Everyone knows.
[406.72 → 408.02] Everyone knows it's the best fish.
[408.32 → 408.98] Casey loves it.
[409.10 → 409.66] I love it.
[409.86 → 410.56] Orcas love it.
[410.68 → 411.36] It's the best fish.
[411.56 → 412.04] There you go.
[412.84 → 414.30] A million orcas can't be wrong.
[414.36 → 415.90] There's probably only 60 left, but whatever.
[416.20 → 417.70] 60 orcas can't be wrong.
[418.86 → 422.24] So anyway, I go to the Guitar Centre.
[422.64 → 425.80] I'm like, I placed this order for keyboard online.
[425.88 → 429.00] They're like, oh, yeah, like, our system doesn't really work at all.
[429.16 → 431.68] So we're going to need a while to, like, figure out how to process.
[431.68 → 432.60] I'm like, okay.
[432.90 → 438.98] So I walk into the back of the place where the keyboards are, and I'm just, like, looking around.
[439.96 → 442.02] And this is when a guy comes up to me.
[442.38 → 443.48] It's actually two people.
[443.72 → 444.14] Like, a guy.
[444.24 → 444.94] I think it was.
[444.94 → 448.38] I think they were, like, you know, maybe not husband and wife or partners.
[448.48 → 448.74] I don't know.
[448.82 → 449.82] They were together, right?
[450.24 → 455.08] So this guy and this girl come up, and the guy goes, are you case of your authority?
[455.28 → 456.98] Or it says something like, your case of your authority, right?
[457.00 → 459.34] And I'm like, yes, I am.
[459.36 → 464.58] He's like, I saw you recently talking about the AWS outage on YouTube.
[465.14 → 465.92] And I'm like, oh.
[466.04 → 467.16] Let's go.
[467.16 → 467.30] Yeah.
[467.30 → 469.38] This podcast got motion.
[469.70 → 470.16] That's right.
[470.54 → 471.22] Am I famous?
[471.36 → 472.76] Am I famous now, too?
[473.26 → 473.54] Yes.
[473.66 → 474.18] You're famous.
[474.66 → 476.56] We got Itchy Lips is famous.
[476.86 → 477.38] Let's go.
[477.78 → 479.04] Itchy Lips is everywhere, bro.
[480.08 → 482.30] The whole world is watching your snacks, Trash.
[482.44 → 483.52] The whole world.
[484.36 → 485.46] Please, watch for me.
[485.78 → 486.00] Sorry.
[486.00 → 490.38] I'm like, oh, you watched the stand-up.
[490.50 → 493.10] I'm like, yeah, it's really popular.
[493.28 → 494.18] I love that show.
[495.28 → 496.68] I'm like, thanks for watching.
[497.16 → 499.68] And I thought that it was just somebody who was just like, I saw you on stand-up.
[499.74 → 500.12] It was cool.
[500.22 → 500.48] Thanks.
[500.60 → 501.60] And I was going to say thanks.
[501.66 → 502.92] And he's like, but no.
[503.80 → 510.66] He goes, on that program, you said if anyone had any more information about what happened
[510.66 → 516.90] in the AWS outage to tell you, it's like, I have something to tell you.
[517.14 → 519.48] I'm like, oh, really?
[520.52 → 521.22] Do you?
[522.06 → 523.58] Did he open up like a secret door?
[523.98 → 525.46] Yeah, kind of.
[525.68 → 525.78] Yeah.
[526.38 → 528.02] This story just gets so hilarious.
[528.02 → 528.54] So anyway.
[529.80 → 534.62] So if you remember this outage, it was a Dynamo DB outage issue.
[535.14 → 539.86] And eventually, I think when we covered it, I don't think they had actually published their
[539.86 → 540.58] postmortem yet.
[540.92 → 543.26] So we were just like, we said, we don't know.
[543.46 → 544.40] It's kind of weird.
[544.56 → 545.86] What happened was unclear.
[546.02 → 547.76] There were some vague things about it, but didn't write.
[548.74 → 550.32] They published a postmortem later.
[551.08 → 555.08] And the postmortem was really kind of confusing.
[555.50 → 559.28] Because what it claimed, and I'll recount this for people now, because we never covered this
[559.28 → 559.68] on the program.
[559.78 → 563.02] So if you haven't read the postmortem, you wouldn't know, even if you watched our old
[563.02 → 563.36] show.
[564.02 → 569.98] The postmortem said that what happened, the root cause, not the fall over effects of Dynamo DB
[569.98 → 571.92] going down, which was this whole other thing, apparently.
[572.76 → 577.68] That the root cause was there's this thing that's like a DNS planner, they called it.
[577.68 → 585.00] A thing that makes a plan that's what hosts should be contacted for what.
[585.00 → 587.00] And regarding Dynamo DB, I guess.
[587.26 → 587.40] Right?
[587.40 → 591.54] And these plans are updated fairly frequently.
[591.70 → 593.10] They didn't really say how often.
[593.18 → 596.66] But this machine is like cranking along, and it's like coming up with these new plans.
[597.42 → 600.62] And then that machine apparently doesn't do anything.
[600.90 → 602.52] It just comes up with the plan.
[602.66 → 603.36] Like, that's it.
[603.36 → 607.24] And there's these other machines called DNS enactors.
[607.76 → 608.74] And I think they're machines.
[608.82 → 612.22] I don't know if they're machines or processes, but there's these other, you know, independently
[612.22 → 617.32] running things called DNS enactors, of which there are multiple, that take these plans and
[617.32 → 619.78] go and set all the DNS's or something.
[620.02 → 622.26] They were not that clear about it, but that's what they described.
[622.34 → 623.94] Does this sound right to everyone?
[624.08 → 625.60] I don't know if you guys ever read this.
[626.38 → 626.98] I read the postmortem.
[627.00 → 628.28] It's like a race condition thing, right?
[628.66 → 629.62] Like, when it just took too long.
[629.62 → 630.52] We'll get to that in a second.
[630.52 → 632.68] But this is the structure of it, right?
[633.20 → 633.40] Okay.
[634.36 → 640.58] And what they said happened was, normally, a DNS enactor, right, it goes through and it
[640.58 → 647.56] says, like, all right, if I'm going to, like, I was told, or I grabbed plan, you know, 12,
[647.84 → 651.82] and I'm going to go around setting plan 12, I'm going to quickly check to make sure that
[651.82 → 655.40] we aren't on plan 13 yet, right, or 14 yet.
[655.48 → 657.54] So, like, I'm just going to check quick at the beginning.
[657.88 → 659.24] What's at the beginning, it said.
[659.94 → 660.18] Right?
[660.52 → 660.84] Oh.
[661.60 → 665.64] I'm going to check once at the beginning, and I'm just going to go, and then if I've
[665.64 → 668.36] got the newest plan, I'm just going to go through setting all the plans, and then I'm
[668.36 → 669.28] going to finish, right?
[670.68 → 675.74] And what they claimed had happened was one of these DNS enactors got kind of hung up somewhere,
[675.74 → 683.22] and another DNS enactor that started up started updating everybody to a newer plan, right,
[683.60 → 684.24] finished.
[684.24 → 691.62] The old DNS enactor, though, started again and put in kind of the old plan back in, and
[691.62 → 697.90] then they hand-wavingly said something like, and then because it was trying to clean up
[697.90 → 700.08] the plan, it, like, deleted something.
[700.08 → 704.20] Like, deleted the configuration, leaving no way to recover it.
[704.24 → 708.46] And, like, when I read this, I was like, that doesn't make any logical sense.
[708.52 → 711.60] Like, I don't understand what you're actually saying.
[711.80 → 717.18] So, it was an unsatisfying explanation because I'm like, I could imagine something like this,
[717.24 → 719.12] but it didn't all click for me.
[719.14 → 720.90] And I'm like, I would like something more detailed.
[720.90 → 725.48] So, does that all make, you know, you see where I'm confused about the official explanation,
[725.62 → 725.78] right?
[726.08 → 726.48] Yes.
[726.62 → 726.76] Yeah.
[727.40 → 727.74] All right.
[728.16 → 729.30] So, that's all I knew.
[729.50 → 732.52] So, this guy says, well, look, this is what happened.
[733.74 → 735.68] Or rather, this is what happened to me.
[737.60 → 743.44] We, meaning him and the woman that he was with there, it's like, we were at this place
[743.44 → 746.30] called the Black Duck Cask and Bottle.
[746.30 → 752.78] Now, this is a place, this is a like, basically like a gastropod, is what they would call it
[752.78 → 755.26] nowadays, what the kids today would call this thing.
[755.88 → 761.34] It's like a place where you go to drink, but they also serve, like, what is supposed to
[761.34 → 762.80] be upscale food, right?
[763.92 → 766.80] And this place is in downtown Issaquah.
[767.70 → 776.14] It is literally, like, just over, like, there's a highway, Highway 90, runs in between, literally
[776.14 → 780.48] where this place is, just on the other side of the highway, and the headquarters of Costco
[780.48 → 782.34] is right on the other side, guys.
[782.72 → 786.24] Like, the giant new headquarters that they built is right there.
[786.36 → 790.56] Kirkland Signature, the plan for what Kirkland Signature items will be coming out next year
[790.56 → 792.48] is happening in that headquarters.
[792.96 → 794.34] Split keyboard, please.
[794.94 → 795.90] Just throwing that out there.
[796.46 → 796.64] Yeah.
[796.74 → 798.22] Kirkland Split Keyboard, I would buy.
[798.60 → 801.88] If you guys ever want to come out and visit Washington, we can take you to Kirkland.
[801.88 → 804.60] We can knock on the door and say, hey, we're podcasters, can we come in?
[804.60 → 805.58] Can we get Pete So?
[806.18 → 806.46] Yeah.
[807.18 → 808.12] Can we get Pete So?
[808.86 → 809.56] Pete So?
[809.94 → 810.28] Yeah, yeah.
[810.36 → 815.70] You buy a Costco pizza, and you buy a Costco hot dog, and you wrap the pizza around the
[815.70 → 816.04] hot dog.
[816.04 → 816.14] No!
[816.84 → 818.36] Oh, my God, that's a thing.
[818.62 → 819.64] I will totally try that.
[819.64 → 819.96] Do not do the relish.
[820.06 → 821.34] Do not do relish on top.
[821.48 → 823.74] It is nothing like pineapple.
[823.92 → 824.60] It is very terrible.
[824.72 → 826.80] But Pete Songs are really, like, they're where it's at.
[827.30 → 828.12] But you did that?
[828.20 → 831.74] You put pizza around a hot dog, and then you put relish on it because you were just like,
[831.78 → 832.80] yo, the swag, I'm doing this?
[832.80 → 834.02] Yeah, yeah, that was terrible.
[834.22 → 835.44] But, like, Pete Songs are perfect, though.
[835.56 → 837.46] So it's like pigs in a blanket, but like a pizza?
[837.86 → 838.46] Yeah, exactly.
[839.46 → 840.00] Pigs in a pizza.
[840.00 → 841.12] Hell yeah, I'm going to try that.
[841.30 → 842.00] Yeah, it's good.
[842.52 → 842.94] Yeah, true.
[843.18 → 844.08] I was like, what?
[844.96 → 848.84] Okay, and so here's how we get into the like, I'm not sure what really happened.
[849.24 → 849.98] No one knows.
[850.24 → 852.14] Because this is where we get the information.
[852.14 → 858.76] So this guy says, I was at the Black Duck cask and bottle, and we were sitting next to
[858.76 → 860.70] a table where two guys were talking.
[861.70 → 869.00] And one of the guys, in the middle of the conversation, goes, so you know that Amazon outage that happened
[869.00 → 869.42] yesterday?
[870.04 → 872.48] I, apparently that was my fault.
[872.84 → 874.44] That's how he starts the conversation.
[874.44 → 875.98] Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[876.92 → 878.52] Because this is like a spy movie.
[878.76 → 879.12] Yeah.
[879.20 → 879.44] In my head.
[879.44 → 881.94] This is like, this is why I say, like, we have no idea if this is true.
[882.22 → 883.30] Oh, it has to be true.
[883.30 → 887.90] Because not only am I hearing it from someone, that person wasn't even supposed to know this.
[887.96 → 889.90] They just overheard someone else talking.
[890.08 → 894.56] And maybe, maybe the person they overheard was like a pathological liar who made it all
[894.56 → 894.76] up.
[894.88 → 895.50] Who knows?
[895.70 → 895.88] Right?
[896.12 → 897.14] But here's what happened.
[897.44 → 903.74] Casey, you know right now, though, that guy who was at Scary Name Gastropod?
[903.74 → 906.16] I can't remember what it was, but something about death.
[906.66 → 908.66] He's sweating bullets right now.
[908.70 → 909.72] Because he's like, this happened.
[909.72 → 910.30] No, he's not.
[910.62 → 911.98] Because he doesn't work there.
[912.96 → 913.40] No, no, no.
[913.70 → 914.18] He's dead.
[914.18 → 914.96] This gets better.
[915.32 → 916.26] This gets so much.
[916.46 → 917.22] Just wait.
[917.68 → 918.28] Just wait.
[919.10 → 919.98] I promise you.
[920.22 → 920.74] Shaban.
[921.00 → 921.50] Let's go.
[921.82 → 927.18] The story, the story is so good that I'm telling it, even though we have no idea if it's true
[927.18 → 928.34] and it probably isn't, right?
[928.42 → 929.94] Because it's such a great story.
[930.34 → 930.70] Yeah, yeah.
[930.70 → 930.98] I'm ready.
[930.98 → 931.36] Anyway.
[931.36 → 937.70] So this guy and this girl are sitting at the table enjoying their meal at the Black
[937.70 → 938.66] Duck Cask and Bottle.
[939.36 → 944.38] He, by the way, the guy at least, I don't know about the girl, but the guy at least works
[944.38 → 945.30] on Cloud stuff.
[945.68 → 949.16] So when he hears this, he's immediately like, oh?
[949.50 → 949.66] Right?
[949.78 → 952.74] So like, and she also apparently is very interested.
[952.82 → 954.86] So I think they might both work on this kind of thing.
[954.88 → 955.40] I don't know.
[955.60 → 955.80] Right?
[955.80 → 958.84] Because they both are like, wait, what is going on?
[958.86 → 963.20] So they completely stop talking and kind of like, you know, it's very loud in here, but
[963.20 → 965.32] they're like, let's listen as closely as we can.
[966.04 → 969.10] So the dude's like, yeah, apparently that was my fault.
[969.94 → 975.72] And his, the person across from him who he's eating with is like, how can that be your fault?
[975.72 → 978.00] You haven't worked there in like 10 years.
[979.44 → 979.92] Right?
[980.64 → 983.70] And the guy's like, yeah, exactly.
[984.18 → 990.02] But apparently there was this code that I'd written back in 2012.
[990.02 → 993.54] The end of the, the end of the world.
[995.30 → 996.04] Back in 2020.
[996.04 → 997.00] That's what the mind calendar was about.
[997.30 → 998.70] That's what the this is it.
[999.18 → 1005.36] The whole thing didn't go off as planned, but back in 2012, I wrote this piece of code
[1005.36 → 1011.96] that was just supposed to be an easy way to copy the configuration file from one machine
[1011.96 → 1017.66] to another, because I was trying to be able to like to set up servers very quickly and not
[1017.66 → 1019.80] have to actually manually configure them myself.
[1020.02 → 1023.18] So I wrote this thing that was only for me to use.
[1023.62 → 1026.48] And it was supposed to just do this simple copy operation.
[1026.66 → 1028.22] It's not a production thing.
[1028.30 → 1029.78] It was never released into anything.
[1029.98 → 1032.44] And it was just some, some code that I had used.
[1033.32 → 1042.12] And he's like, well, yesterday or, you know, whatever it was yesterday, I got a panicked
[1042.12 → 1050.00] call from Amazon, and they were like, okay, this code.
[1050.02 → 1053.52] That you wrote is about to take down the entire data centre.
[1053.52 → 1055.92] And we need it to be stopped like immediately.
[1055.92 → 1058.68] And he's like, what are you talking about?
[1058.68 → 1059.98] Like, I don't work there anymore.
[1060.10 → 1062.10] I haven't worked there in an incredibly long time.
[1062.58 → 1065.48] And none of my code would be running in that thing.
[1066.08 → 1071.42] And he's like, the person on the other end of the phone is apparently like, no, like this
[1071.42 → 1074.44] code, it's got your, like, we looked at like the history of it.
[1074.44 → 1076.32] It is your code from like your repo.
[1076.48 → 1077.32] And he's like, yes, okay.
[1077.32 → 1078.28] I did write that code.
[1078.32 → 1083.36] And he's like, well, we need to be able to stop it because it's deleting all of these
[1083.36 → 1084.58] configuration files.
[1084.90 → 1087.14] And we don't know how to get it to stop.
[1087.36 → 1087.72] Apparently.
[1088.10 → 1090.14] This is literally like what the guy is saying.
[1090.22 → 1093.12] Again, I have no idea how plausible this could possibly be.
[1093.20 → 1096.90] But the same idea, I don't really know why these data centres go down for seemingly weird
[1096.90 → 1099.34] reasons that don't make a lot of sense in the postmortem either.
[1099.34 → 1100.70] So I don't know who to believe.
[1100.70 → 1101.20] This is definitely possible, by the way.
[1101.44 → 1105.94] This sounds like standard operating, like Fortune 500 company right here.
[1105.98 → 1106.54] I'm loving this.
[1106.56 → 1106.84] 100%.
[1106.84 → 1113.60] So the guy says, apparently, they found that configuration copying code in the repo that
[1113.60 → 1118.88] I wrote, did maybe some light testing on it or something like this, and then must have
[1118.88 → 1124.02] started using it to actually copy the configuration files from like different machines to other
[1124.02 → 1124.58] machines.
[1124.88 → 1129.28] But I guess it had like a bug or something where sometimes it would just start deleting
[1129.28 → 1131.10] the configurations after it did the copy.
[1131.46 → 1134.66] So when they started actually deploying it to things, it would start like it would do
[1134.66 → 1138.80] copies and then delete things and leave them in like dead states that couldn't really be
[1138.80 → 1139.24] recovered.
[1139.88 → 1144.12] And so they're like, we need the password to something.
[1144.24 → 1148.28] And apparently, like they couldn't tell from the conversation what the password was actually
[1148.28 → 1148.60] to.
[1148.96 → 1153.78] But the Amazon people are like, we need the password to this thing in order to like actually
[1153.78 → 1157.90] go like modify whatever it was, the build, the bucket, the permanent storage of the
[1157.90 → 1162.00] thing, the root password for some container they were running.
[1162.10 → 1162.82] I have no idea.
[1162.94 → 1163.14] Right.
[1164.14 → 1168.72] And so he's like, okay, I do remember that password.
[1168.94 → 1172.08] And this is the part where it ties back very tightly to the stand-up again.
[1172.56 → 1173.48] I do that.
[1173.76 → 1178.48] I do know that password because I use the same password thing for basically everything.
[1178.86 → 1179.30] No!
[1180.90 → 1182.74] It was me all along, baby.
[1182.74 → 1188.54] It's slightly better than primes, which is that he has a different password for every
[1188.54 → 1190.62] month, and then he appends the year.
[1191.98 → 1193.20] That's a dumb strategy.
[1193.30 → 1194.44] I got a way better strategy than that.
[1194.56 → 1195.88] Yeah, Trish, tell us your strategy.
[1196.52 → 1203.36] So the password, because he remembered that the code was from the fall, the password was
[1203.36 → 1207.64] wishbone12 because it was 2012 and wishbone for Thanksgiving.
[1207.64 → 1210.84] So that's the password, I guess, to this thing.
[1211.74 → 1212.00] Okay.
[1212.34 → 1217.56] So he remembers the password as wishbone12, but he doesn't want to tell them because he's
[1217.56 → 1219.84] like, how do I know who you guys are?
[1219.92 → 1220.76] You're just calling me.
[1220.84 → 1222.40] I don't work there anymore.
[1223.26 → 1224.92] How do I know you're even from Amazon?
[1225.08 → 1226.26] Maybe this is a phishing attempt.
[1226.40 → 1227.62] Like what's going on?
[1227.68 → 1229.88] And why don't you guys already know this thing anyway?
[1229.98 → 1231.32] Like, what do you need this password for?
[1231.38 → 1232.74] Like, I don't believe you.
[1233.48 → 1236.14] So he goes, so he doesn't tell them it's wishbone12.
[1236.14 → 1240.40] He's like, okay, here's what you should do.
[1241.32 → 1248.54] If you can tell me the interviewers that interviewed me for the job at Amazon when I went there,
[1248.78 → 1252.38] right, when I was actually working, when I was contracting for them, the people who were
[1252.38 → 1256.40] on like the phone screen or whatever the hell it was, if you can tell me who those people
[1256.40 → 1259.32] were, because the HR department will have a record of that, then I'll believe you're from
[1259.32 → 1259.64] Amazon.
[1259.64 → 1267.46] And the guy says that then he hears the Amazon Go like, get me HR on the phone right now.
[1268.06 → 1271.26] This is like the president's on the phone calling Rambo out of retirement.
[1271.52 → 1275.92] Please, please tell me their HR service was down because the data centre.
[1275.98 → 1276.94] That would have been amazing.
[1277.16 → 1278.40] It would have been checkmate.
[1278.60 → 1279.92] Like they would have been amazing.
[1280.26 → 1280.54] Okay.
[1280.68 → 1282.64] So is this why it was down for multiple hours?
[1282.64 → 1284.50] Is that they were just waiting for HR?
[1285.26 → 1285.70] No.
[1286.28 → 1287.40] Look at the guy's name.
[1287.50 → 1288.32] We got to save the internet.
[1288.32 → 1290.50] So they did apparently get the names.
[1290.58 → 1291.48] They told the guy the names.
[1291.54 → 1293.82] He's like, okay, here's the password.
[1294.56 → 1295.24] Wishbone 12.
[1296.30 → 1296.86] Wishbone 12.
[1297.12 → 1299.24] It could have been so much worse, Trash.
[1299.28 → 1300.54] It could have been so much worse.
[1300.90 → 1301.88] He goes to the bathroom.
[1302.34 → 1303.32] He goes to the bathroom.
[1303.44 → 1304.26] Wishbone 12.
[1304.38 → 1304.40] Wishbone 12.
[1304.40 → 1304.42] Wishbone 12.
[1304.42 → 1304.64] Wishbone 12.
[1304.64 → 1305.06] Yeah.
[1306.34 → 1309.92] So anyway, so he gives them the password, and they're like, okay.
[1310.06 → 1312.16] And that's the end of the phone call, right?
[1312.16 → 1319.92] So apparently, and now I, like I said, I have no idea.
[1319.92 → 1324.82] I have no way to verify the, the, the, uh, veracity of this or not.
[1325.38 → 1331.18] I can say that the official explanation didn't make sense because it didn't sound logical to
[1331.18 → 1335.18] me how this would have really taken machines out because couldn't you just run the planner
[1335.18 → 1336.20] and an actor again?
[1336.20 → 1341.42] It'd be really weird, uh, because they are reaching in and updating configuration.
[1341.80 → 1343.14] So it was just, it was weird.
[1343.24 → 1348.64] Like what I will say is the idea that somebody who didn't know what they were doing pushed
[1348.64 → 1353.90] a copy thing to prod that then went rogue and started copying configurations to things
[1353.90 → 1355.40] completely erroneously.
[1355.40 → 1359.42] And they didn't know how to stop it actually sounds slightly more plausible to me, believe
[1359.42 → 1361.40] it or not, but I have no idea.
[1361.40 → 1364.00] And I also don't know why you would need a password for that.
[1364.00 → 1367.06] That part didn't make a lot of sense, but I could imagine if it was some kind of
[1367.06 → 1371.04] containerized thing, if the password would be more efficient to like edit something in
[1371.04 → 1372.22] the container, I have no idea.
[1372.40 → 1376.04] But why that would have been set by a guy a very long time ago, that doesn't make a lot
[1376.04 → 1376.56] of sense either.
[1376.74 → 1381.74] So now I have two conflicting stories, both of which don't make perfect sense and I don't
[1381.74 → 1382.30] know what to make of it.
[1383.20 → 1393.46] So the conclusion of this for me is, can I get another random person to tell me a corroborating
[1393.46 → 1397.48] story for one of these two stories so we can know what happened?
[1399.58 → 1402.28] Dude, I want to meet Wishbone.
[1402.90 → 1404.02] Okay, that's this code name.
[1404.20 → 1405.66] I want to meet Wishbone.
[1407.42 → 1411.22] I'm sorry that we doxed his password strategy because he probably has like, what, America
[1411.22 → 1411.88] for July?
[1412.74 → 1413.78] He's just like, oh yeah, July?
[1413.98 → 1415.02] That's America 12.
[1415.38 → 1416.96] Or America 26 for this year.
[1417.08 → 1418.14] Yeah, oh crap.
[1418.64 → 1419.26] You know what?
[1419.26 → 1423.98] Wishbone 25 is the password to a bunch of things at Amazon, or not at Amazon, for this
[1423.98 → 1425.60] guy's poor account.
[1426.08 → 1426.86] So I do apologize.
[1426.96 → 1429.44] I probably shouldn't have said what the password actually was.
[1430.48 → 1431.12] Don't worry.
[1431.40 → 1432.52] We won't fix it in post.
[1432.60 → 1433.14] It's too funny.
[1434.24 → 1435.46] It's out there now.
[1435.76 → 1437.48] I apologize, Wishbone 12.
[1437.92 → 1442.42] But if you can anonymously confirm or deny this story, that would be very helpful.
[1442.42 → 1445.10] Because now we just don't know what to believe.
[1446.42 → 1450.70] Honestly, from all my experience, this sounds very, like, everything but the password part
[1450.70 → 1453.18] sounds extremely reasonable.
[1453.66 → 1453.98] Okay.
[1454.94 → 1455.82] That's the same with me.
[1455.94 → 1457.80] That same, same, I had the same opinion, actually.
[1459.02 → 1460.00] You can't copy my opinion.
[1460.12 → 1460.74] I said it first.
[1460.80 → 1460.98] Okay.
[1461.34 → 1462.32] I was going to say the same thing.
[1462.36 → 1462.86] I was on mute.
[1463.24 → 1463.26] Sorry.
[1463.26 → 1467.90] I was kind of just illustrating this whole thing, like, in my head on how, like, it
[1467.90 → 1472.04] was raining outside, storming, it's a crazy phone call.
[1472.92 → 1477.34] I just love the fact that it all started because you broke your keyboard.
[1478.26 → 1478.52] Yeah.
[1478.58 → 1480.02] And none of this would have happened otherwise.
[1480.02 → 1489.16] We would never have known the secret story, the secret true story of the Dynamo DB outage.
[1489.54 → 1493.04] See, that's the thing is, I don't understand why they wouldn't publish that, honestly.
[1494.26 → 1497.84] Just be like, yeah, we had legacy code that was locked behind a password wallet in which
[1497.84 → 1502.60] we had to figure it all out and restore from a very long time ago that was deleting files
[1502.60 → 1503.00] in production.
[1503.10 → 1503.94] That should never have been there.
[1504.30 → 1505.06] I can tell you why.
[1505.54 → 1505.80] Why?
[1506.42 → 1507.14] Sounds terrible.
[1507.76 → 1513.92] Because the MBA's who read that will think that that makes Amazon the worst software company
[1513.92 → 1516.50] in the world, even though it makes them above average.
[1521.26 → 1522.18] Oh, no.
[1522.18 → 1523.52] Oh, no.
[1525.40 → 1526.22] Oh, my gosh.
[1526.44 → 1527.44] Well, that was a beautiful story.
[1527.62 → 1529.58] I'm actually, I'm very happy right now.
[1529.74 → 1531.56] This is, this, this has not just made my day.
[1531.64 → 1533.92] This is, this has made several weeks of my life.
[1534.02 → 1535.80] I'll be giggling to myself for the next while.
[1536.46 → 1537.04] If there was any.
[1537.30 → 1541.04] I was like, I don't really care if the story is true or not because I loved the whole thing.
[1541.22 → 1543.14] Like, the whole thing is cracking me up.
[1543.14 → 1551.14] And I also like, it did remind me that I don't, like, I really wish even, let's suppose that
[1551.14 → 1553.56] the official explanation is the actual accurate one.
[1553.62 → 1554.34] That is what happened.
[1554.40 → 1558.00] This story was just a random, like, guy who was talking at a bar and was just making stuff
[1558.00 → 1558.56] up, right?
[1558.64 → 1560.12] That someone happened over here.
[1560.48 → 1561.86] Totally plausible as well.
[1561.86 → 1567.28] Um, but I don't understand the pathology.
[1567.50 → 1571.50] Like, the pathology they explained for the Dynamo DB thing just sounded really weird.
[1571.50 → 1575.18] Because I was like, it didn't, like, it didn't add up to me.
[1575.28 → 1578.20] And I, and it, you know, it's entirely possible that it's like, well, it's because we've like
[1578.20 → 1582.08] abstracted away the details that would have all made sense where you're like, yeah, it's
[1582.08 → 1584.08] like, it's a lot hairier than what we said.
[1584.08 → 1586.36] But what we said is basically true, right?
[1586.82 → 1588.54] I'd still love to hear that too.
[1588.66 → 1592.30] So if, if any, if someone at Amazon ever wanted to come on, I actually explained like, no,
[1592.40 → 1597.34] here's why the thing could not just run the DNS and actor again and everything was fine.
[1597.38 → 1599.72] Like, you know, that would be cool too, honestly.
[1600.00 → 1600.86] Because I'd love to hear that.
[1601.20 → 1601.56] Yeah.
[1601.56 → 1605.72] I'd love to, I'd love to hear the more technical explanation for what the actual, because
[1605.72 → 1612.32] there was a some guy made a testing utility for Google a while back for like, uh, launching
[1612.32 → 1616.38] things in specific regions and then do some sort of auto deleting and all this.
[1616.40 → 1619.06] And then he accidentally deleted like Australia's pension.
[1619.22 → 1623.66] If you remember that, just like, yeah, this happened to not, this happened to just a few
[1623.66 → 1624.20] months ago.
[1624.54 → 1626.34] And it's just like, we did, this just happened.
[1626.40 → 1628.50] Someone makes a tool that's like, it's great for testing.
[1628.50 → 1631.42] It's just for me for being able to launch and make my tests work really, really fast.
[1631.42 → 1634.56] Then someone actually runs in prod and forgets a hidden magic CLI flag.
[1634.70 → 1638.62] And boom, 90 days later, the entire Australia's pension was deleted.
[1639.06 → 1639.46] Wow.
[1639.56 → 1640.46] I can find that exact article.
[1640.46 → 1646.42] So it's, it's basically like, wow, this thing makes it really easy to change environments.
[1646.52 → 1647.60] That's super helpful.
[1648.08 → 1652.56] It's like, oh, well, it makes it super easy to change environments.
[1652.98 → 1655.72] Casey, how long was this whole encounter?
[1656.38 → 1657.22] Oh, great question.
[1657.28 → 1658.16] Not that long.
[1658.16 → 1661.60] I mean, it was just, they, they literally just came up and that's like, I want to tell
[1661.60 → 1662.20] you this story.
[1662.32 → 1663.20] Because I like that.
[1663.22 → 1666.40] They sit down with you and like, no, we were in a guitar centre.
[1666.62 → 1667.58] Oh, yeah.
[1667.58 → 1668.38] Yeah.
[1668.70 → 1673.76] Casey was playing stairway to heaven, and you know, the guy came up and just loved his
[1673.76 → 1674.26] tunes.
[1674.30 → 1674.76] It was great.
[1675.66 → 1676.42] Oh, by the way.
[1676.46 → 1680.28] So Google, uh, it wiped out all the data and all the backups as well.
[1680.90 → 1681.30] What?
[1681.76 → 1683.74] $135 billion worth of pension accounts.
[1684.24 → 1685.24] Are you kidding me?
[1685.24 → 1690.72] Luckily, Australia had a secondary cloud service to store things in, or they would have just
[1690.72 → 1691.58] been like SOL.
[1692.30 → 1693.20] Who, who was it?
[1693.20 → 1698.02] Someone in the Australia, like who, who, this was a Google person who did this.
[1698.38 → 1698.60] Yeah.
[1698.60 → 1698.78] Yeah.
[1698.78 → 1702.92] Google had a testing harness that would just like help launch up environments and all
[1702.92 → 1703.08] this.
[1703.10 → 1707.40] And if you forgot to set a TTL, it set a hidden TTL of 90 days.
[1708.54 → 1708.98] Wow.
[1709.66 → 1712.34] If I, if I remember the story precisely correct.
[1712.58 → 1712.74] Yeah.
[1712.80 → 1713.30] You need to go.
[1713.72 → 1714.02] Yeah.
[1714.16 → 1717.96] So just 90 days later, I was like, okay, I know where all the stuff is and where all
[1717.96 → 1718.72] the backups are.
[1718.82 → 1720.22] I'll get them all out of here for you.
[1720.26 → 1721.10] Don't you worry.
[1721.56 → 1722.78] I can delete those.
[1722.86 → 1723.68] No problem.
[1723.68 → 1728.36] I do think like, this is, this is a scary thing that you learn when you first start
[1728.36 → 1733.24] working at like a company, as opposed to just like, you know, programming, you know,
[1733.28 → 1740.06] on your own in school or at home or whatever you were doing is like, if you write something
[1740.06 → 1744.22] there, no matter what, no matter, it does not matter.
[1744.22 → 1749.78] Like if you write something, there is a non-zero chance that it will be used for potentially
[1749.78 → 1750.26] decades.
[1750.26 → 1751.04] It doesn't matter.
[1751.10 → 1753.14] It does not matter if it is utter garbage.
[1753.30 → 1754.54] It does not matter if you tested it.
[1754.70 → 1756.80] It does not matter if you put a thing at the top.
[1756.84 → 1758.08] It's like, do not use this.
[1758.18 → 1759.36] It will destroy the world.
[1759.74 → 1760.54] It does not matter.
[1761.02 → 1763.08] People will just deploy stuff.
[1763.76 → 1765.24] It's not even a possibility for me.
[1765.36 → 1769.44] My code is definitely still running in production 10 years previously.
[1769.86 → 1773.12] I was at a meet and greet and someone came up and said, hey, I work at Netflix.
[1773.28 → 1773.84] And I was like, uh-oh.
[1773.90 → 1776.40] And he's like, yeah, I've seen your code multiple times.
[1776.46 → 1779.16] I'm like, years later, there it still is.
[1779.16 → 1780.34] All right, let's go, baby.
[1780.86 → 1782.14] And so it does happen.
[1782.72 → 1785.68] Oh, by the way, I personally think this is why A-B testing sucks.
[1786.02 → 1786.88] I'm going to throw this out there.
[1786.94 → 1792.58] Hot take coming in is because with A-B testing, you kind of go like a little bit more Rambo
[1792.58 → 1794.04] style, a little bit cowboy coding.
[1794.26 → 1798.36] And you go out there and make like a less supreme experience because you just want to be able
[1798.36 → 1801.38] to do this kind of test, see if it's better for the customers, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1801.38 → 1804.30] You get it out there, and we know every single time what happens.
[1804.72 → 1805.06] All right.
[1805.12 → 1807.04] Well, we are going to go on to the next A-B test.
[1807.12 → 1808.10] We're just going to put that in production.
[1808.20 → 1809.22] No need to productionize it.
[1809.30 → 1810.88] We'll just let you let it go as is.
[1810.98 → 1812.26] And boom, you're off to the next one.
[1812.38 → 1812.74] Classic.
[1813.30 → 1818.52] All of your crappy ideas caught 4K cinema out there.
[1819.50 → 1821.20] And you move on to the next A-B test.
[1822.12 → 1822.68] It's true.
[1823.02 → 1823.66] Just move right on.
[1823.66 → 1824.08] What happens?
[1824.70 → 1831.08] When I was at Epic, there was a bunch of like a serious amount of code that was still unchanged
[1831.08 → 1833.18] from like the 70s or something.
[1833.18 → 1838.08] Like, I don't remember how long ago it was, but it still had Judy Faulkner at the top CEO.
[1838.84 → 1843.18] She wrote some stuff, and you're like, dang, that's crazy.
[1843.36 → 1844.00] In Cobol.
[1844.74 → 1846.02] Well, it was in Mumps.
[1846.38 → 1847.04] Mumps, right.
[1847.30 → 1847.62] Oh, yeah.
[1847.78 → 1848.14] Mumps.
[1848.84 → 1853.18] Let's say the coding style looked a lot different in those from like the 70s or 80s.
[1853.66 → 1856.64] They had developed some conventions that fix.
[1856.78 → 1859.38] But it was like, whoa, that is insane.
[1859.44 → 1862.30] You just stumble on it and like unchanged forever.
[1862.40 → 1863.52] Like, I'm closing this file.
[1863.60 → 1865.34] I don't even want to have access to this.
[1865.60 → 1865.80] I don't.
[1866.52 → 1868.64] This is load bearing for real.
[1871.20 → 1871.86] Oh, man.
[1871.90 → 1875.92] Because if there's been a bug there, there are countless customers that are relying on that
[1875.92 → 1876.82] bug to exist.
[1877.04 → 1880.56] Like, there are billions of dollars residing on that bug.
[1880.66 → 1882.40] You do not fix or touch this.
[1882.40 → 1886.52] You close your editor and walk away for a little bit if you accidentally end up in there.
[1888.20 → 1888.70] That's funny.
[1888.78 → 1892.14] I've had a very similar thing happen where I was chasing down a bug for Computers Unlimited
[1892.14 → 1896.22] back in the day, which then later became known as Total Information Management System, which
[1896.22 → 1900.00] is like how a bunch of industrial medicals, like planning for equipment and shipment of,
[1900.08 → 1902.20] you know, auction tanks and all that.
[1902.46 → 1903.38] And it's just like, oh, yeah.
[1903.46 → 1903.66] Yeah.
[1903.72 → 1904.06] Beast Code.
[1904.18 → 1904.94] Beast Code worked there.
[1904.94 → 1909.88] And one of them, it was just like, oh, I have to go into Synergy Land.
[1910.04 → 1910.82] Oh, what's Synergy?
[1911.08 → 1912.76] And it's just like this whole other language.
[1913.12 → 1914.82] It is old as me.
[1914.94 → 1915.88] It's like old as dirt.
[1915.92 → 1917.20] And I'm just like, I can't touch this language.
[1917.34 → 1917.58] I refuse.
[1917.72 → 1920.16] Like, this is, if I touch this, I'm breaking everybody.
[1920.52 → 1921.52] I don't know how to test it.
[1921.84 → 1923.84] I don't know what the I don't know what the outcomes are.
[1923.84 → 1925.14] I don't know who's relying on this.
[1925.48 → 1929.18] I'm like 22 years old, and they're like, just fix this bug from the 80s.
[1929.18 → 1930.46] And I'm like, no, I'm not touching it.
[1932.46 → 1934.84] I did a terrible one at Rad Game Tools.
[1935.40 → 1943.26] Like, definitely the worst thing I've ever done in my career by far is, so we didn't
[1943.26 → 1949.06] have like a build system of any kind because back then there was like only like GNU Make
[1949.06 → 1951.78] or Visual Studios like built in one.
[1951.78 → 1955.08] There was not much for cross-platform build things at all.
[1955.72 → 1958.08] So I'm like, okay, cool.
[1958.14 → 1961.22] We got to get this stuff running on like Mac as well and things like that.
[1961.24 → 1965.80] So I'm like, I'm going to make a build utility like this famous worst decisions of all time.
[1967.18 → 1975.28] So I make this build utility called CEP, and it is like this, it is absolute garbage.
[1975.28 → 1980.36] Like it's basically like it, it has one really kind of cool idea.
[1980.36 → 1985.44] Like I liked the idea of it, which is that you don't write separate build things.
[1985.80 → 1992.24] Just the it reads the comments of your source code and that is how it does the build.
[1992.78 → 1993.52] So sweet.
[1993.52 → 1995.00] Sweet.
[1995.60 → 1997.18] He doesn't know Tom's a genius.
[1997.34 → 1997.58] Okay.
[1997.60 → 1998.52] He doesn't know Tom's a genius.
[1998.52 → 1998.84] Sorry.
[1998.98 → 2003.26] We'll go over, we should go over Tom's a genius in a separate standup episode.
[2003.48 → 2003.72] Okay.
[2003.94 → 2005.66] I was going to ask who Tom's a genius.
[2005.66 → 2005.84] Yeah.
[2005.84 → 2008.76] It's too long, but we will do a full episode on Tom's a genius.
[2009.06 → 2009.52] Next week.
[2009.88 → 2010.04] Yeah.
[2010.10 → 2010.76] As slides.
[2011.00 → 2011.20] Yes.
[2011.40 → 2011.72] As slides.
[2011.72 → 2013.22] So I'm just like, this is great.
[2013.32 → 2014.82] So like, here's how it's going to work.
[2014.90 → 2017.62] Cause, and again, all of this stuff is like fairly new at the time.
[2017.64 → 2019.86] So the things I'm saying are not de rigueur at this time.
[2019.92 → 2022.52] I'm thinking these are like really cool, like innovative things.
[2023.32 → 2025.86] It's going to, you're just going to point it at one C file.
[2026.66 → 2028.20] It's going to spider out from there.
[2028.24 → 2029.70] It's just going to like parse the includes.
[2029.70 → 2031.76] It's going to figure out all the things that it should depend on.
[2031.82 → 2032.30] It's just going to do it.
[2032.40 → 2033.36] So you don't have to make, make files.
[2033.40 → 2034.22] You don't have to list the dependencies.
[2034.34 → 2035.42] You're just going to point at this thing and go.
[2035.78 → 2039.42] And if you need any kind of build stuff, you just put it in the comments, right?
[2039.42 → 2042.34] In the comment, you just say like, here's the build parameters I want.
[2042.92 → 2043.78] It sounds nice.
[2043.92 → 2046.04] Like, I mean, that does, that is like a, you know, theoretically.
[2046.04 → 2046.22] Right.
[2046.22 → 2049.88] And if you don't know yet, if you don't know what the hell you're doing, you're like,
[2049.90 → 2050.68] this is going to be great.
[2050.92 → 2051.08] Right.
[2051.54 → 2051.72] Yeah.
[2051.72 → 2053.14] I still think it could be great, Casey.
[2053.82 → 2054.18] Yeah.
[2054.18 → 2059.08] Well, you and, you and me when I was 22 or whatever it was.
[2060.26 → 2060.58] Anyway.
[2060.58 → 2067.92] So I write this thing and I don't know anything about how to do the like, like it, I don't
[2067.92 → 2068.72] really think it through.
[2068.72 → 2071.40] I do, I'm not good enough to like figure out how to do it well.
[2071.64 → 2077.02] So really what it ends up being is sort of like just a string replacement kind of language.
[2077.24 → 2084.24] So you like, you can define stuff in this, like in your comments, you can define something
[2084.24 → 2089.60] and really all that's going to do is just replace that thing with whatever you defined
[2089.60 → 2090.12] it to be.
[2090.30 → 2092.72] That's all it's, that's all it could do.
[2092.80 → 2095.88] And it does this by like literally string rewriting.
[2095.88 → 2101.60] So all it is like, if you said like Foo is now this crap, then anytime it sees Foo
[2101.60 → 2103.94] in the things that's doing, it just replaces it with that.
[2104.18 → 2104.76] And that's it.
[2104.86 → 2106.66] You get, there's no, there's nothing else.
[2106.70 → 2108.16] It doesn't have anything else.
[2108.16 → 2113.88] And the to the extent that it has conditionals at all, they're just like, it won't rewrite
[2113.88 → 2114.44] the thing.
[2114.68 → 2115.34] That's it.
[2115.54 → 2115.82] Right.
[2116.02 → 2119.04] So you reinvented pre-processor macros?
[2119.58 → 2119.96] Yeah.
[2120.08 → 2122.04] I'd say it's pre-processor macros at build time.
[2122.16 → 2123.06] That's what it was.
[2123.16 → 2124.46] It's pre-processor macros at build time.
[2124.80 → 2125.36] That's what it was.
[2126.24 → 2126.76] Nice.
[2126.76 → 2129.26] So this thing is a tremendous pile of garbage.
[2129.44 → 2130.30] It's horrid.
[2130.44 → 2130.64] Right.
[2130.80 → 2133.28] And the worst part is it's the worst kind of horrid.
[2133.42 → 2136.68] It's the kind of horrid that seems good at first.
[2136.72 → 2137.12] Right.
[2137.16 → 2140.86] Because you're like the first time you point this thing at like a C program, and it builds
[2140.86 → 2142.54] the whole thing and the dependencies all work.
[2142.64 → 2144.64] And so you're like, oh my God, this is amazing.
[2144.86 → 2148.46] I just like revolutionized the build process for the world.
[2149.24 → 2150.24] I'm amazing.
[2150.38 → 2150.70] Right.
[2150.70 → 2155.68] And you don't realize that actually what you did is just fucking destroy like everyone's
[2155.68 → 2159.52] attempt to build things at this company for the next like 30 years.
[2160.54 → 2161.02] Okay.
[2162.60 → 2164.34] So that I do that.
[2164.60 → 2169.84] And Jeff Roberts, who's the guy who runs rad game tools, excellent programmer, excellent,
[2169.94 → 2170.64] excellent programmer.
[2171.94 → 2173.44] He goes like, oh, cool.
[2173.50 → 2173.78] Okay.
[2173.82 → 2176.06] So someone made this like little build utility.
[2176.34 → 2177.02] That's great.
[2177.02 → 2179.88] I can now start modifying it to do what I want.
[2179.88 → 2183.68] And what Jeff wants is always for things to run very efficiently.
[2184.12 → 2185.28] That's what he wants.
[2185.82 → 2192.36] So he adds like multi threading, like running, distributing it on cores, all this stuff.
[2192.48 → 2198.06] He optimizes like the, the things that run faster all the while, no core improvements
[2198.06 → 2200.42] to this thing because it's still just a string replacement thing.
[2201.42 → 2206.88] Rad ships on dozens of platforms, more platforms than any company I've ever seen.
[2207.20 → 2208.66] It ships on everything.
[2208.66 → 2214.26] Like, you know, it's like it from like Game Boy Colour to like, you know, Amazon's, you know,
[2214.36 → 2216.10] special arm server deployment.
[2216.26 → 2217.30] They run on everything.
[2217.96 → 2222.26] So he builds this giant, like all the builds scripts and stuff.
[2222.36 → 2224.86] He builds all like the compile time settings, all that stuff.
[2225.16 → 2229.00] There's like tens of thousands of lines of C dep code.
[2229.00 → 2233.58] By the time he's done with it after several years, it builds all the stuff for like, for
[2233.58 → 2234.80] the video depressor, all that stuff.
[2235.90 → 2242.86] Now, to this day, I am told the rad builds still run on C dep.
[2242.86 → 2245.98] It is debuggable.
[2246.46 → 2249.42] It is completely unreadable.
[2250.46 → 2256.10] It's huge amounts of institutional knowledge that Jeff has built up to build on every platform
[2256.10 → 2258.34] known to mankind and to distribute the builds.
[2258.54 → 2260.52] It is so insane.
[2260.52 → 2267.04] So like, literally, I don't know what to say other than like, I have created so much pain
[2267.04 → 2271.50] and suffering for that company just by creating this, this fricking terrible utility.
[2271.68 → 2275.46] If I had just done a better job on that, it would have saved.
[2275.70 → 2278.86] I don't even want to know how many hours people have lost spending to trying to figure out why
[2278.86 → 2281.12] their builds don't work because of this piece of junk.
[2281.12 → 2284.24] Is the dep and C dep short for depressed?
[2285.02 → 2285.66] It should be.
[2286.48 → 2287.42] It should be.
[2287.90 → 2290.30] Casey, you truly sound like a 10x engineer.
[2290.62 → 2294.00] The truest 10x engineer makes 10x more work for everybody else.
[2294.14 → 2295.28] That's what, and that is what I did.
[2295.58 → 2295.80] Yeah.
[2295.98 → 2301.28] Because just not literally the not having this tool would have been much better.
[2301.66 → 2301.84] Yeah.
[2301.94 → 2302.14] Right.
[2302.34 → 2307.68] Because then Jeff would have like made when if, if he ever did all of that work, he would
[2307.68 → 2310.22] have made it in something much less crappy.
[2310.22 → 2314.74] Like he would have just opened up a C file and made his own little build utility that
[2314.74 → 2315.68] wouldn't have sucked.
[2315.78 → 2315.96] Right.
[2316.04 → 2321.62] So it's like, it's like I basically took all of this other work that was actually useful
[2321.62 → 2329.08] and I made it suck by having it start with something awful that it never got rid of.
[2329.08 → 2329.36] Right.
[2330.20 → 2335.40] And multiple people have had to come on and like fix crap, like, or try desperately, but
[2335.40 → 2340.20] they, there's only so much they can do because now there's this huge unpayable,
[2340.22 → 2345.44] gigantic, like, you know, tens of thousands of lines of build knowledge about like, how
[2345.44 → 2352.52] do you properly do an annotated debug build of a Game Cube binary from like, you know, the
[2352.52 → 2354.76] year 2001 or something like that.
[2354.78 → 2355.04] Right.
[2355.44 → 2358.08] And so that, and no one wants to fix that.
[2358.16 → 2359.32] No one's going to rewrite that.
[2359.78 → 2359.96] Yeah.
[2359.96 → 2363.90] So I basically ruined, I ruined that entire, like, it was awful.
[2364.14 → 2364.70] It was terrible.
[2365.34 → 2370.44] Casey, I just wanted to say this will make a lot more sense after Prime does his Tom talk,
[2370.52 → 2372.54] but we just got to say Casey is a genius.
[2373.24 → 2374.92] Casey is a genius.
[2375.36 → 2375.58] Yeah.
[2375.78 → 2375.88] I agree.
[2376.66 → 2378.40] That was a real, that was a real genius move.
[2378.68 → 2379.76] That is a real genius move.
[2380.18 → 2381.06] Um, okay.
[2381.10 → 2383.24] Hey TJ or Hey Josh, we need to put this in the beginning.
[2383.40 → 2387.26] TJ, where do we find, because obviously this is the extended, by the way, it's not, it's
[2387.26 → 2388.90] not Jay, it's not Jay Diesel anymore.
[2389.52 → 2391.56] It's obviously Jay Juratory.
[2391.78 → 2397.46] Uh, so trust me, it'll all make sense here in a moment, Casey, when you learn about Jay
[2397.46 → 2397.70] Diesel.
[2397.82 → 2401.70] It's Federal Juratory domain specific language.
[2402.50 → 2403.28] I love it.
[2403.28 → 2403.54] Oh God.
[2403.60 → 2403.80] Yeah.
[2403.92 → 2404.10] Yeah.
[2404.36 → 2404.80] Federal.
[2406.16 → 2406.56] Federal.
[2407.16 → 2408.02] So, uh, TJ, where can people find.
[2408.02 → 2408.96] Can we call it a Diesel?
[2409.10 → 2412.12] Can we call it a domain inappropriate language or DIL?
[2412.22 → 2412.76] It's a DIL.
[2412.84 → 2414.28] A domain inappropriate language.
[2414.28 → 2419.84] If you enjoy this podcast, check us out on Spotify, the standup also on Apple podcast.
[2419.96 → 2423.44] Personally, I can't find it on Apple podcast, but I've been told we have one there.
[2423.50 → 2424.92] It will be linked in the description.
[2425.58 → 2429.30] Uh, the name is Casey computer enhanced.com trash.
[2429.44 → 2433.42] He works at Netflix, by the way, TJ streams, by the way, the primo gen.
[2433.42 → 2434.88] Thank you for watching the standup.
