• Jira bought two browsers
• Discussion about Asian and their tools, including Bit Keeper and Confluence
• Criticism of Confluence as a wiki tool that cannot be searched effectively
• Introduction to Blacksmith as a sponsor, which optimizes GitHub Actions workflows
• Mention of Atlassian (owner of Jira) being the "Frito-Lay" of enterprise software due to their numerous acquisitions and products
• Atlassian acquired a browser company that created a chromium fork called Arc
• The browser was praised for its unique features, but failed to gain significant market share
• Atlassian pivoted the company's focus to AI, despite some skepticism about the decision
• The acquisition and pivot were compared to Google's purchase of Windward (later rebranded as Figma), with similarities in terms of both acquisitions being high-profile and expensive
• The company Atlassian was bought for $6.1 billion with its browser, DIA
• The browser DIA was a failure and had to be rolled back due to being too advanced for users
• The buyer of Atlassian wants an all-cash offer rather than stock
• The reason for the cash offer is speculated to be that Atlassian has investors who need to be paid back
• Atlassian's product Jira is universally hated by its users but is still a successful and profitable company
• Enterprise software often prioritizes manager happiness over employee satisfaction, resulting in products like Jira
• Building successful enterprise software requires compromising on quality to please managers
• A project is nearing completion, and a return on investment strategy is being considered
• The speaker discusses an AI prediction model based on if-then statements and compares it to Jira
• Knowledge workers are mentioned, and the speaker pokes fun at the idea of one billion knowledge workers worldwide
• Trello is discussed as a kanban board for tasks, and its relationship with Atlassian's Jira is explored
• The browser company's acquisition by Atlassian is seen as a negative development, potentially ruining their "artsy" image
• Difficulty with web architecture
• Dislike for switching browsers
• Alternative ways to access the internet (SSH, WSL)
• Discussion about coffee and its flavour/quality
• Limited-time availability of coffee in the shop
• Confusion over SSH commands and file transfer
• SCP (Secure Copy) command explained
• Critique of Jira's handling of a situation
• Discussion about AI and its impact on coding (Too Much AI)
• Statistics on daily code written at Coinbase, mostly generated by AI
• Concerns about AI-generated code quality and security on platforms like Coinbase
• Comparison of old code vs. AI-generated code, with some suggesting that the latter is not significantly better
• Discussion about the potential for widespread adoption of AI coding leading to lower standards
• Reference to a supposed "Fort Knox" audit and the notion that the gold inside Fort Knox was actually used in microchips
• Debate on whether AI can fully replace human coders, with some arguing its possible but others expressing concerns
• Personal anecdotes about using AI tools for coding tasks, including testing and refactoring
• Criticism of measuring AI productivity by lines of code written
• Importance of evaluating software developers based on features and efficiency, not just quantity of code
• Concerns about AI increasing entropy in systems instead of reducing it
• Desire to see more practical applications of AI, such as reducing codebase size or finding patterns in code
• Difficulty in training AI to recognize and replicate complex human patterns in code
• Disappointment with current state of AI development, citing lack of meaningful progress and poor performance
• The importance of having AI tools that can draw human-like code fairly reliably
• Current limitations and problems with using AI for coding, such as over-reliance on poorly written code
• Need for better training data and adversarial training processes to improve AI's ability to learn from real examples
• Potential for AI to become a "boutique" service where developers can use licensed versions of pre-trained models
• Idea of having a personalized AI coding assistant, such as a virtual "buddy" like Clippy
• Computers are not fast enough for current AI demands, causing performance issues and slowing down processing.
• Security is a major concern with increased code lines leading to more exploits.
• Electricity generation and consumption are problematic, particularly for data centres, with many using fossil fuels and contributing to environmental concerns. 
• The current model of AI development perpetuates perverse incentives for companies to prioritize token usage over concise coding.
• Discussion about data centres, specifically current vs AI-specific data centres
• AI data centres are specialized for low-precision matrix multiplies, not general-purpose computing
• High power consumption of AI data centres due to liquid cooling and sustained high load requirements
• Concerns about infrastructure waste if AI becomes obsolete or less efficient
• Contrast between general-purpose computing and hyper-specialized data centres
