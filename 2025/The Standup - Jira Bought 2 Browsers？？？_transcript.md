[0.00 --> 4.60]  all right are you guys ready for this oh no but i am so ready dude
[4.60 --> 12.56]  i'm so ready right now okay you don't even know how much podcast i'm ready for
[12.56 --> 24.76]  uh anyway sorry go go all right let's do it go welcome to the stand up live every wednesday
[24.76 --> 30.68]  and friday at 11 a.m the lord's time 10 p or 10 a.m pacific standard time if you're in the valley
[30.68 --> 38.44]  13 a.m crazy time third yes jose did go or jose did go can we meet at 13 a.m and i was like
[38.44 --> 43.74]  i got this i know i know what you're talking about all right back on topic today we are doing
[43.74 --> 50.56]  jira bought a browser unironically yesterday jira can i say yeah i'm gonna technically and actually
[50.56 --> 56.32]  you right now they bought two browsers oh true mm-hmm they did well they bought one company
[56.32 --> 65.14]  okay two browsers yeah tell them try tell them okay so this is more okay so the reason why i want to
[65.14 --> 71.50]  bring this up isn't because i think this topic is the single most interesting topic i just want to
[71.50 --> 75.98]  see casey get confused like that's actually my primary reason for bringing this this one up to
[75.98 --> 81.08]  the stand up oh he's which is all right so yesterday at lazian uh casey are you familiar
[81.08 --> 87.62]  with lazian and some of the wonderful tools they have created no i do i have heard of them vaguely
[87.62 --> 96.58]  i am like vaguely aware right i know they do some like git like thing uh trash i think before had
[96.58 --> 101.30]  said it was bitbucket which if i remember correctly was like a pre like that was before git that's what
[101.30 --> 109.28]  they used before uh they stiffed linus on it right that was like bit bit enforcer bit warden or bit
[109.28 --> 114.48]  something okay it was something different bucket it's one of those man no no no at lazian owns bit
[114.48 --> 121.64]  bucket that became stash oh yeah we use that i think what was the there so originally way way back when
[121.64 --> 130.82]  before all y'alls was born the the kernel team for like so so linus like started using this
[130.82 --> 137.12]  the tech tips guy no yes the linus tech tips the guy who wrote the linux operating system
[137.12 --> 143.04]  i'm not gonna lie used to mix those two up all the time bitkeeper casey it's bitkeeper okay and it
[143.04 --> 149.00]  wasn't it wasn't linus that did that it's somebody on linux team broke the uh terms of service with
[149.00 --> 154.58]  bitkeeper and reverse engineered their protocol and they said they wouldn't and that's what caused
[154.58 --> 159.24]  them to have to switch because then they were getting dropped i just meant the then that's what made
[159.24 --> 163.80]  linus right git right is they were like all right i guess we're we got to do our own thing now that
[163.80 --> 170.30]  was the only thing i remember okay so that was bitkeeper so that means i literally have no idea what
[170.30 --> 176.94]  this company does i knew i i knew they did some kind of like git like thing i have no idea never touched
[176.94 --> 184.00]  it there's gonna be a confluence of feature go for it no tj has to go dang it dang it trash
[184.00 --> 192.54]  it was so good trash josh run it back for me i never said anything use ai to make this work josh
[192.54 --> 199.14]  there's gonna be a confluence of features like you've never seen before something like that i don't
[199.14 --> 205.80]  remember what i was gonna say because i got too mad hey jay casey yeah you're gonna have a confluence
[205.80 --> 216.00]  of trello ticketing yes okay so casey they make confluence which is like the world's worst wiki
[216.00 --> 222.10]  so if you're not familiar with like wikis somehow confluence it confluence is the only known
[222.10 --> 228.78]  like product that you cannot search with that is meant to be for searching for documents for teams to
[228.78 --> 234.98]  use except in the search bar autocomplete search bar autocomplete anybody please type one in chat
[234.98 --> 240.90]  to say it in the youtube comments right now the autocomplete is the best search of all time and
[240.90 --> 245.36]  then everything else about confluence you cannot use at all it's just that it's just absolutely
[245.36 --> 252.12]  garbage it is crazy whether you're a vibe coder or a handcrafted free-range neo vim user you still
[252.12 --> 257.64]  need ci to be able to build your binaries run your tests or make your releases that's where blacksmith
[257.64 --> 262.70]  comes in it takes your github actions and with a one-line change makes them faster and more cost
[262.70 --> 267.92]  effective not only that but you can finally get visibility into your ci pipeline right when things
[267.92 --> 272.38]  go wrong we're happy to have them as our sponsor for this episode because just like us this one is
[272.38 --> 277.52]  truly a no-brainer sign up and enjoy faster github action workflows at a much lower price blacksmith
[277.52 --> 283.88]  twice the speed and up to 75 reduction in costs check them out at blacksmith.sh now back to the
[283.88 --> 290.48]  stand-up everything's i heard um i heard after elon bought x the entire search team went over to
[290.48 --> 295.62]  confluence that's what i that's what i heard confluence search is worse than is worse than
[295.62 --> 300.50]  twitter like it is actually worse it's objectively worse you didn't think it was possible but it's
[300.50 --> 304.82]  worse they they managed to figure out how to make something that shows none of the words you type in
[305.46 --> 311.24]  okay so you know you know everything you love about corporate enterprise culture and software
[311.24 --> 317.68]  so it turns out you know how like frito-lay owns every snack you find in the grocery store like
[317.68 --> 324.88]  even if there's seven different ones atlassian is the frito-lay of enterprise software you're like oh my
[324.88 --> 331.26]  goodness i can't believe that they're taking 17 minutes to load up this custom page with 37 different
[331.26 --> 337.38]  tags for every single ticket that they have with story points and t-shirt sizes and everybody has 13 ways
[337.38 --> 342.14]  to interact with the ticket that thing is also made by the same people that can't figure out how to
[342.14 --> 349.68]  search text in your wiki same people makes sense to make sense also do a stash which stash is actually
[349.68 --> 358.02]  the objectively worst version of github which i know that is shocking for now for now so since they had
[358.02 --> 362.54]  nothing to do with bitkeeper which is the only thing i actually vaguely knew because we looked at it
[362.54 --> 371.34]  briefly at rad at the time way back when before git existed so bitbucket which i guess is now stash
[371.34 --> 376.60]  is what exactly are they literally just running git with the front end on top of it or what is it
[376.60 --> 382.70]  it's just imagine github for corporations private hosted github for corporations isn't github also for
[382.70 --> 388.76]  corporations this was before and plus you could own it so it's not like it's it's like self-hosted
[388.76 --> 393.54]  that's one of the big differences that you can self hope you can commercially self-host your version
[393.54 --> 398.44]  of it so that way you own everything whereas github's like we own everything you get to say you
[398.44 --> 403.58]  have you get your own little slice on our stuff right we won't show it to anyone else except us
[403.58 --> 408.90]  yeah except for copilot copilot will love your stuff yeah dude and anyone in our company who wants to
[408.90 --> 413.66]  look at it you can self-host github okay well this was at one point you couldn't that's you know this
[413.66 --> 418.78]  thing but what are you saying trash all right we're getting distracted well teach brought off
[418.78 --> 425.78]  frito-lay so i google what frito-lay owns that they make all my favorite chips which are sun chips
[425.78 --> 433.30]  okay all right ruffles someone clip food white cheddar popcorn yep that's a good one cheetos
[433.30 --> 438.72]  tortitos salsa were you about to say tortillas
[438.72 --> 443.48]  trash be honest it sounded like you were halfway to tortillas some fajitas and tortillas
[443.48 --> 448.72]  look if it's if it's a floatilla it's a tortillas they're spelled the same way
[449.38 --> 452.82]  i'm chicken vagina on a tortilla please
[452.82 --> 461.46]  delicious okay so that is what atlasian is they've always built developer productivity
[461.46 --> 467.32]  very heavy air quotes on the word productivity tools right but it's always been enterprise focus
[467.32 --> 476.56]  productivity and yesterday the ceo drops a two minute video on why they acquired a browser
[476.56 --> 481.28]  okay and i'm going to give you the best quote i personally think of the video
[481.28 --> 487.54]  which is i already know some people use browsers to browse
[487.54 --> 491.80]  and whereas other people use browsers to work
[491.80 --> 504.68]  and that's why we spent 610 million dollars in an all cash offer to acquire this company with one
[504.68 --> 510.48]  product that people loved but they abandoned and a new ai one that all i can find is people who hate
[510.48 --> 517.20]  and hold on but okay so at first i thought holy cow they spent a lot of money cash cash on hand money
[517.20 --> 526.44]  to be able to buy this but then i realized windsurf which is a tertiary clone of of vs code sold for
[526.44 --> 532.28]  like three plus billion except it didn't right wasn't it more like they just took the people and
[532.28 --> 537.70]  literally left windsurf with the company google google did that but then devon bought the rest
[537.70 --> 542.76]  so google got the google got one part of it and devon got the other part google took the parents
[542.76 --> 549.36]  two christmas now yeah they have two christmas that windsurf very confusing so here's what i would
[549.36 --> 557.56]  would like to know if if i may ask in this particular case based on everything you said about this
[557.56 --> 563.72]  company who cannot implement tech search properly i'm guessing they did not actually write a browser
[563.72 --> 570.82]  so is this just like we re-skinned you know web we gotta back up casey we gotta back up sorry we
[570.82 --> 576.80]  atlassian is the parent company that purchased the browser company so the browser company
[576.80 --> 581.52]  browser company of new york browser company of new york true which obviously the browser company of
[581.52 --> 589.34]  somewhere else can i say i i do want to say that's a pretty sick name yeah i actually think of all the
[589.34 --> 595.40]  things that they made their name is the coolest okay so i could do browser company of california and
[595.40 --> 601.44]  you could trash unless it's taken that's kind of google's thing but maybe you could maybe yeah i'm
[601.44 --> 604.68]  thinking you could be you could be the other browser company
[604.68 --> 614.28]  uh but but can you just it's a chromium fork so they made a chromium fork first in this is this they
[614.28 --> 619.00]  made arc arc was this browser that was like a chromium fork but they did a lot more stuff than like
[619.00 --> 623.90]  normal for these chromium forks they wrote like their own whole like ui kit thing and all this
[623.90 --> 628.94]  other so that you could do a bunch of stuff that was not possible to do before in a chromium fork
[628.94 --> 633.50]  they like move tabs around and let you do like tab groups and they took like everybody's favorite
[633.50 --> 639.52]  extensions and built it like faster and better in like a native way that was supposed to work better
[639.52 --> 644.92]  for everybody and people were like wow this browser is sick i love tabs on the side i'm gonna make
[644.92 --> 649.70]  that my whole personality is that i have tabs on the side of my browser and set on the top
[649.70 --> 654.28]  i'm so much cooler and better than you better it is it is objectively better to have thank you for
[654.28 --> 659.84]  proving my point and so then after they had that for a while they were not getting a lot of market
[659.84 --> 665.88]  share believe it or not not a lot of normies thought hmm tabs on the side is worth me figuring
[665.88 --> 672.92]  out what the heck browsers are uh so then they're like you know what we need to do casey can you guess
[672.92 --> 676.74]  what they needed to do after they didn't get market share yeah i mean they they did it like
[676.74 --> 683.70]  you said they did ai i'm sure yeah i mean that's obvious right ai pivot is like that you know just
[683.70 --> 692.10]  where i mean there's literally just the thing where it's like um it's like someone is dropping money
[692.10 --> 698.78]  out of out of the top of a building and there's all these like dudes with buckets running like i need
[698.78 --> 703.88]  to cash in on some like it's coming down on the ai side and they're all running over there hoping to
[703.88 --> 707.72]  catch some of it before they stop dumping the money out of the top i need to i need to catch some for
[707.72 --> 714.46]  real hey and trash are you tasting like a wave of nacho flavor over there or anything
[714.46 --> 721.06]  dude i just finished my bowl of cereal and i was like i'm still hungry so does anyone have a
[721.06 --> 725.48]  connection at frito-lay in the audience please if you're a youtube viewer later or you're in twitch chat
[725.48 --> 733.38]  right now true we at least half of the people in this call would chill frito-lay like none other
[733.38 --> 740.60]  on this podcast just throwing it out there for real okay so back to topic yep so literally somebody
[740.60 --> 747.84]  just spent 610 million dollars to buy a browser that because they put the tabs on the side
[747.84 --> 753.94]  so well here's the deal is they they built that browser so that was called arc but then of course
[753.94 --> 759.44]  as tj said no one used it so then they actually built a second one called dia awful and dia is
[759.44 --> 766.48]  supposed to be all yeah after these nuts that's what it's named for and apparently it was so heavily
[766.48 --> 771.02]  ai indifferent that they actually had to roll back some of it and kind of go a bit more traditional
[771.02 --> 775.00]  than they were originally going for on it because people just couldn't understand it at all
[775.00 --> 783.38]  and they had asian saw this browser and they said we'll give you 610 and you know what we need
[783.38 --> 789.06]  ai browser and that was the whole pitch of the two minute meeting oh just wait bram stop trash said he
[789.06 --> 794.56]  has a joke i got it i got a joke play it they had no idea what they were doing
[794.56 --> 811.82]  i i i'm actually missing the joke i have no idea what the joke is at all but i don't know what the
[811.82 --> 817.78]  software is either so the browser's called dia so i said they have no idea what they're doing
[817.78 --> 824.96]  are you kidding me did that just fly over everyone's head except for dude i couldn't
[824.96 --> 828.64]  help it because i was thinking of idea as an intelligent i was like trash it's a very different
[828.64 --> 835.86]  set of productivity trolls no chat got it trash chat is they all got it they were spam they get it
[836.50 --> 843.32]  man at least someone gets me dude i'm getting that into a short just for me and you i don't care
[843.32 --> 851.54]  no one else what or i guess i should say trash are you sure they didn't have a idea what they
[851.54 --> 859.20]  were doing oh man yeah they definitely had a couple ideas i can't i can't i don't even know
[859.20 --> 863.52]  i'm gone finish the sentence you got to think of something don't don't leave it hanging figure
[863.52 --> 872.24]  it out dude a idea that's pretty good uh okay look i just here's here's my first question among many
[872.24 --> 879.70]  yes my first question is what does it say about your company that the people you're buying are
[879.70 --> 886.18]  like we're gonna need an all cash offer for that they're like we don't want stock in whatever this
[886.18 --> 892.50]  thing is that you've got here because it looks dire like what does that say that it was an all cash
[892.50 --> 897.92]  offer my guess is so actually i i just assume that literally the browser company is just cash in the
[897.92 --> 901.96]  bag like that's what it says to me when you get an all cash offer is that you are just taking the
[901.96 --> 906.58]  money you have probably some contractual period that some amount of people have to work for for
[906.58 --> 910.20]  a heightened salary for some amount of time and the other people are just gonna be like
[910.20 --> 916.56]  and then do the disappearing thing but still it's like i kind of figured they had a bunch of investors
[916.56 --> 922.96]  they needed to pay back okay uh from from before i have no idea this is just pure speculation
[922.96 --> 928.10]  yeah if investors were like oh we can get a nice chunk of atlassian now they would have been like
[928.10 --> 934.10]  cool but here they're like nope we do not want that like don't don't be doing that to be fair
[934.10 --> 940.70]  atlassian is the only company i know that has built a product that is universally like hated and they're
[940.70 --> 948.02]  a billion dollar company like people hate jira yeah trash are a billion dollar company i'm so impressed
[948.02 --> 955.12]  that a company could make so many things that are so bad but be like number one and everything like
[955.12 --> 960.56]  it just it's like are you talking about microsoft again dude we're talking about it last time yeah
[960.56 --> 964.64]  yeah but dude like it's it's kind of crazy like when you just talk to the whole user base and
[964.64 --> 969.80]  they're just collectively against this company yeah but you know who likes enterprise that's what
[969.80 --> 975.24]  enterprise is about so the way enterprise managers love it the way enterprise software works
[975.24 --> 982.60]  is you make absolute dog poop so think salesforce or something right and then you have like a giant
[982.60 --> 989.84]  apparatus that goes out to someone's company and convinces upper level management that it's really
[989.84 --> 995.88]  useful and then they buy it and then all of your employees hate it that's that's enterprise software
[995.88 --> 1001.98]  that is what it is right this is like people who are using it don't actually get a say in the decision
[1001.98 --> 1007.88]  which is why it's so terrible yeah my buddy who works at like a food distribution place used to work
[1007.88 --> 1012.74]  in sales they had their own thing and then they moved to sap he literally was like i have to
[1012.74 --> 1019.76]  get out of here because all i do now is answer customer calls of where did our huge pallets of food go
[1019.76 --> 1025.60]  because they can't find them anymore they like lot they had lost so much stuff because they switched
[1025.60 --> 1033.24]  their inventory system because big companies use sap we're a big company now and then it's awful and this
[1033.24 --> 1037.86]  is the same with like all the like you know the hr software and the health insurance management and
[1037.86 --> 1043.38]  all that stuff it's just all like complete garbage but that's because that is not how it works like
[1043.38 --> 1049.18]  the people who actually use it have like no say right it's somebody who's like looking at like
[1049.18 --> 1055.20]  budgetary numbers and compliance issues and legal and all that stuff and they're just signing off on
[1055.20 --> 1060.80]  it and then everyone gets to suffer that's like what it is so it's not surprising because enterprise
[1060.80 --> 1065.24]  software just isn't about delivering quality software and never was as far as i can tell
[1065.24 --> 1072.52]  so to be fair i feel like if i were to try to build jira feature for feature i might end in a very
[1072.52 --> 1078.84]  similar place oh it's the same it's the same result for sure yeah right like if if i really had to build
[1078.84 --> 1084.48]  something that made every manager happy but it but tried to make every employee also happy i think i'd end
[1084.48 --> 1090.68]  up in the exact same spot where every employee hates it half the managers like it and i'm just like well
[1090.68 --> 1097.70]  i tried well i made a billion i made a billion dollars whatever it's it's trying to solve the
[1097.70 --> 1102.18]  like jira in particular is trying to solve the problem of when our project's going to be finished
[1102.18 --> 1109.56]  right well can't you just return just return rand mod that would be a more effective strategy
[1109.56 --> 1115.92]  yeah return rand mod two years or something and whatever comes back it's like that there you go
[1115.92 --> 1122.24]  this is her new ai prediction model a bunch of if statements so what do we think this browser is
[1122.24 --> 1125.82]  going to look like so i think like in the advertisement they say it's for like the worker
[1125.82 --> 1130.96]  right so we have a knowledge worker yeah we need a knowledge or agree with tab one billion of them too
[1130.96 --> 1136.42]  trash there's one billion knowledge workers worldwide yeah i don't even know where that number came from
[1136.42 --> 1141.44]  but sure i mean i saw i saw it i don't know how we derived that how many knowledge twerkers are there
[1141.44 --> 1148.70]  exactly exactly one and that's me the remaining billion the remaining billions do it right now
[1148.70 --> 1153.90]  you cannot come out with that and not this is a family friendly show you will not get trash
[1153.90 --> 1156.22]  we'll save that for cron digital
[1156.22 --> 1161.70]  anyways go ahead trash sorry you were asking about knowledge workers
[1161.70 --> 1166.94]  yeah but yeah so they're obviously it sounds like uh their sales pitch was like you have a lot of tabs
[1166.94 --> 1172.06]  so like confluence trello god forbid you use trello anyone that uses trello
[1172.06 --> 1176.98]  okay what is trello can you guys tell me what the hell trello is this by the same company
[1176.98 --> 1179.44]  trello is jira but with color crayons
[1179.44 --> 1181.92]  but is it the same company or is it a different company
[1181.92 --> 1187.88]  it's owned by atlassian as well and it's a kanban board that's it it's just a drag and drop
[1187.88 --> 1194.98]  tasks between places so what okay so are you supposed to if you are a proper enterprise doing serious
[1194.98 --> 1201.30]  development no are you supposed to have jira and trello or you just have one or the other
[1201.30 --> 1207.68]  trello is trello is for side projects and startups but not anymore because they got bought by atlassian
[1207.68 --> 1213.78]  so now it's like lame isn't it linear or whatever is like the new that's the alternative to jira right
[1213.78 --> 1219.66]  oh my god yeah it's the new computer yes okay it's so this is the for me i feel like this is kind of
[1219.66 --> 1226.40]  the funniest thing because everybody i know who liked browsers made by the browser company
[1226.40 --> 1236.46]  liked it i'm gonna just say it here's my hot take 97.3 percent of the reason they liked it was
[1236.46 --> 1243.98]  because they had cool promotional videos that made you feel like a cool person and now they're owned
[1243.98 --> 1252.82]  by atlassian your artsy hipster browser is owned by the universally hated enterprise company how can
[1252.82 --> 1257.56]  you get a good product they're gonna get chewed up and spat out by the jira machine like it doesn't
[1257.56 --> 1264.40]  make any sense just go to that to be fair when when they did so so jira did do a two minute ish video
[1264.40 --> 1268.86]  kind of saying why they bought it and how they're gonna use ai and we have too many tabs and all
[1268.86 --> 1273.74]  that the browser company did an 18 second video where just like looked at some leaves
[1273.74 --> 1280.90]  and a little mouse came up it just clicked twice and it just said like coming soon or something
[1280.90 --> 1290.04]  that's what i'm saying all of their videos are like so when we did terminal.shop launch week we
[1290.04 --> 1295.74]  parodied like what they did intentionally as like a meme and tried to take ourselves as seriously as
[1295.74 --> 1301.34]  they could i think we still didn't reach that level like i still couldn't take myself as seriously in a
[1301.34 --> 1306.58]  parody as they did so it's like i don't know how getting acquired by atlassian is gonna go over
[1306.58 --> 1312.06]  with their audience base it would be like your favorite local coffee shop gets bought up by starbucks
[1312.06 --> 1317.34]  and like we're still gonna be independent yeah guys we're still just a small coffee shop fighting
[1317.34 --> 1322.72]  against the man i did take the browser company of new york is now wearing like a full like three
[1322.72 --> 1327.80]  piece suit like kind of thing from yes from wall street and they're sitting in greenwich village and
[1327.80 --> 1332.86]  you're just like guys you're not the curly mustache and the bow tie now they have the suit on and all
[1332.86 --> 1338.46]  that they're they're not the hipsters anymore yeah okay right and so that part is i don't know how
[1338.46 --> 1344.26]  that's gonna go over as for everybody's reaction who i knew used arc before that a lot of them left when
[1344.26 --> 1350.14]  the the deez nuts scenario happened right like they were all like my artsy browser it's gone
[1350.14 --> 1358.24]  serious question do you all actually switch browsers ever i did switch to zen eventually just to try it
[1358.24 --> 1363.10]  out the side tabs i wanted to see where the side tabs and again i said like is it good did you did
[1363.10 --> 1367.44]  did you find i actually really my actually favorite part is the essentials you actually have like three
[1367.44 --> 1371.86]  different levels of things you can say as like super important sort of important and then just
[1371.86 --> 1377.30]  everything else and like that's been pretty useful okay that's funny because like i just
[1377.30 --> 1381.88]  been using the same setup for years i just see all these people like switching to this and this and
[1381.88 --> 1385.88]  then they ultimately come back to where i was and i'm just like casey what browser are you using that's
[1385.88 --> 1392.40]  what i want to know yeah casey microsoft edge uh currently brave but not for any real reason other
[1392.40 --> 1398.40]  than i just wanted a chromium based browser because firefox kind of tanked like it doesn't really firefox
[1398.40 --> 1404.72]  like barely runs anymore it's like it's kind of questionable so firefox is actually awful firefox
[1404.72 --> 1410.60]  i'm using zen zen is firefox based it is awful it's pretty bad now and i don't expect it to get much
[1410.60 --> 1416.80]  better so i just i don't know like i use browsers begrudgingly obviously and i don't really have to use
[1416.80 --> 1424.32]  them for much actual like work except that now that i do have a website that i have to maintain
[1424.32 --> 1428.86]  it's more work like so i actually do unfortunately spend more time in browsers than i would like
[1428.86 --> 1433.76]  uh so if there was like some really amazing browser that'd be great but the problem with browsers is
[1433.76 --> 1438.04]  usually not the browser it's the web architecture so i don't really see how switching a web browser
[1438.04 --> 1443.68]  is really going to help much uh you know i i don't see it being something that's going to be useful
[1443.68 --> 1449.42]  long term putting like some kind of random you know sprinkling of fairy dust over the top of
[1449.42 --> 1455.30]  of the same underlying engine is not going to solve any problems that i have really yeah it's
[1455.30 --> 1460.64]  almost as if i wish i could order something through ssh right it's true if only there was an alternative
[1460.64 --> 1467.50]  way in which the internet could be bad where is your bag i don't have it order coffee via wsl you
[1467.50 --> 1473.26]  didn't get it yet no he did do i need to do wsl and then ssh and then order coffee yes i saved this
[1473.26 --> 1478.92]  i don't have open i don't have one oh someone else's picture oh what you still haven't gotten
[1478.92 --> 1484.86]  yours no was i supposed to get one yes 100 unless you lied to me and you said you signed up for cron
[1484.86 --> 1491.70]  for no reason and then you didn't do it i actually did not okay i completely forgot i completely forgot
[1491.70 --> 1494.14]  i will do it casey check this out
[1494.14 --> 1501.32]  uh yes really close to the camera when i get mine i'm not even gonna open it i'm just gonna
[1501.32 --> 1505.14]  put it in my office trash i'll send you i'll send you some more here's a question for you
[1505.14 --> 1515.28]  we are making fun of trash because he did unhashtag ads ad ad just in case uh you know i don't i don't
[1515.28 --> 1521.42]  want to be mistaken about any of this could you tell me something about like the flavor and quality of
[1521.42 --> 1526.50]  this coffee since i can't myself experience it right now just to be clear this is for
[1526.50 --> 1531.36]  entertainment purposes only and does not constitute an advertisement i just want that to be clear
[1531.36 --> 1538.00]  before we do this uh because somebody on here got themselves in a little hot water on x.com the
[1538.00 --> 1547.12]  application uh this one is a medium blend from papa new guinea okay it's not just any coffee not just
[1547.12 --> 1554.48]  your hero type type hero reference that one's for you yep hashtag ad is a harmony of dried fruit
[1554.48 --> 1560.98]  milk chocolate and floral peach oh and we're actually gonna add this bag we're gonna add this
[1560.98 --> 1566.32]  bag to the shop for a little bit as a limited time so that some people who weren't cron members can get
[1566.32 --> 1573.08]  them because i know there's a lot of trash supporters out there yeah i can't drink caffeinated
[1573.08 --> 1578.92]  coffee anymore because i get too freaked i get i get too wired i can see we got a sick decaf blend 404
[1578.92 --> 1587.24]  oh really yeah and one sec and i have not had this and i i don't have a bag of this for what reason
[1587.24 --> 1594.42]  again well when you go because you haven't gone on to ssh terminal.shop do i look like someone who knows
[1594.42 --> 1600.70]  how to use ssh to you i'm the person who still does not understand and will never understand why i have
[1600.70 --> 1607.42]  to use sfdp to transfer files instead of just when i'm in ssh just saying put the thing like how is that
[1607.42 --> 1613.58]  not a thing you just said you're an ssh you just lied to me what there you go do you like this casey
[1613.58 --> 1620.62]  404 caffeine not found yes i'll send you some talk to me talk to me after you guys know what i'm saying
[1620.62 --> 1626.62]  right isn't that confusing i don't understand it how come you have to like if you're in ssh why can't you
[1626.62 --> 1633.26]  just transfer files through that it does seem like you should be able to scp secure copy copy
[1634.62 --> 1638.78]  you can just type scp now and copy something from the local machine to the remote machine without
[1638.78 --> 1646.22]  running the 80s were wild can you actually do that yeah yeah scp exists i'm pretty sure help you just
[1646.22 --> 1652.30]  it's it's literally just ssh for our sync true our sync is even better it was crazy because like they
[1652.30 --> 1657.82]  made our sync and then after that they made dropbox and dropbox really just our sync right no no okay i
[1657.82 --> 1661.10]  want to get this straight i would get this straight because you guys might be lying to me here i want
[1661.10 --> 1666.62]  to i want to know you're telling me the truth scp is real scp is real so if you are in an ssh
[1666.62 --> 1676.62]  your terminal right now use weasel 2 okay and just type in scp dash dash help no no no i mean in an
[1676.62 --> 1681.18]  ssh you're in ssh you want to just be like i'm on this machine i want to copy something that's
[1681.18 --> 1686.70]  right oh yeah that's what i'm talking about got you got you i don't know if that's possible see
[1687.42 --> 1693.82]  see this is like you're right there you're on the machine you have a tunnel set up you just want the
[1693.82 --> 1699.50]  thing to transfer a freaking file and it's like z upload is that a thing nah bro that sounds like a
[1699.50 --> 1706.78]  site where you download nx and yes it does okay i'm just throwing it out there guys yes it does
[1707.90 --> 1713.66]  are you ready to move to the next thing here yes at the end of the day nobody knows what happened
[1713.66 --> 1718.14]  with jira so we're just gonna have to call that one and no well we're gonna have to wait and find out
[1718.78 --> 1723.02]  i i know but i've taught every single person i've talked to just said i have no idea i have never
[1723.02 --> 1728.38]  understood i don't i have no idea what they're gonna do with this other than oh it's no one's gonna use
[1728.38 --> 1735.26]  it 100 yeah i mean it just seems confusing anyways yeah go ahead go ahead go ahead all right so this
[1735.26 --> 1741.18]  next section which i'm calling uh too much ai i saw this little tweet earlier and i thought that maybe
[1741.18 --> 1746.94]  you would like to take a little look at it yeah yeah i said i tried manually coding a feature and i just
[1746.94 --> 1752.78]  can't anymore it's like i know how to do it but my body simply refuses to do this manually again no matter
[1752.78 --> 1754.94]  how wrong the lm agent will be
[1758.70 --> 1762.38]  that too much ai have we finally hit the peak of too much ai but hold on there's more
[1763.66 --> 1768.70]  this little beautiful one right here is everybody's favorite company coinbase which is
[1768.70 --> 1774.06]  40 of daily code written at coinbase is ai generated and they're trying to get it to 50
[1774.06 --> 1782.46]  50 which honestly when i hear of a company that is based on irreversible financial uh transactions
[1782.46 --> 1788.46]  you know what i hope for high percentage of ai coding i was just gonna say like so i am looking
[1788.46 --> 1795.66]  forward to the next n coinbase hacks of which there will be many they're just generating 10 million
[1795.66 --> 1802.14]  like it's not gonna change anything but they're doing that that is all tailwind changes there's no
[1802.14 --> 1807.58]  way they're letting it have hit he literally says in the tweet on that one some code should not be ai
[1807.58 --> 1812.70]  generated it's surely that they have like a million vibe coders pushing forward random features on the
[1812.70 --> 1817.74]  front end and the dips are all plus 30 000 lines you know what i mean like that i please be the case
[1817.74 --> 1823.98]  coinbase please be the case they're probably also potentially somehow considering like tab auto
[1823.98 --> 1829.74]  completion maybe they're like hand waving like ah 20 which is just you know like they're just saying oh
[1829.74 --> 1836.30]  that also counts i don't even know how someone even i mean that like a lot of a lot of code so
[1838.54 --> 1843.74]  i can look at a project you know on github or something that was made before ai and i'm like yeah i
[1843.74 --> 1848.38]  could believe this was all ai generated like the the coding quality is like super low right it's just
[1848.38 --> 1853.42]  like piles and piles and piles and piles and piles of stuff clearly swiss cheese like if you were
[1853.42 --> 1859.34]  a security researcher you'd just be like well i'm getting a lot of papers out of this right um so i would
[1859.34 --> 1864.78]  believe it i i don't think we weren't rolling we did not roll into the ai era with high coding
[1864.78 --> 1870.70]  standards we rolled in with rock bottom coding standards so i believe people when they say 40
[1870.70 --> 1874.46]  because i'm like i can't tell the difference between the code you're writing before and the code that this
[1874.46 --> 1880.22]  ai is spitting out looks the same it's just complete garbage where you just pile crap on top of each other
[1880.22 --> 1887.34]  and duplicate code 50 million times it doesn't look different to me so i i believe people when they say
[1887.34 --> 1892.30]  that uh maybe they're lying but i don't think they have to be because i could believe it you know
[1894.06 --> 1899.90]  i don't think coinbase is a fort knox of security right uh fort knox doesn't even have gold in it
[1899.90 --> 1907.82]  anymore casey yeah yeah man actually where did all the where's the gold audit where's the fort knox
[1907.82 --> 1912.46]  gold audit trash you can look it up bill gates microchips have all the gold in them they needed the gold
[1912.46 --> 1917.82]  for the chips for the microchips for the 5g receivers trash look up when was the last time
[1917.82 --> 1922.94]  we got to go see in the inside of fort knox the only thing i remember from fort knox is in die
[1922.94 --> 1929.74]  hard with a vengeance and that movie was awesome didn't see it i didn't see that one well the idea
[1930.54 --> 1936.14]  have we hit to is is this too much ai have we finally hit it where people just don't even they're
[1936.14 --> 1941.02]  like ah because it's not like llms can just do everything so we're kind of in this weird world where
[1941.74 --> 1946.46]  you do have to manually code quite a few things but if everyone's just like i don't even want to do
[1946.46 --> 1952.54]  it like what what what what does that mean what does that say for us i mean i use ai to do like the
[1952.54 --> 1959.66]  stuff that's just really easy to do but what does that mean so like um all of his work
[1961.42 --> 1967.98]  well my job no no but like it's time to show up to the podcast no like i'll have it like
[1967.98 --> 1972.14]  run like these guys doing my job right now why do you think i could be here dude i just i just
[1972.14 --> 1978.54]  shipped like 30 new features just now okay i'm getting paid and i'm shipping features no but like
[1978.54 --> 1982.46]  if it's just like hey test this for me and like these different scenarios or like yesterday i had to
[1982.46 --> 1987.02]  like test some caching stuff and i was like i gave it some like uh to do's of like test this scenario
[1987.02 --> 1991.66]  for the cache and make sure the cache isn't validated it just did all the tests for me from what i
[1991.66 --> 1997.50]  could tell properly um or like or just like small refactor stuff that are just kind of like grunt work
[1997.50 --> 2004.22]  um i will always delegate that to the i like that caveat for what i could tell probably
[2004.22 --> 2009.42]  like i will say i told you to test the thing and it tested the whole thing
[2010.78 --> 2015.10]  like i mean it was it worked for like an hour it must have done something i don't know but like
[2015.10 --> 2019.34]  literally like 80 of the time i'm like that's not right and it's just like you're right i should
[2019.34 --> 2022.94]  so it's kind of annoying and that's some at some point i just stop and i'm just i do it myself but
[2023.58 --> 2029.58]  you know we'll say though trash yeah like i i'm quite a bit more willing to change like the the shape
[2029.58 --> 2036.94]  of something if like like let's say we have like 10 instances or like 10 to 30 or something like
[2036.94 --> 2041.02]  because i'm working on mordoria right now for our game and like sometimes we like make enemies one
[2041.02 --> 2045.50]  way to start and i realize we need to change it i'm like a lot more willing to change that now than
[2045.50 --> 2050.14]  i used to be because i can just say like hey here i can be like you know whatever cursor or open code
[2050.14 --> 2054.54]  or whatever like here's the file that looks right now here's the directory of the rest of them like
[2054.54 --> 2058.70]  make them all look like this one that's literally what i did yeah yeah literally what i do i'm like
[2058.70 --> 2064.62]  here's a working example just copy it yes don't do anything else like go fix the other ones there's
[2064.62 --> 2069.10]  20 of them that are the wrong way we had to like move this thing into this child thing and now we're
[2069.10 --> 2074.70]  passing it here boom it's like even like even you know sometimes sure you could do a macro and you
[2074.70 --> 2078.14]  could do some other stuff like that and like i could get through quite a few of them sometimes
[2078.14 --> 2082.38]  like pretty quickly but sometimes it's not quite so obvious right it's like i'm changing the name
[2082.38 --> 2086.62]  of something to be slightly different and it's not really like macroable really or whatever
[2086.62 --> 2095.34]  uh that is an easy way to generate 5 000 lines of code exactly that is that is essentially zero
[2095.34 --> 2101.18]  in a way right because it's like it's it's it's like i changed a bunch of stuff sure it's ai generated
[2101.18 --> 2107.50]  so it's like technically it's true but it's really like i just ran a macro like on on this thing so it's
[2107.50 --> 2114.70]  more like you know it's the change number of lines like for some reason we think measuring how much code ai
[2114.70 --> 2120.70]  writes is good by lines of code but we would never decide whether a software developer is a good
[2120.70 --> 2125.82]  software developer at a company by measuring how many lines of code they did this year there's some
[2125.82 --> 2129.82]  stuff like did they write any like okay well they gotta write something to do something good
[2130.70 --> 2133.18]  so there's some there's some cases where it's obvious but you wouldn't be like
[2133.82 --> 2140.38]  ah tom over there he wrote a hundred thousand lines last week in j diesel and so he's really the
[2140.38 --> 2148.14]  guy that we love tom's a genius you'd be like no in in general it's usually the other way around so i
[2148.14 --> 2156.14]  would usually measure productivity by features and how few lines of code it took right so like
[2156.14 --> 2160.06]  if you tell me you can implement this feature in a hundred lines of code that's way better than
[2160.06 --> 2165.18]  someone's like oh man i put that feature and it the ai wrote 30 000 lines of code i'm like because i see
[2165.18 --> 2171.02]  that a lot online and i'm like do you guys have any idea what you can do in c in 30 lines thousand
[2171.02 --> 2175.50]  lines of code let alone like something like python we could have a whole game inside your application
[2175.50 --> 2180.70]  like you literally can do an entire game engine in around 10 000 lines of code if you want to
[2180.70 --> 2185.66]  right and so you did 30 000 lines of code and they're like i moved this button and you're like
[2186.30 --> 2191.34]  what the hell is wrong with you like how is this possible so there is a lot of that where i look at the
[2191.34 --> 2195.02]  things that people are stating as like supposed evidence that things went well and i'm like
[2195.98 --> 2201.66]  that sounds terrible but again i mean i think when you roll in with such rock bottom standards
[2201.66 --> 2206.54]  i mean that apparently skates as something that is quote unquote evidence that this is working well
[2206.54 --> 2213.02]  but sounds like it's working terribly i would love to see we have 90 of our code that's getting deleted
[2213.02 --> 2218.46]  is by ai yeah that's what you want going through that's what you want and it's ai bros that's what it
[2218.46 --> 2226.22]  should be it should be like i ran this thing on this 500 mil you know 500 000 line guitar repo and it
[2226.22 --> 2231.34]  reduced it to 50 000 lines and it still does all the same stuff that's the ai you actually want right
[2232.22 --> 2239.18]  yeah maybe can it reduce entropy that's what i want i so far i've seen it add a lot of entropy to
[2239.18 --> 2244.38]  my systems which sometimes it needs that's okay could still be productive and helpful or you're in
[2244.38 --> 2249.58]  javascript land and everything's entropy there's no such thing as just i gotta install 37 tools to
[2249.58 --> 2257.34]  get through my day uh but yeah it's i would love to see more like hey 30 you know 30 of our prs are
[2257.34 --> 2263.98]  code reduction prs by ai it starts up stuff and like finds patterns that we wrote the same 37 times
[2263.98 --> 2268.46]  throughout the code base and wraps it up into one solves which it feels like it should be able to do but
[2268.46 --> 2274.38]  for some reason is not doing so i don't know like i don't really know what's going on there if it's
[2274.38 --> 2280.14]  just a case of like the people who are training these things don't train them properly or what i
[2280.14 --> 2284.70]  don't know or maybe it's just a really hard it's a lame demo compared to one-shotting something i think
[2284.70 --> 2290.30]  that's one of honestly guys okay it's one of the big problems is like a lot of stuff is based on the demo
[2290.30 --> 2297.74]  is zero to one and not you know 38 to 42 right you know they just don't really care about 38 to 42 as much
[2297.74 --> 2303.98]  are these football terms because i don't know i'm saying like zero to one like the touchdown and
[2303.98 --> 2310.06]  yes uh no i was just zero to one like i don't have any code to like a minimum like an mvp i'm saying
[2310.06 --> 2314.30]  i knew that one but i didn't know the 38 to 42. i just picked two random numbers of like farther in
[2314.30 --> 2320.46]  the future all right yeah i still don't get it yeah that's all right just doing a scale of zero to 60.
[2320.46 --> 2326.14]  60 being your i was just making up random numbers okay and hoping that they weren't a dog whistle
[2326.14 --> 2330.94]  code to get somewhat better like i just want things to improve and right now ai seems to be
[2330.94 --> 2335.02]  doing the opposite that's the thing right so i don't think they could do even what you're saying
[2335.02 --> 2338.86]  with the whole like find patterns and reduce it i'm not sure if ai can do that because it might
[2339.50 --> 2344.22]  because i'm positive if you took tree sitter and you just said how many like similar patterns do i
[2344.22 --> 2349.66]  have my code base just like structurally speaking you could find patterns all over the place throughout
[2349.66 --> 2354.14]  your code base structurally and it's just like what does it mean to an ai to find things of
[2354.14 --> 2359.10]  similar pattern or shape you might i i'm not sure if this this might be actually a really hard problem
[2359.66 --> 2363.34]  that is not very obvious to us because for us it's very easy to see what should be
[2364.06 --> 2369.26]  or i know i say that so flippantly but a lot of people get it wrong but you get the idea that it's
[2369.26 --> 2372.94]  easy to look at things and be like oh i can make this more simple by moving it to here but that's
[2372.94 --> 2377.18]  also one of those amazing parts about humans is it takes a hundred neurons to tell if something's
[2377.18 --> 2381.74]  a cat and it takes trillions of operations for an lm to see if something's a cat right it's just
[2381.74 --> 2389.34]  yeah well i mean the vast difference is incredible i just mean like all right i mean that could be true
[2389.34 --> 2394.38]  in which case ai is just doomed right but i'm like if all the people out there who are ai optimists i'm
[2394.38 --> 2399.42]  like you should be showing me this like show me the thing that actually does something good instead of
[2399.42 --> 2406.22]  the thing that always poops out poop right like um yeah encoding it feels like coding it feels like we're
[2406.22 --> 2411.18]  still at the thing where it like generates 17 fingers on the guy's hand in the photo right like that's
[2411.18 --> 2417.26]  where it feels like we're at in code and so like i want to see someone that's like no it can actually
[2417.26 --> 2423.02]  draw a human fairly reliably now like what get us there at some point please yeah i mean because
[2423.02 --> 2427.82]  people are using these tools and they're very bad in my opinion yeah i've had good success if like
[2428.94 --> 2434.78]  the problem is well scoped it's in a like code base that has similar patterns and i can say like the
[2434.78 --> 2438.38]  one we were saying before and trash i think you've said you've done this too of just like hey
[2438.38 --> 2444.46]  hey i i got i changed this one i updated it now i need you to go do this in like 40 files
[2444.46 --> 2450.46]  just go spend some tokens burn some electricity and solve this for me like that actually has worked
[2450.46 --> 2458.38]  really well for me and it is nice because it oh it like frees me up to fix my previous mistakes
[2458.38 --> 2464.22]  right in the sense i like sometimes you'd be like it's just not really worth it to like go and change
[2464.22 --> 2467.02]  the structure of this because you're gonna go find all the places and do all this stuff if you can
[2467.02 --> 2473.02]  just be like go find all the places and fix those for me uh it's nice so i've also i've used it like
[2473.02 --> 2477.98]  for a wide range of stuff but i do think people would be like better served by showing real examples
[2477.98 --> 2484.22]  of like i pointed at this code base and it reduced 2000 lines of code that for me i would be like that's
[2484.22 --> 2492.06]  awesome i would be way more excited for your project yeah it feels like it would be very useful and and
[2492.06 --> 2497.34]  what is more needed like uh on in a lot of these projects that i see like they're they're just when
[2497.34 --> 2501.26]  i look at them i'm like okay you guys you guys literally took like 10 000 lines of code to do
[2501.26 --> 2504.86]  something that's like literally 100 lines of code just because no one really knew what's going on and i
[2505.66 --> 2511.50]  maybe that's something ais can't do in the near term but it kind of doesn't feel
[2512.78 --> 2516.14]  it doesn't feel like that should be the case i just feel like they probably just don't have good
[2516.14 --> 2520.86]  training sets to like they probably just don't have a way to really train it to do that right now
[2520.86 --> 2526.62]  but you know that was one of the things um we didn't get to it last uh last episode but like
[2527.82 --> 2534.54]  uh i think honestly the not one of things people are underestimating about the training data on github
[2534.54 --> 2541.74]  is not just that you have code there but that you can actually see the changes over time and like
[2541.74 --> 2548.30]  training on diffs and other stuff like that right or uh recently i saw an article where uh open ai
[2548.30 --> 2553.02]  maybe in microsoft or someone else i don't know was thinking about licensing like cursor edits or
[2553.02 --> 2558.14]  something for people who have like that turned on or whatever like yeah because it needs to see that
[2558.14 --> 2563.18]  but of course the problem is if everyone is doing the thing that i'm complaining about which is hey i
[2563.18 --> 2568.86]  just spammed out 10 000 lines of code to move the button over here or whatever then that means that ai
[2568.86 --> 2574.86]  learns that way and and that's a problem right so and i don't know how you fix that problem other than
[2574.86 --> 2579.26]  you have to shift the way that you're doing your ai to one that's more of an adversarial training
[2579.26 --> 2584.06]  process like more like an alpha go kind of a thing yeah which i guess they just haven't really quite
[2584.62 --> 2589.42]  gotten enough of that into the process yet or whatever i'm gonna be i'm still gonna have a job
[2589.42 --> 2594.54]  writing code later because they're gonna just be paying me to write code to train ai off me see so
[2594.54 --> 2600.22]  that's that's my job security casey do you think it's gonna be like a like a a boutique thing in
[2600.22 --> 2606.94]  the future where it's like uh you're you you kind of like have a an officially licensed like kind of
[2606.94 --> 2612.78]  like you know you have officially licensed sport like a this is michael jordan's shoe it's like this
[2612.78 --> 2619.66]  is tj's like you know ai that you use and it programs like him or whatever or you can be like him
[2619.66 --> 2625.10]  when you program we should do that i want trash i want trash as my coding buddy the whole time he's
[2625.10 --> 2629.66]  like great work let's eat a dorito you know what i mean i'm like yeah i want to be the modern day
[2629.66 --> 2634.30]  clippy all right there you go can you just imagine me like can you imagine me just in the bottom right
[2634.30 --> 2639.66]  here in your corner it's like dude that's sick trash we need to make that we actually need to make
[2639.66 --> 2646.78]  that it looks like we're trying to be incredibly baller go for it you know what you deserve a dorito
[2646.78 --> 2651.82]  let's go all right i gotta go to jujitsu i'll be right back and then it just disappears for like
[2651.82 --> 2657.18]  two hours don't ask for me for like a couple hours i gotta go work out and there's a little silhouette
[2657.18 --> 2661.58]  of it like going like doing all this stuff and like throwing the dude across your desktop dancing
[2661.58 --> 2667.66]  avatars on windows when they had those like you could have the dancing avatars yeah oh man
[2668.38 --> 2673.90]  well that stuff has evolved now you know that right like yeah there's an entire market of idle games
[2673.90 --> 2678.78]  that run down in the taskbar basically like yeah on the bottom of your windows desktop so
[2678.78 --> 2683.74]  you know that that could be where that could be where trash is ultimately headed yeah i like that
[2683.74 --> 2689.74]  trash we can make that happen we can immortalize you true trash idlers a new genre of trash
[2690.94 --> 2696.06]  all right so i'm gonna attempt to steal man some of the ai i think things that has been flowing
[2696.06 --> 2701.50]  through a lot of like the the normies thought process on this all which is that computers are fast
[2701.50 --> 2708.14]  enough to process a lot of code and we call these things like tech debt or poorly written code but
[2708.14 --> 2713.34]  if an ai can fix the poorly written code and it doesn't matter how many times it's copied it doesn't
[2713.34 --> 2718.06]  matter about all that if it just keeps on abstracting you away and it's just able to take care of all of
[2718.06 --> 2723.34]  those headaches it doesn't matter if the diff was 10 lines or a thousand lines because at the end of the
[2723.34 --> 2730.86]  the day computers are fast enough and we should be able to produce out the exact uh like feature set
[2730.86 --> 2735.42]  we want regardless of the quality of the code and when i need to refactor i don't think about
[2735.42 --> 2740.30]  refactoring i'm just like hey update this and it goes and it finds all the places and it does either
[2740.30 --> 2746.14]  the manually updating or maybe god forbid it it reduces entropy and does some sort of refactoring
[2746.14 --> 2750.46]  but at the end of the day it's just like no that's not a problem that's not that's not the way we
[2750.46 --> 2754.94]  think about things well there's several problems with it right the very first one and most important
[2754.94 --> 2759.82]  one for this domain is security because the more lines of code you have the more exploits you have
[2759.82 --> 2766.22]  almost always right so that's problem a because we're talking about a lot of times we're talking
[2766.22 --> 2771.18]  about like web development stuff so it's not like a video game or something where you're just running it
[2771.18 --> 2775.58]  in some situation where maybe you just don't care because it's like completely you know it's on the
[2775.58 --> 2782.70]  playstation and it's completely isolated processor whatever who knows um thing two is performance is
[2782.70 --> 2787.26]  already abysmal i mean i'm already sitting here i click a button and i wait you know like sometimes
[2787.26 --> 2791.66]  this is a good thought by the way i this is just me trying to steel man as much as possible
[2791.66 --> 2796.86]  the problem is computers aren't fast enough they just aren't we've still managed to slow them down
[2796.86 --> 2803.82]  and the problem is the way in which they slow down right now is very very very tied to the structure of
[2803.82 --> 2809.98]  what you're doing so if you have your ai's generating all these like server round trips
[2809.98 --> 2815.82]  or whatever because that implements the feature well your customers will be waiting longer and longer
[2815.82 --> 2822.70]  and longer to click the button or to open up the app or all the other things which people claim is fine
[2822.70 --> 2827.18]  but whenever anyone does a study they find that like every additional hundred milliseconds costs
[2827.18 --> 2834.94]  them money like cost them actual revenue right and so it's not okay right it's not okay to sacrifice
[2834.94 --> 2840.30]  performance because it actually not only does it ruin everything for everybody who actually uses your
[2840.30 --> 2845.42]  software but it actually does end up hurting you in the long run too so that's a problem thing number
[2845.42 --> 2852.94]  three is wait where is the electricity coming from someone still needs to explain where the electricity is
[2852.94 --> 2859.90]  coming from right lightning okay come on i was gonna say zeus what are you talking about dude that's
[2859.90 --> 2865.02]  how we get our electricity we just get lightning i i want i really still at some point want to hear
[2865.02 --> 2868.54]  what they're just coming it's going to be building more nuclear power plants i guess i'm not sure
[2868.54 --> 2873.58]  because obviously like we've had this whole push of like everyone in silicon valley is falling all over
[2873.58 --> 2877.74]  themselves to tell us what great people they are and how wonderful they are and how they're on the right
[2877.74 --> 2883.58]  side of all these social causes and they're like also by the way we're going to use roughly the power
[2883.58 --> 2889.10]  consumption of germany for all of our data center things added up right i mean i think germany is like
[2889.10 --> 2896.22]  60 gigawatts and ai data one ai data center is one gigawatt can i give you a fun fact yeah i did a little
[2896.22 --> 2904.14]  bit of research on this so to fly a fully loaded jet from la to new york yeah happens about 22 to 26 times a
[2904.14 --> 2912.06]  day okay it would take approximately 183 days of full flights back and forth to equal one day of
[2912.06 --> 2919.90]  chat gpt yeah processing power in gpt5 it's not good right this is not good yeah so every two days
[2919.90 --> 2925.74]  is a year worth of burning that much stuff when i walked back to the future though he just did it
[2925.74 --> 2930.30]  like in his car he made a lot of jaco watts casey so like i don't understand what the concern is well
[2930.30 --> 2934.62]  the concern is just like where it's gonna come from and maybe the answer is like the the we build
[2934.62 --> 2938.94]  more nuclear power plants or something which might be fine but that is not happening currently so i
[2938.94 --> 2942.94]  don't know is it just burning coal or something which is not going to be a good outcome right
[2943.58 --> 2946.38]  the thing along dinosaur juice clean out of the ground buddy
[2951.02 --> 2956.86]  people people want dinosaurs back so if we put it all back in the air we can have dinosaurs again we can
[2956.86 --> 2961.42]  make the planet warm enough for dinosaurs again this is the whole point of the whole thing right
[2961.42 --> 2966.14]  in the movie the dinosaurs die at the end and then scarlett johansson has to go to an island and save
[2966.14 --> 2974.30]  people i would love to see a dinosaur like in chat gpt you remember same guy in a little bit of trouble
[2974.30 --> 2979.74]  with that i don't what happened he tried to clone he asked if scarlett johansson wanted to be the voice
[2979.74 --> 2986.30]  of chat gpt she said no so we got a copy and then it was like oh we didn't get you we got someone else
[2986.30 --> 2990.94]  that was like the beginning of the whole ai craze okay my serious thing i want to say about what
[2990.94 --> 2999.82]  you were saying casey too is that uh like it even if you think ai is still going to write all your
[2999.82 --> 3005.18]  code it's actually better if ai can do it more concisely for regular people because you're going
[3005.18 --> 3012.54]  to pay by the token but that actually leaves a perverse incentive it sure does ai companies who at
[3012.54 --> 3018.86]  least for people training models i think like cursor would prefer you to take less tokens because
[3018.86 --> 3025.34]  they don't want to have to charge you more money right right but like open ai they like yes all the
[3025.34 --> 3031.26]  code takes a lot of tokens and it churns a lot all the time because then they say excellent your entire
[3031.26 --> 3037.50]  business depends on you sending this back to me and you don't know what to do with it so they're like
[3037.50 --> 3043.10]  like they have a very perverse incentive actually to like well we'll just keep pushing the context
[3043.10 --> 3048.14]  window bigger that's really what you need you really need two million tokens of context and load
[3048.14 --> 3052.78]  that bad boy up load it up you know like which also means that they have agent problems too right
[3052.78 --> 3056.54]  oh you know what we need the our agents are going to get extra smart they're going to double check every
[3056.54 --> 3064.70]  file right yeah i would also point out that unlike so one of the nice things about a current data center
[3064.70 --> 3069.26]  like if you were just looking at like a data center that you built for i don't know aws or something
[3070.46 --> 3077.98]  or a google data center for the most part they're pretty multi-purpose like you can do lots of
[3077.98 --> 3083.42]  different stuff with it you know you can you could run some really slick very custom very efficient
[3083.42 --> 3088.06]  application on it that was written to bare metal or whatever you want right you could do all kinds of
[3088.06 --> 3093.90]  stuff or you can run like 12 layers of bloated python you could do whatever you want right and the data
[3093.90 --> 3098.86]  center will just they're pretty general purpose and there might be certain use cases that they're
[3098.86 --> 3104.38]  maybe not optimal for but it's it we can it can adapt right and so all of us out there can use it
[3104.38 --> 3110.46]  for various reasons an ai dentist center can only do one thing and one thing only and that is low
[3110.46 --> 3115.34]  precision matrix multiplies that's basically it like it's not going to do anything else well it's not
[3115.34 --> 3120.78]  going to be power efficient doing anything else it's going to be very power hungry uh if you were to run
[3120.78 --> 3125.58]  anything else on it because most of the equipment in it and the entire structure and like it's liquid
[3125.58 --> 3129.90]  cooled right is it's not going to be air cooled like a normal data center blah blah blah i mean there's
[3129.90 --> 3133.82]  some there are some data centers that are liquid cooled but either way i'm saying like they're designed
[3133.82 --> 3138.70]  totally differently and they have way more power being pushed through them because that's how ai you
[3138.70 --> 3144.22]  know ai is a very sustained high load kind of a thing so we're also building out a tremendous amount
[3144.22 --> 3149.74]  of infrastructure that's completely useless for anything else but this and that also sucks in my
[3149.74 --> 3154.22]  opinion because what if this turns out to not be that great what if we find there's a much better
[3154.22 --> 3159.90]  way to be doing this stuff like what happens to all of this build out so that's not very encouraging
[3159.90 --> 3163.26]  either in my opinion but i guess you know their answer is just well we'll just build more data so
[3163.26 --> 3168.46]  like all right i mean i don't know it's it's just i don't love this kind of stuff i like general
[3168.46 --> 3174.62]  purpose computing i don't like this hyper specialized kind of thing but that's where we're at confirmed
[3174.62 --> 3184.86]  casey likes python 12 layers of things over cuda got it confirmed i mean but i i hate to say it
[3185.50 --> 3191.98]  but actually yes like oh we got that's kind of true like i love i love gpus and i love gpu programming
[3191.98 --> 3196.46]  i think that's very interesting if you're a gamer and you bought one was that better software conference
[3197.18 --> 3203.02]  you're not inviting casey back this year yeah exactly but i love the fact that the data center can do that
[3203.02 --> 3210.70]  i love that yes i i yeah i absolutely hate the fact that i have to use code that's 16 layers of
[3210.70 --> 3216.78]  python deep or whatever right but i absolutely love the fact that that worked and an ai data center
[3216.78 --> 3224.54]  literally cannot run that it would just roll over and die right so you know ask the ai to evaluate it
[3224.54 --> 3230.30]  and guess what the output would be i mean i shouldn't say it can't run it i mean obviously it can run it it
[3230.30 --> 3235.18]  it can run it it just costs so much more power to run it is the right way to say it right it's like
[3235.18 --> 3244.46]  it's not like it can't it's just it's so much less efficient yeah so well that was pretty neat
[3246.54 --> 3250.46]  okay it's a cool story it's a cool story do you i agree with you but hey guess what i think that
[3250.46 --> 3257.18]  means we're done for the day huh signing off for friday signing out for friday see you later great friday
[3257.18 --> 3264.14]  everyone
[3264.14 --> 3269.14]  Terminal Coffee and Hero
[3269.14 --> 3271.14]  Living the Dream
