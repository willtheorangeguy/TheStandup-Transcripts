[0.00 → 4.60] all right are you guys ready for this oh no but I am so ready dude
[4.60 → 12.56] I'm so ready right now okay you don't even know how much podcast I'm ready for
[12.56 → 24.76] uh anyway sorry go all right let's do it go welcome to the stand-up live every Wednesday
[24.76 → 30.68] and Friday at 11 a.m the lord's time 10 p or 10 a.m pacific standard time if you're in the valley
[30.68 → 38.44] 13 a.m crazy time third yes José did go or José did go can we meet at 13 a.m and I was like
[38.44 → 43.74] I got this i know what you're talking about all right back on topic today we are doing
[43.74 → 50.56] JIRA bought a browser unironically yesterday JIRA can I say yeah I'm gonna technically and actually
[50.56 → 56.32] you right now they bought two browsers oh true mm-hmm they did well they bought one company
[56.32 → 65.14] okay two browsers yeah tell them try to tell them okay, so this is more okay so the reason why I want to
[65.14 → 71.50] bring this up isn't because I think this topic is the single most interesting topic I just want to
[71.50 → 75.98] see Casey get confused like that's actually my primary reason for bringing this one up to
[75.98 → 81.08] the stand-up oh he's which is all right so yesterday at Asian uh Casey are you familiar
[81.08 → 87.62] with Asian and some of the wonderful tools they have created no I do I have heard of them vaguely
[87.62 → 96.58] I am like vaguely aware right I know they do some like git like thing uh trash I think before had
[96.58 → 101.30] said it was Bitbucket which is I remember correctly was like a pre like that was before git that's what
[101.30 → 109.28] they used before uh they stiffed Linus on it right that was like bit enforcer bit warden or bit
[109.28 → 114.48] something okay it was something different bucket it's one of those man no, no no at Asian owns bit
[114.48 → 121.64] bucket that became stash oh yeah we use that I think what was the there so originally way, way back when
[121.64 → 130.82] before all y'alls was born the kernel team for like so Linus like started using this
[130.82 → 137.12] the tech tips guy no yes the Linus tech tips the guy who wrote the Linux operating system
[137.12 → 143.04] I'm not gonna lie used to mix those two up all the time bit keeper Casey it's bit keeper okay and it
[143.04 → 149.00] wasn't it wasn't Linus that did that it's somebody on Linux team broke the uh terms of service with
[149.00 → 154.58] bit keeper and reverse engineered their protocol, and they said they wouldn't and that's what caused
[154.58 → 159.24] them to have to switch because then they were getting dropped I just meant the then that's what made
[159.24 → 163.80] Linus right git right is they were like all right I guess we're we got to do our own thing now that
[163.80 → 170.30] was the only thing I remember okay so that was bit keeper so that means I literally have no idea what
[170.30 → 176.94] this company do I knew i I knew they did some kind of like git like thing I have no idea never touched
[176.94 → 184.00] if there's going to be a confluence of feature go for it no TJ has to go dang it trash
[184.00 → 192.54] it was so good trash josh run it back for me, I never said anything use AI to make this work josh
[192.54 → 199.14] there's going to be a confluence of features like you've never seen before something like that I don't
[199.14 → 205.80] remember what I was going to say because I got too mad hey jay Casey yeah you're going to have a confluence
[205.80 → 216.00] of Trello ticketing yes okay so Casey they make confluence which is like the world's worst wiki
[216.00 → 222.10] so if you're not familiar with like wikis somehow confluence it confluence is the only known
[222.10 → 228.78] like product that you cannot search with that is meant to be for searching for documents for teams to
[228.78 → 234.98] use except in the search bar autocomplete search bar autocomplete anybody please type one in chat
[234.98 → 240.90] to say it in the YouTube comments right now the autocomplete is the best search of all time and
[240.90 → 245.36] than everything else about confluence you cannot use at all it's just that it's just absolutely
[245.36 → 252.12] garbage it is crazy whether you're a vibe coder or a handcrafted free-range neo vim user you still
[252.12 → 257.64] need CI to be able to build your binaries run your tests or make your releases that's where blacksmith
[257.64 → 262.70] comes in it takes your GitHub actions and with a one-line change makes them faster and more cost
[262.70 → 267.92] effective not only that, but you can finally get visibility into your CI pipeline right when things
[267.92 → 272.38] go wrong we're happy to have them as our sponsor for this episode because just like us this one is
[272.38 → 277.52] truly a no-brainer sign up and enjoy faster GitHub action workflows at a much lower price blacksmith
[277.52 → 283.88] twice the speed and up to 75 reduction in costs check them out at blacksmith.sh now back to the
[283.88 → 290.48] stand-up everything's I heard um I heard after Elon bought x the entire search team went over to
[290.48 → 295.62] confluence that's what i that's what I heard confluence search is worse than is worse than
[295.62 → 300.50] twitter like it is actually worse it's objectively worse you didn't think it was possible, but it's
[300.50 → 304.82] worse they managed to figure out how to make something that shows none of the words you type in
[305.46 → 311.24] okay so you know everything you love about corporate enterprise culture and software
[311.24 → 317.68] so it turns out you know how like Frito-Lay owns every snack you find in the grocery store like
[317.68 → 324.88] even if there's seven different ones Atlassian is the Frito-Lay of enterprise software you're like oh my
[324.88 → 331.26] goodness I can't believe that they're taking 17 minutes to load up this custom page with 37 different
[331.26 → 337.38] tags for every single ticket that they have with story points and t-shirt sizes and everybody has 13 ways
[337.38 → 342.14] to interact with the ticket that thing is also made by the same people that can't figure out how to
[342.14 → 349.68] search text in your wiki same people makes sense to make sense also do a stash which stash is actually
[349.68 → 358.02] the objectively worst version of GitHub which I know that is shocking for now so since they had
[358.02 → 362.54] nothing to do with bit keeper which is the only thing i actually vaguely knew because we looked at it
[362.54 → 371.34] briefly at rad at the time way back when before git existed so Bitbucket which I guess is now stashed
[371.34 → 376.60] is what exactly are they literally just running git with the front end on top of it or what is it
[376.60 → 382.70] it's just imagined GitHub for corporations private hosted GitHub for corporations isn't GitHub also for
[382.70 → 388.76] corporations this was before and plus you could own it so it's not like it's its like self-hosted
[388.76 → 393.54] that's one of the big differences that you can self hope you can commercially self-host your version
[393.54 → 398.44] of it so that way you own everything whereas GitHub's like we own everything you get to say you
[398.44 → 403.58] have you get your own little slice on our stuff right we won't show it to anyone else except us
[403.58 → 408.90] yeah except for copilot will love your stuff yeah dude and anyone in our company who wants to
[408.90 → 413.66] look at it, you can self-host GitHub okay well this was at one point you couldn't that's you know this
[413.66 → 418.78] thing but what are you saying trash all right we're getting distracted well teach brought off
[418.78 → 425.78] Frito-Lay so I google what Frito-Lay owns that they make all my favourite chips which are sun chips
[425.78 → 433.30] okay all right ruffles someone clip food white cheddar popcorn yep that's a good one Cheetos
[433.30 → 438.72] porticos salsa were you about to say tortillas
[438.72 → 443.48] trash be honest it sounded like you were halfway to tortillas some fajitas and tortillas
[443.48 → 448.72] look if it's is it's a flotilla it's a tortilla they're spelled the same way
[449.38 → 452.82] I'm chicken vagina on a tortilla please
[452.82 → 461.46] delicious okay so that is what Atlassian is they've always built developer productivity
[461.46 → 467.32] very heavy air quotes on the word productivity tools right, but it's always been enterprise focus
[467.32 → 476.56] productivity and yesterday the CEO drops a two-minute video on why they acquired a browser
[476.56 → 481.28] okay and I'm going to give you the best quote I personally think of the video
[481.28 → 487.54] which is I already know some people use browsers to browse
[487.54 → 491.80] and whereas other people use browsers to work
[491.80 → 504.68] and that's why we spent 610 million dollars in an all cash offer to acquire this company with one
[504.68 → 510.48] product that people loved, but they abandoned and a new AI one that all I can find is people who hate
[510.48 → 517.20] and hold on but okay so at first I thought holy cow they spent a lot of money cash on hand money
[517.20 → 526.44] to be able to buy this but then I realized windsurf which is a tertiary clone of VS Code sold for
[526.44 → 532.28] like three plus billion except it didn't right wasn't it more like they just took the people and
[532.28 → 537.70] literally left windsurf with the company google did that but then Devon bought the rest
[537.70 → 542.76] so google got the Google got one part of it and Devon got the other part google took the parents
[542.76 → 549.36] two Christmas now yeah they have two Christmas that windsurf very confusing so here's what I would
[549.36 → 557.56] would like to know if is I may ask in this particular case based on everything you said about this
[557.56 → 563.72] company who cannot implement tech search properly I'm guessing they did not actually write a browser
[563.72 → 570.82] so is this just like we re-skinned you know web we have to back up Casey we have to back up sorry we
[570.82 → 576.80] Atlassian is the parent company that purchased the browser company so the browser company
[576.80 → 581.52] browser company of New York browser company of New York true which obviously the browser company of
[581.52 → 589.34] somewhere else can I say i I do want to say that's a pretty sick name yeah I actually think of all the
[589.34 → 595.40] things that they made their name is the coolest okay so I could do browser company of California and
[595.40 → 601.44] you could trash unless it's taken that's kind of Google's thing, but maybe you could maybe yeah I'm
[601.44 → 604.68] thinking you could be you could be the other browser company
[604.68 → 614.28] uh but can you just it's a chromium fork so they made a chromium fork first in this is this they
[614.28 → 619.00] made arc was this browser that was like a chromium fork, but they did a lot more stuff than like
[619.00 → 623.90] normal for these chromium forks they wrote like their own whole like UI kit thing and all this
[623.90 → 628.94] other so that you could do a bunch of stuff that was not possible to do before in a chromium fork
[628.94 → 633.50] they like move tabs around and let you do like tab groups, and they took like everybody's favourite
[633.50 → 639.52] extensions and built it like faster and better in like a native way that was supposed to work better
[639.52 → 644.92] for everybody and people were like wow this browser is sick I love tabs on the side I'm going to make
[644.92 → 649.70] that my whole personality is that I have tabs on the side of my browser and set on the top
[649.70 → 654.28] I'm so much cooler and better than you better it is objectively better to have thanked you for
[654.28 → 659.84] proving my point and so then after they had that for a while they were not getting a lot of market
[659.84 → 665.88] share believe it or not a lot of armies thought hmm tabs on the side is worth me figuring
[665.88 → 672.92] out what the heck browsers are uh so then they're like you know what we need to do Casey can you guess
[672.92 → 676.74] what they needed to do after they didn't get market share yeah I mean they did it like
[676.74 → 683.70] you said they did AI I'm sure yeah I mean that's obvious right AI pivot is like that you know just
[683.70 → 692.10] where I mean there's literally just the thing where it's like um it's like someone is dropping money
[692.10 → 698.78] out of the top of a building and there's all these like dudes with buckets running like I need
[698.78 → 703.88] to cash in on some like it's coming down on the AI side, and they're all running over there hoping to
[703.88 → 707.72] catch some of it before they stop dumping the money out of the top I need to I need to catch some for
[707.72 → 714.46] real hey and trash are you tasting like a wave of nacho flavour over there or anything
[714.46 → 721.06] dude I just finished my bowl of cereal and I was like I'm still hungry so does anyone have a
[721.06 → 725.48] connection at Frito-Lay in the audience please if you're a YouTube viewer later, or you're in twitch chat
[725.48 → 733.38] right now true we at least half of the people in this call would chill Frito-Lay like none other
[733.38 → 740.60] on this podcast just throwing it out there for real okay so back to topic yep so literally somebody
[740.60 → 747.84] just spent 610 million dollars to buy a browser that because they put the tabs on the side
[747.84 → 753.94] so well here's the deal is they built that browser so that was called arc but then of course
[753.94 → 759.44] as TJ said no one used it so then they actually built a second one called DIA awful and DIA is
[759.44 → 766.48] supposed to be all yeah after these nuts that's what it's named for, and apparently it was so heavily
[766.48 → 771.02] AI indifferent that they actually had to roll back some of it and kind of go a bit more traditional
[771.02 → 775.00] than they were originally going for on it because people just couldn't understand it at all
[775.00 → 783.38] and they had Asian saw this browser, and they said we'll give you 610, and you know what we need
[783.38 → 789.06] AI browser and that was the whole pitch of the two-minute meeting oh just wait Bram stop trash said he
[789.06 → 794.56] has a joke I got it I got a joke play it they had no idea what they were doing
[794.56 → 811.82] i i I'm actually missing the joke I have no idea what the joke is at all but I don't know what the
[811.82 → 817.78] software is either so the browser's called DIA so I said they have no idea what they're doing
[817.78 → 824.96] are you kidding me did that just fly over everyone's head except for dude I couldn't
[824.96 → 828.64] help it because I was thinking of idea as an intelligent I was like trash it's a very different
[828.64 → 835.86] set of productivity trolls no chat got it trash chat is they all got it they were spam they get it
[836.50 → 843.32] man at least someone gets me dude I'm getting that into a short just for me and you I don't care
[843.32 → 851.54] no one else what or I guess I should say trash are you sure they didn't have an idea what they
[851.54 → 859.20] were doing oh man yeah they definitely had a couple ideas I can't, I can't, I don't even know
[859.20 → 863.52] I'm gone finish the sentence you got to think of something don't leave it hanging figure
[863.52 → 872.24] it out dude an idea that's pretty good uh okay look i just here 's's my first question among many
[872.24 → 879.70] yes my first question is what does it say about your company that the people you're buying are
[879.70 → 886.18] like we're going to need an all cash offer for that they're like we don't want stock in whatever this
[886.18 → 892.50] thing is that you've got here because it looks dire like what does that say that it was an all cash
[892.50 → 897.92] offer my guess is so actually i I just assume that literally the browser company is just cash in the
[897.92 → 901.96] bag like that's what it says to me when you get an all cash offer is that you are just taking the
[901.96 → 906.58] money you have probably some contractual period that some amount of people have to work for
[906.58 → 910.20] a heightened salary for some amount of time and the other people are just going to be like
[910.20 → 916.56] and then do the disappearing thing but still it's like i kind of figured they had a bunch of investors
[916.56 → 922.96] they needed to pay back okay uh from before I have no idea this is just pure speculation
[922.96 → 928.10] yeah if investors were like oh we can get a nice chunk of Atlassian now they would have been like
[928.10 → 934.10] cool but here they're like nope we do not want that like don't do be doing that to be fair
[934.10 → 940.70] Atlassian is the only company I know that has built a product that is universally like hated, and they're
[940.70 → 948.02] a billion dollar company like people hate JIRA yeah trash are a billion-dollar company I'm so impressed
[948.02 → 955.12] that a company could make so many things that are so bad but be like number one and everything like
[955.12 → 960.56] it just it's like are you talking about Microsoft again dude we're talking about it last time yeah
[960.56 → 964.64] yeah, but dude like it's its kind of crazy like when you just talk to the whole user base and
[964.64 → 969.80] they're just collectively against this company yeah, but you know who likes enterprise that's what
[969.80 → 975.24] enterprise is about, so the way enterprise managers love it the way enterprise software works
[975.24 → 982.60] is you make absolute dog poop so think Salesforce or something right, and then you have like a giant
[982.60 → 989.84] apparatus that goes out to someone's company and convinces upper level management that it's really
[989.84 → 995.88] useful, and then they buy it and then all of your employees hate it that's that's enterprise software
[995.88 → 1001.98] that is what it is right this is like people who are using it don't actually get a say in the decision
[1001.98 → 1007.88] which is why it's so terrible yeah my buddy who works at like a food distribution place used to work
[1007.88 → 1012.74] in sales they had their own thing, and then they moved to sap he literally was like I have to
[1012.74 → 1019.76] get out of here because all I do now is answer customer calls of where did our huge pallets of food go
[1019.76 → 1025.60] because they can't find them anymore they like lot they had lost so much stuff because they switched
[1025.60 → 1033.24] their inventory system because big companies use sap we're a big company now, and then it's awful and this
[1033.24 → 1037.86] is the same with as all the like you know the hr software and the health insurance management and
[1037.86 → 1043.38] all that stuff it's just all like complete garbage, but that's because that is not how it works like
[1043.38 → 1049.18] the people who actually use it have like no say right it's somebody who's like looking at like
[1049.18 → 1055.20] budgetary numbers and compliance issues and legal and all that stuff, and they're just signing off on
[1055.20 → 1060.80] it and then everyone gets to suffer that's like what it is so it's not surprising because enterprise
[1060.80 → 1065.24] software just isn't about delivering quality software and never was as far as I can tell
[1065.24 → 1072.52] so to be fair I feel like if I were to try to build JIRA feature for feature I might end in a very
[1072.52 → 1078.84] similar place oh it's the same it's the same result for sure yeah right like if is I really had to build
[1078.84 → 1084.48] something that made every manager happy but it but tried to make every employee also happy I think I'd end
[1084.48 → 1090.68] up in the exact same spot where every employee hates it half the managers like it and I'm just like well
[1090.68 → 1097.70] I tried well I made a billion I made a billion dollars whatever it's its trying to solve the
[1097.70 → 1102.18] like JIRA in particular is trying to solve the problem of when our project's going to be finished
[1102.18 → 1109.56] right well can't you just return rand mod that would be a more effective strategy
[1109.56 → 1115.92] yeah return rand mod two years or something and whatever comes back it's like that there you go
[1115.92 → 1122.24] this is her new AI prediction model a bunch of if statements so what do we think this browser is
[1122.24 → 1125.82] going to look like so I think like in the advertisement they say it's for like the worker
[1125.82 → 1130.96] right so we have a knowledge worker yeah we need a knowledge or agree with tab one billion of them too
[1130.96 → 1136.42] trash there's one billion knowledge workers worldwide yeah I don't even know where that number came from
[1136.42 → 1141.44] but sure I mean i saw it I don't know how we derived that how much knowledge workers are there
[1141.44 → 1148.70] exactly, exactly one and that's me the remaining billion the remaining billions do it right now
[1148.70 → 1153.90] you cannot come out with that and not this is a family friendly show you will not get trash
[1153.90 → 1156.22] we'll save that for iron digital
[1156.22 → 1161.70] anyway go ahead trash sorry you were asking about knowledge workers
[1161.70 → 1166.94] yeah but yeah so they're obviously it sounds like uh their sales pitch was like you have a lot of tabs
[1166.94 → 1172.06] so like confluence Trello god forbid you use Trello anyone that uses Trello
[1172.06 → 1176.98] okay what is Trello can you guys tell me what the hell Trello is this by the same company
[1176.98 → 1179.44] Trello is JIRA but with colour crayons
[1179.44 → 1181.92] but is it the same company or is it a different company
[1181.92 → 1187.88] it's owned by Atlassian as well, and it's a kanban board that's if it's just a drag and drop
[1187.88 → 1194.98] tasks between places so what okay so are you supposed to if you are a proper enterprise doing serious
[1194.98 → 1201.30] development no are you supposed to have JIRA and Trello, or you just have one or the other
[1201.30 → 1207.68] trello is for side projects and startups but not anymore because they got bought by Atlassian
[1207.68 → 1213.78] so now it's like lame isn't it linear or whatever is like the new that's the alternative to JIRA right
[1213.78 → 1219.66] oh my god yeah it's the new computer yes okay it's so this is the for me, I feel like this is kind of
[1219.66 → 1226.40] the funniest thing because everybody I know who liked browsers made by the browser company
[1226.40 → 1236.46] liked it I'm gonna just say it here's my hot take 97.3 percent of the reason they liked it was
[1236.46 → 1243.98] because they had cool promotional videos that made you feel like a cool person, and now they're owned
[1243.98 → 1252.82] by Atlassian your artsy hipster browser is owned by the universally hated enterprise company how can
[1252.82 → 1257.56] you get a good product they're going to get chewed up and spat out by the JIRA machine like it doesn't
[1257.56 → 1264.40] make any sense just go to that to be fair when they did so JIRA did do a two-minute is video
[1264.40 → 1268.86] kind of saying why they bought it and how they're gonna use AI, and we have too many tabs and all
[1268.86 → 1273.74] that the browser company did an 18-second video where just like looked at some leaves
[1273.74 → 1280.90] and a little mouse came up it just clicked twice, and it just said like coming soon or something
[1280.90 → 1290.04] that's what I'm saying all of their videos are like so when we did terminal.shop launch week we
[1290.04 → 1295.74] parodied like what they did intentionally as like a meme and tried to take ourselves as seriously as
[1295.74 → 1301.34] they could, I think we still didn't reach that level like I still couldn't take myself as seriously in a
[1301.34 → 1306.58] parody as they did so it's like I don't know how getting acquired by Atlassian is going to go over
[1306.58 → 1312.06] with their audience base it would be like your favourite local coffee shop gets bought up by Starbucks
[1312.06 → 1317.34] and like we're still going to be independent yeah guys we're still just a small coffee shop fighting
[1317.34 → 1322.72] against the man I did take the browser company of New York is now wearing like a full like three
[1322.72 → 1327.80] piece suit like kind of thing from yes from Wall Street, and they're sitting in Greenwich village and
[1327.80 → 1332.86] you're just like guys you're not the curly moustache and the bow tie now they have the suit on and all
[1332.86 → 1338.46] that they're they're not the hipsters anymore yeah okay right and so that part is I don't know how
[1338.46 → 1344.26] that's going to go over as for everybody's reaction who I knew used arc before that a lot of them left when
[1344.26 → 1350.14] the deep nuts scenario happened right like they were all like my artsy browser it's gone
[1350.14 → 1358.24] serious question do you all actually switch browsers ever I did switch to zen eventually just to try it
[1358.24 → 1363.10] out the side tabs I wanted to see where the side tabs and again I said like is it good did you did
[1363.10 → 1367.44] did you find i actually really my actually favourite part is the essentials you actually have like three
[1367.44 → 1371.86] different levels of things you can say as like super important sort of important and then just
[1371.86 → 1377.30] everything else and like that's been pretty useful okay that's funny because like i just
[1377.30 → 1381.88] been using the same setup for years I just see all these people like switching to this and this and
[1381.88 → 1385.88] then they ultimately come back to where I was and I'm just like Casey what browser are you using that's
[1385.88 → 1392.40] what I want to know yeah Casey Microsoft Edge uh currently brave but not for any real reason other
[1392.40 → 1398.40] than I just wanted a chromium based browser because Firefox kind of tanked like it doesn't really Firefox
[1398.40 → 1404.72] like barely runs any more it's like it's kind of questionable so Firefox is actually awful Firefox
[1404.72 → 1410.60] I'm using zen is Firefox based it is awful it's pretty bad now and I don't expect it to get much
[1410.60 → 1416.80] better so i just I don't know like I use browsers begrudgingly obviously and I don't really have to use
[1416.80 → 1424.32] them for much actual like work except that now that I do have a website that I have to maintain
[1424.32 → 1428.86] it's more work like so I actually do unfortunately spend more time in browsers than I would like
[1428.86 → 1433.76] uh so if there was like some really amazing browser that'd be great, but the problem with browsers is
[1433.76 → 1438.04] usually not the browser it's the web architecture so I don't really see how switching a web browser
[1438.04 → 1443.68] is really going to help much uh you know i I don't see it being something that's going to be useful
[1443.68 → 1449.42] long term putting like some kind of random you know sprinkling of fairy dust over the top of
[1449.42 → 1455.30] of the same underlying engine is not going to solve any problems that I have really yeah it's
[1455.30 → 1460.64] almost as if I wish I could order something through ssh right it's true if only there was an alternative
[1460.64 → 1467.50] way in which the internet could be bad where is your bag I don't have it order coffee via WSL you
[1467.50 → 1473.26] didn't get it yet no he did do I need to do WSL and then ssh and then order coffee yes I saved this
[1473.26 → 1478.92] I don't have open I don't have one oh someone else's picture oh what you still haven't gotten
[1478.92 → 1484.86] yours now was I supposed to get one yes 100 unless you lied to me, and you said you signed up for iron
[1484.86 → 1491.70] for no reason, and then you didn't do it I actually did not okay I completely forgot I completely forgot
[1491.70 → 1494.14] I will do it Casey check this out
[1494.14 → 1501.32] uh yes really close to the camera when I get mine I'm not even going to open it I'm just gonna
[1501.32 → 1505.14] put it in my office trash I'll send you I'll send you some more here's a question for you
[1505.14 → 1515.28] we are making fun of trash because he did hashtag ads ad just in case uh you know I don't I don't
[1515.28 → 1521.42] want to be mistaken about any of this could you tell me something about like the flavour and quality of
[1521.42 → 1526.50] this coffee since I can't myself experience it right now just to be clear this is for
[1526.50 → 1531.36] entertainment purposes only and does not constitute an advertisement I just want that to be clear
[1531.36 → 1538.00] before we do this uh because somebody on here got themselves in a little hot water on x.com the
[1538.00 → 1547.12] application uh this one is a medium blend from Papua New Guinea okay it's not just any coffee not just
[1547.12 → 1554.48] your hero type hero reference that one's for you yep hashtag ad is a harmony of dried fruit
[1554.48 → 1560.98] milk chocolate and floral peach oh, and we're actually going to add this bag we're going to add this
[1560.98 → 1566.32] bag to the shop for a little bit as a limited time so that some people who weren't iron members can get
[1566.32 → 1573.08] them because I know there are a lot of trash supporters out there yeah I can't drink caffeinated
[1573.08 → 1578.92] coffee anymore because I get too freaked i get too wired I can see we got a sick decaf blend 404
[1578.92 → 1587.24] oh really yeah and one sec and I have not had this and i I don't have a bag of this for what reason
[1587.24 → 1594.42] again well when you go because you haven't gone on to ssh terminal.shop do I look like someone who knows
[1594.42 → 1600.70] how to use ssh to you, I'm the person who still does not understand and will never understand why I have
[1600.70 → 1607.42] to use FDP to transfer files instead of just when I'm in ssh just saying put the thing like how is that
[1607.42 → 1613.58] not a thing you just said you're an ssh you just lied to me what there you go do you like this Casey
[1613.58 → 1620.62] 404 caffeine not found yes I'll send you some talk to me talk to me after you guys know what I'm saying
[1620.62 → 1626.62] right isn't that confusing I don't understand it how come you have to like if you're in ssh why can't you
[1626.62 → 1633.26] just transfer files through that it does seem like you should be able to SCP secure copy
[1634.62 → 1638.78] you can just type SCP now and copy something from the local machine to the remote machine without
[1638.78 → 1646.22] running the 80s were wild can you actually do that yeah yeah SCP exists I'm pretty sure help you just
[1646.22 → 1652.30] it's its literally just ssh for our sync true our sync is even better it was crazy because like they
[1652.30 → 1657.82] made our sync and then after that they made Dropbox and Dropbox really just our sync right no, no okay i
[1657.82 → 1661.10] want to get this straight I would get this straight because you guys might be lying to me here I want
[1661.10 → 1666.62] to I want to know you're telling me the truth SCP is real SCP is real so if you are in an ssh
[1666.62 → 1676.62] your terminal right now use weasel 2 okay and just type in SCP dash help no, no no I mean in an
[1676.62 → 1681.18] ssh you're in ssh you want to just be like I'm on this machine I want to copy something that's
[1681.18 → 1686.70] right oh yeah that's what I'm talking about got you I don't know if that's possible see
[1687.42 → 1693.82] see this is like you're right there you're on the machine you have a tunnel set up you just want the
[1693.82 → 1699.50] thing to transfer a freaking file, and it's like z upload is that a thing nah bro that sounds like a
[1699.50 → 1706.78] site where you download no and yes it does okay I'm just throwing it out there guys yes it does
[1707.90 → 1713.66] are you ready to move to the next thing here yes at the end of the day nobody knows what happened
[1713.66 → 1718.14] with JIRA so we're just going to have to call that one and no well we're going to have to wait and find out
[1718.78 → 1723.02] i I know but I've taught every single person I've talked to just said I have no idea I have never
[1723.02 → 1728.38] understood I don't I have no idea what they're going to do with this other than oh it's no one's gonna use
[1728.38 → 1735.26] it 100 yeah I mean it just seems confusing anyway yeah go ahead go ahead all right so this
[1735.26 → 1741.18] next section which I'm calling uh too much AI I saw this little tweet earlier and I thought that maybe
[1741.18 → 1746.94] you would like to take a little look at it yeah yeah I said I tried manually coding a feature and i just
[1746.94 → 1752.78] can't any more it's like I know how to do it, but my body simply refuses to do this manually again no matter
[1752.78 → 1754.94] how wrong the km agent will be
[1758.70 → 1762.38] that too much AI have we finally hit the peak of too much AI but hold on there's more
[1763.66 → 1768.70] this little beautiful one right here is everybody's favourite company Coinbase which is
[1768.70 → 1774.06] 40 of daily code written at Coinbase is AI generated, and they're trying to get it to 50
[1774.06 → 1782.46] 50 which honestly when I hear of a company that is based on irreversible financial uh transactions
[1782.46 → 1788.46] you know what I hope for high percentage of AI coding I was just going to say like so I am looking
[1788.46 → 1795.66] forward to the next n Coinbase hacks of which there will be many they're just generating 10 million
[1795.66 → 1802.14] like it's not going to change anything, but they're doing that that is all tailwind changes there's no
[1802.14 → 1807.58] way they're letting it have hit he literally says in the tweet on that one some code should not be AI
[1807.58 → 1812.70] generated it's surely that they have like a million vibe coders pushing forward random features on the
[1812.70 → 1817.74] front end and the dips are all plus 30 000 lines you know what I mean like that I please be the case
[1817.74 → 1823.98] Coinbase please be the case they're probably also potentially somehow considering like tab auto
[1823.98 → 1829.74] completion maybe they're like hand waving like ah 20 which is just you know like they're just saying oh
[1829.74 → 1836.30] that also counts I don't even know how someone even I mean that like a lot of a lot of code so
[1838.54 → 1843.74] I can look at a project you know on GitHub or something that was made before AI and I'm like yeah i
[1843.74 → 1848.38] could believe this was all AI generated like the coding quality is like super low right it's just
[1848.38 → 1853.42] like piles and piles and piles and piles and piles of stuff clearly Swiss cheese like if you were
[1853.42 → 1859.34] a security researcher you'd just be like well I'm getting a lot of papers out of this right um so I would
[1859.34 → 1864.78] believe it i I don't think we weren't rolling we did not roll into the AI era with high coding
[1864.78 → 1870.70] standards we rolled in with rock bottom coding standards so I believe people when they say 40
[1870.70 → 1874.46] because I'm like I can't tell the difference between the code you're writing before and the code that this
[1874.46 → 1880.22] AI is spitting out looks the same it's just complete garbage where you just pile crap on top of each other
[1880.22 → 1887.34] and duplicate code 50 million times it doesn't look different to me so i I believe people when they say
[1887.34 → 1892.30] that uh maybe they're lying but I don't think they have to be because I could believe it you know
[1894.06 → 1899.90] I don't think Coinbase is a Fort Knox of security right uh Fort Knox doesn't even have gold in it
[1899.90 → 1907.82] anymore Casey yeah yeah man actually where did all the where's the gold audit where's the Fort Knox
[1907.82 → 1912.46] gold audit trash you can look it up Bill Gates microchips have all the gold in them, they needed the gold
[1912.46 → 1917.82] for the chips for the microchips for the 5g receivers trash look up when was the last time
[1917.82 → 1922.94] we got to go see in the inside of Fort Knox the only thing I remember from Fort Knox is in die
[1922.94 → 1929.74] hard with a vengeance and that movie was awesome didn't see it I didn't see that one well the idea
[1930.54 → 1936.14] have we hit to is this too much AI have we finally hit it where people just don't even they're
[1936.14 → 1941.02] like ah because it's not like alms can just do everything so we're kind of in this weird world where
[1941.74 → 1946.46] you do have to manually code quite a few things but if everyone's just like I don't even want to do
[1946.46 → 1952.54] it is like what what does that mean what does that say for us, I mean I use AI to do like the
[1952.54 → 1959.66] stuff that's just really easy to do but what does that mean so like um all of his work
[1961.42 → 1967.98] well my job no, no but like it's time to show up to the podcast no like I'll have it like
[1967.98 → 1972.14] run like these guys doing my job right now why do you think I could be here dude i just
[1972.14 → 1978.54] shipped like 30 new features just now okay I'm getting paid and I'm shipping features no but like
[1978.54 → 1982.46] if it's just like hey test this for me and like these different scenarios or like yesterday I had to
[1982.46 → 1987.02] like test some caching stuff and I was like I gave it some like uh to-do's of like test this scenario
[1987.02 → 1991.66] for the cache and make sure the cache isn't validated it just did all the tests for me from what i
[1991.66 → 1997.50] could tell properly um or like or just like small refactor stuff that are just kind of like grunt work
[1997.50 → 2004.22] um I will always delegate that to the I like that caveat for what I could tell probably
[2004.22 → 2009.42] like I will say I told you to test the thing, and it tested the whole thing
[2010.78 → 2015.10] like I mean it was it worked for like an hour it must have done something I don't know but like
[2015.10 → 2019.34] literally like 80 of the time I'm like that's not right, and it's just like you're right I should
[2019.34 → 2022.94] so it's kind of annoying and that's some at some point I just stop and I'm just I do it myself but
[2023.58 → 2029.58] you know we'll say though trash yeah like i I'm quite a bit more willing to change like the shape
[2029.58 → 2036.94] of something if like let's say we have like 10 instances or like 10 to 30 or something like
[2036.94 → 2041.02] because I'm working on moratoria right now for our game and like sometimes we like to make enemies one
[2041.02 → 2045.50] way to start and i realize we need to change it I'm like a lot more willing to change that now than
[2045.50 → 2050.14] i used to be because i can just say like hey here i can be like you know whatever cursor or open code
[2050.14 → 2054.54] or whatever like here's the file that looks right now here's the directory of the rest of them like
[2054.54 → 2058.70] make them all look like this one that's literally what i did yeah yeah literally what i do I'm like
[2058.70 → 2064.62] here's a working example just copy it yes don't do anything else like go fix the other ones there's
[2064.62 → 2069.10] 20 of them that are the wrong way we had to like move this thing into this child thing, and now we're
[2069.10 → 2074.70] passing it here booms it's like even you sometimes know sure you could do a macro and you
[2074.70 → 2078.14] could do some other stuff like that and like i could get through quite a few of them sometimes
[2078.14 → 2082.38] like pretty quickly, but sometimes it's not quite so obvious right it's like I'm changing the name
[2082.38 → 2086.62] of something to be slightly different, and it's not really like macroable really or whatever
[2086.62 → 2095.34] uh that is an easy way to generate 5 000 lines of code exactly that is essentially zero
[2095.34 → 2101.18] in a way right because it's like it's its it's like i changed a bunch of stuff sures it's AI generated
[2101.18 → 2107.50] so it's like technically it's true, but it's really like i just ran a macro like on this thing so it's
[2107.50 → 2114.70] more like you know it's the change number of lines like for some reason we think measuring how much code AI
[2114.70 → 2120.70] writes is good by lines of code, but we would never decide whether a software developer is a good
[2120.70 → 2125.82] software developer at a company by measuring how many lines of code they did this year there's some
[2125.82 → 2129.82] stuff like did they write any like okay well they have to write something to do something good
[2130.70 → 2133.18] so there's some there are some cases where it's obvious but you wouldn't be like
[2133.82 → 2140.38] ah tom over there he wrote a hundred thousand lines last week in j diesel, and so he's really the
[2140.38 → 2148.14] guy that we love Tom's a genius you'd be like no in general it's usually the other way around so i
[2148.14 → 2156.14] would usually measure productivity by features and how few lines of code it took right so like
[2156.14 → 2160.06] if you tell me you can implement this feature in a hundred lines of code that's way better than
[2160.06 → 2165.18] someone's like oh man i put that feature and it is the AI wrote 30 000 lines of code I'm like because i see
[2165.18 → 2171.02] that a lot online and I'm like do you guys have any idea what you can do in c in 30 lines thousand
[2171.02 → 2175.50] lines of code let alone like something like python we could have a whole game inside your application
[2175.50 → 2180.70] like you literally can do an entire game engine in around 10 000 lines of code if you want to
[2180.70 → 2185.66] right and so you did 30 000 lines of code and they're like i moved this button and you're like
[2186.30 → 2191.34] what the hell is wrong with you like how is this possible so there is a lot of that where i look at the
[2191.34 → 2195.02] things that people are stating as like supposed evidence that things went well and I'm like
[2195.98 → 2201.66] that sounds terrible but again i mean i think when you roll in with such rock bottom standards
[2201.66 → 2206.54] i mean that apparently skates as something that is quoted unquote evidence that this is working well
[2206.54 → 2213.02] but sounds like it's working terribly i would love to see we have 90 of our code that's getting deleted
[2213.02 → 2218.46] is by AI yeah that's what you want going through that's what you want and it's AI bros that's what it
[2218.46 → 2226.22] should be it should be like i ran this thing on this 500 mid you know 500 000 line guitar repo and it
[2226.22 → 2231.34] reduced it to 50 000 lines and it still does all the same stuff that's the AI you actually want right
[2232.22 → 2239.18] yeah maybe can it reduce entropy that's what i want i so far I've seen it add a lot of entropy to
[2239.18 → 2244.38] my systems which sometimes it needs that's okay could still be productive and helpful or you're in
[2244.38 → 2249.58] JavaScript land and everything's entropy there's no such thing as just i have to install 37 tools to
[2249.58 → 2257.34] get through my day uh but yeah it's i would love to see more like hey 30 you know 30 of our PRS are
[2257.34 → 2263.98] code reduction PRS by AI it starts up stuff and like finds patterns that we wrote the same 37 times
[2263.98 → 2268.46] throughout the code base and wraps it up into one solves which it feels like it should be able to do but
[2268.46 → 2274.38] for some reason is not doing so i don't know like i don't really know what's going on there if it's
[2274.38 → 2280.14] just a case of like the people who are training these things don't train them properly or what i
[2280.14 → 2284.70] don't know, or maybe it's just a really hard it's a lame demo compared to one-shotting something i think
[2284.70 → 2290.30] that's one of honestly guys okay it's one of the big problems is like a lot of stuff is based on the demo
[2290.30 → 2297.74] is zero to one and not you know 38 to 42 right you know they just don't really care about 38 to 42 as much
[2297.74 → 2303.98] are these football terms because i don't know I'm saying like zero to one like the touchdown and
[2303.98 → 2310.06] yes uh no i was just zero to one like i don't have any code to like a minimum like a MVP I'm saying
[2310.06 → 2314.30] i knew that one but i didn't know the 38 to 42. I just picked two random numbers of like farther in
[2314.30 → 2320.46] the future all right yeah I still don't get it yeah that's all right just doing a scale of zero to 60.
[2320.46 → 2326.14] 60 being your I was just making up random numbers okay and hoping that they weren't a dog whistle
[2326.14 → 2330.94] code to get somewhat better like I just want things to improve and right now AI seems to be
[2330.94 → 2335.02] doing the opposite that's the thing right so I don't think they could do even what you're saying
[2335.02 → 2338.86] with the whole like find patterns and reduce it I'm not sure if AI can do that because it might
[2339.50 → 2344.22] because I'm positive if you took tree sitter, and you just said how many like similar patterns do i
[2344.22 → 2349.66] have my code base just like structurally speaking you could find patterns all over the place throughout
[2349.66 → 2354.14] your code base structurally, and it's just like what does it mean to an AI to find things of
[2354.14 → 2359.10] similar pattern or shape you might i I'm not sure if this might be actually a really hard problem
[2359.66 → 2363.34] that is not very obvious to us because for us, it's very easy to see what should be
[2364.06 → 2369.26] or I know I say that so flippantly but a lot of people get it wrong, but you get the idea that it's
[2369.26 → 2372.94] easy to look at things and be like oh I can make this more simple by moving it to here, but that's
[2372.94 → 2377.18] also one of those amazing parts about humans is it takes a hundred neurons to tell if something's
[2377.18 → 2381.74] a cat, and it takes trillions of operations for a km to see if something's a cat right it's just
[2381.74 → 2389.34] yeah well I mean the vast difference is incredible I just mean like all right I mean that could be true
[2389.34 → 2394.38] in which case AI is just doomed right but I'm like if all the people out there who are AI optimists I'm
[2394.38 → 2399.42] like you should be showing me this like show me the thing that actually does something good instead of
[2399.42 → 2406.22] the thing that always poops out poop right like um yeah encoding it feels like coding it feels like we're
[2406.22 → 2411.18] still at the thing where it like generates 17 fingers on the guy's hand in the photo right like that's
[2411.18 → 2417.26] where it feels like we're at in code and so like I want to see someone that's like no it can actually
[2417.26 → 2423.02] draw a human fairly reliably now like what get us there at some point please yeah I mean because
[2423.02 → 2427.82] people are using these tools, and they're very bad in my opinion yeah I've had good success if like
[2428.94 → 2434.78] the problem is well scoped it's in a like code base that has similar patterns and I can say like the
[2434.78 → 2438.38] one we were saying before and trash I think you've said you've done this too of just like hey
[2438.38 → 2444.46] hey i I got I changed this one I updated it now I need you to go do this in like 40 files
[2444.46 → 2450.46] just go spend some tokens burn some electricity and solve this for me like that actually has worked
[2450.46 → 2458.38] really well for me, and it is nice because it oh it like frees me up to fix my previous mistakes
[2458.38 → 2464.22] right in the sense I like sometimes you'd be like it's just not really worth it to like to go and change
[2464.22 → 2467.02] the structure of this because you're going to go find all the places and do all this stuff if you can
[2467.02 → 2473.02] just be like go find all the places and fix those for me uh it's nice so I've also I've used it like
[2473.02 → 2477.98] for a wide range of stuff but I do think people would be like better served by showing real examples
[2477.98 → 2484.22] of like I pointed at this code base, and it reduced 2000 lines of code that for me, I would be like that's
[2484.22 → 2492.06] awesome I would be way more excited about your project yeah it feels like it would be very useful and
[2492.06 → 2497.34] what is more needed like uh on in a lot of these projects that I see like they're they're just when
[2497.34 → 2501.26] I look at them, I'm like okay you guys literally took like 10 000 lines of code to do
[2501.26 → 2504.86] something that's like literally 100 lines of code just because no one really knew what's going on and i
[2505.66 → 2511.50] maybe that's something AIs can't do in the near term but it kind of doesn't feel
[2512.78 → 2516.14] it doesn't feel like that should be the case I just feel like they probably just don't have good
[2516.14 → 2520.86] training sets to like they probably just don't have a way to really train it to do that right now
[2520.86 → 2526.62] but you know that was one of the things um we didn't get to it last uh last episode but like
[2527.82 → 2534.54] uh I think honestly the not one of things people are underestimating about the training data on GitHub
[2534.54 → 2541.74] is not just that you have code there but that you can actually see the changes over time and like
[2541.74 → 2548.30] training on diffs and other stuff like that right or uh recently I saw an article where uh open AI
[2548.30 → 2553.02] maybe in Microsoft or someone else I don't know was thinking about licensing like cursor edits or
[2553.02 → 2558.14] something for people who have like that turned on or whatever like yeah because it needs to see that
[2558.14 → 2563.18] but of course the problem is if everyone is doing the thing that I'm complaining about which is hey i
[2563.18 → 2568.86] just spammed out 10 000 lines of code to move the button over here or whatever then that means that AI
[2568.86 → 2574.86] learns that way and that's a problem right so and I don't know how you fix that problem other than
[2574.86 → 2579.26] you have to shift the way that you're doing your AI to one that's more of an adversarial training
[2579.26 → 2584.06] process like more like an alpha go kind of a thing yeah which I guess they just haven't really quite
[2584.62 → 2589.42] gotten enough of that into the process yet or whatever I'm going to be I'm still going to have a job
[2589.42 → 2594.54] writing code later because they're gonna just be paying me to write code to train AI off me see so
[2594.54 → 2600.22] that's that's my job security Casey do you think it's going to be like a a boutique thing in
[2600.22 → 2606.94] the future where it's like uh you're you kind of like have a officially licensed like kind of
[2606.94 → 2612.78] like you know you have officially licensed sport like a is Michael Jordan's shoe it's like this
[2612.78 → 2619.66] is TJ's like you know AI that you use, and it programs like him or whatever, or you can be like him
[2619.66 → 2625.10] when you program we should do that I want trash I want trash as my coding buddy the whole time he's
[2625.10 → 2629.66] like great work let's eat a Doritos you know what I mean I'm like yeah I want to be the modern day
[2629.66 → 2634.30] Clippy all right there you go can you just imagine me like can you imagine me just in the bottom right
[2634.30 → 2639.66] here in your corner it's like dude that's sick trash we need to make that we actually need to make
[2639.66 → 2646.78] that it looks like we're trying to be incredibly baller go for it, you know what you deserve a Doritos
[2646.78 → 2651.82] let's go all right i have to go to jujitsu I'll be right back, and then it just disappears for like
[2651.82 → 2657.18] two hours don't ask for me for like a couple of hours i have to go work out and there's a little silhouette
[2657.18 → 2661.58] of it like going like doing all this stuff and like throwing the dude across your desktop dancing
[2661.58 → 2667.66] avatars on Windows when they had those like you could have the dancing avatars yeah oh man
[2668.38 → 2673.90] well that stuff has evolved now you know that right like yeah there's an entire market of idle games
[2673.90 → 2678.78] that run down in the taskbar basically like yeah on the bottom of your Windows desktop so
[2678.78 → 2683.74] you know that that could be where that could be where trash is ultimately headed yeah I like that
[2683.74 → 2689.74] trash we can make that happen we can immortalize you true trash idlers a new genre of trash
[2690.94 → 2696.06] all right so I'm going to attempt to steal man some of the AI I think things that has been flowing
[2696.06 → 2701.50] through a lot of like the armies thought process on this all which is that computers are fast
[2701.50 → 2708.14] enough to process a lot of code, and we call these things like tech debt or poorly written code but
[2708.14 → 2713.34] if an AI can fix the poorly written code, and it doesn't matter how many times it's copied it doesn't
[2713.34 → 2718.06] matter about all that if it just keeps on abstracting you away, and it's just able to take care of all of
[2718.06 → 2723.34] those headaches it doesn't matter if the diff was 10 lines or a thousand lines because at the end of the
[2723.34 → 2730.86] the day computers are fast enough, and we should be able to produce out the exact uh like feature set
[2730.86 → 2735.42] we want regardless of the quality of the code and when I need to refactor I don't think about
[2735.42 → 2740.30] refactoring I'm just like hey update this, and it goes, and it finds all the places, and it does either
[2740.30 → 2746.14] the manually updating or maybe god forbid it is reduces entropy and does some sort of refactoring
[2746.14 → 2750.46] but at the end of the day it's just like no that's not a problem that's not that's not the way we
[2750.46 → 2754.94] think about things well there are several problems with it right the very first one and most important
[2754.94 → 2759.82] one for this domain is security because the more lines of code you have the more exploits you have
[2759.82 → 2766.22] almost always right so that's problem a because we're talking about a lot of times we're talking
[2766.22 → 2771.18] about like web development stuff so it's not like a video game or something where you're just running it
[2771.18 → 2775.58] in some situation where maybe you just don't care because it's like completely you know it's on the
[2775.58 → 2782.70] PlayStation, and it's completely isolated processor whatever who knows um thing two is performance is
[2782.70 → 2787.26] already abysmal I mean I'm already sitting here I click a button and I wait you know like sometimes
[2787.26 → 2791.66] this is a good thought by the way i this is just me trying to steel man as much as possible
[2791.66 → 2796.86] the problem is computers aren't fast enough they just aren't we've still managed to slow them down
[2796.86 → 2803.82] and the problem is the way in which they slow down right now is very very very tied to the structure of
[2803.82 → 2809.98] what you're doing so if you have your AI's generating all these like server round trips
[2809.98 → 2815.82] or whatever because that implements the feature well your customers will be waiting longer and longer
[2815.82 → 2822.70] and longer to click the button or to open up the app or all the other things which people claim is fine
[2822.70 → 2827.18] but whenever anyone does a study they find that like every additional hundred milliseconds costs
[2827.18 → 2834.94] them money like cost them actual revenue right and so it's not okay right it's not okay to sacrifice
[2834.94 → 2840.30] performance because it actually not only does it ruin everything for everybody who actually uses your
[2840.30 → 2845.42] software, but it actually does end up hurting you in the long run too so that's a problem thing number
[2845.42 → 2852.94] three is wait where is the electricity coming from someone still needs to explain where the electricity is
[2852.94 → 2859.90] coming from right lightning okay come on I was going to say Zeus what are you talking about dude that's
[2859.90 → 2865.02] how we get our electricity we just get lightning i I want i really still at some point want to hear
[2865.02 → 2868.54] what they're just coming it's going to be building more nuclear power plants I guess I'm not sure
[2868.54 → 2873.58] because obviously like we've had this whole push of like everyone in Silicon Valley is falling all over
[2873.58 → 2877.74] themselves to tell us what great people they are and how wonderful they are and how they're on the right
[2877.74 → 2883.58] side of all these social causes, and they're like also by the way we're going to use roughly the power
[2883.58 → 2889.10] consumption of Germany for all of our data centre things added up right I mean I think Germany is like
[2889.10 → 2896.22] 60 gigawatts and AI data one AI data centre is one gigawatt can I give you a fun fact yeah I did a little
[2896.22 → 2904.14] bit of research on this so to fly a fully loaded jet from la to New York yeah happens about 22 to 26 times a
[2904.14 → 2912.06] day okay it would take approximately 183 days of full flights back and forth to equal one day of
[2912.06 → 2919.90] ChatGPT yeah processing power in gpt5 it's not good right this is not good yeah so every two days
[2919.90 → 2925.74] is a year worth of burning that much stuff when I walked back to the future though he just did it
[2925.74 → 2930.30] like in his car he made a lot of Jack watts Casey so like I don't understand what the concern is well
[2930.30 → 2934.62] the concern is just like where it's going to come from, and maybe the answer is like the the build
[2934.62 → 2938.94] more nuclear power plants or something which might be fine, but that is not happening currently so i
[2938.94 → 2942.94] don't know is it just burning coal or something which is not going to be a good outcome right
[2943.58 → 2946.38] the thing along dinosaur juice clean out of the ground buddy
[2951.02 → 2956.86] people want dinosaurs back so if we put it all back in the air we can have dinosaurs again we can
[2956.86 → 2961.42] make the planet warm enough for dinosaurs again this is the whole point of the whole thing right
[2961.42 → 2966.14] in the movie the dinosaurs die at the end and then Scarlett Johansson has to go to an island and save
[2966.14 → 2974.30] people I would love to see a dinosaur like in ChatGPT you remember same guy in a little bit of trouble
[2974.30 → 2979.74] with that I don't what happened he tried to clone he asked if Scarlett Johansson wanted to be the voice
[2979.74 → 2986.30] of ChatGPT she said no so we got a copy, and then it was like oh we didn't get you we got someone else
[2986.30 → 2990.94] that was like the beginning of the whole AI craze okay my serious thing I want to say about what
[2990.94 → 2999.82] you were saying Casey too is that uh like it even if you think AI is still going to write all your
[2999.82 → 3005.18] code it's actually better if AI can do it more concisely for regular people because you're going
[3005.18 → 3012.54] to pay by the token but that actually leaves a perverse incentive it sure does AI companies who at
[3012.54 → 3018.86] least for people training models I think like cursor would prefer you to take less tokens because
[3018.86 → 3025.34] they don't want to have to charge you more money right but like open AI they like yes all the
[3025.34 → 3031.26] code takes a lot of tokens, and it churns a lot all the time because then they say excellent your entire
[3031.26 → 3037.50] business depends on you sending this back to me, and you don't know what to do with it so they're like
[3037.50 → 3043.10] like they have a very perverse incentive actually to like well we'll just keep pushing the context
[3043.10 → 3048.14] window bigger that's really what you need you really need two million tokens of context and load
[3048.14 → 3052.78] that bad boy upload it up you know like which also means that they have agent problems too right
[3052.78 → 3056.54] oh you know what we need the agents are going to get extra smart they're going to double-check every
[3056.54 → 3064.70] file right yeah I would also point out that unlike so one of the nice things about a current data centre
[3064.70 → 3069.26] like if you were just looking at like a data centre that you built for I don't know AWS or something
[3070.46 → 3077.98] or a Google data centre for the most part they're pretty multipurpose like you can do lots of
[3077.98 → 3083.42] different stuff with it, you know you can, you could run some really slick very custom very efficient
[3083.42 → 3088.06] application on it that was written to bare metal or whatever you want right you could do all kinds of
[3088.06 → 3093.90] stuff, or you can run like 12 layers of bloated python you could do whatever you want right and the data
[3093.90 → 3098.86] centre will just they're pretty general purpose and there might be certain use cases that they're
[3098.86 → 3104.38] maybe not optimal for, but it's it we can, it can adapt right and so all of us out there can use it
[3104.38 → 3110.46] for various reasons an AI dentist centre can only do one thing and one thing only and that is low
[3110.46 → 3115.34] precision matrix multiplies that's basically it like it's not going to do anything else well it's not
[3115.34 → 3120.78] going to be power efficient doing anything else it's going to be very power hungry uh if you were to run
[3120.78 → 3125.58] anything else on it because most of the equipment in it and the entire structure and like it's liquid
[3125.58 → 3129.90] cooled right is it's not going to be air cooled like a normal data centre blah blah blah I mean there's
[3129.90 → 3133.82] some there are some data centres that are liquid cooled but either way I'm saying like they're designed
[3133.82 → 3138.70] totally differently, and they have way more power being pushed through them because that's how AI you
[3138.70 → 3144.22] know AI is a very sustained high load kind of thing so we're also building out a tremendous amount
[3144.22 → 3149.74] of infrastructure that's completely useless for anything else but this and that also sucks in my
[3149.74 → 3154.22] opinion because what if this turns out to not be that great what if we find there's a much better
[3154.22 → 3159.90] way to be doing this stuff like what happens to all of this build out so that's not very encouraging
[3159.90 → 3163.26] either in my opinion but I guess you know their answer is just well we'll just build more data so
[3163.26 → 3168.46] like all right I mean I don't know it's its just I don't love this kind of stuff I like general
[3168.46 → 3174.62] purpose computing I don't like this hyper specialized kind of thing, but that's where we're at confirmed
[3174.62 → 3184.86] Casey likes python 12 layers of things over Cuba got it confirmed I mean but i I hate to say it
[3185.50 → 3191.98] but actually yes like oh we got that's kind of true like i love GPUs and I love GPU programming
[3191.98 → 3196.46] I think that's very interesting if you're a gamer, and you bought one was that better software conference
[3197.18 → 3203.02] you're not inviting Casey back this year yeah exactly but I love the fact that the data centre can do that
[3203.02 → 3210.70] I love that yes i yeah I absolutely hate the fact that I have to use code that's 16 layers of
[3210.70 → 3216.78] python deep or whatever right but I absolutely love the fact that that worked and an AI data centre
[3216.78 → 3224.54] literally cannot run that it would just roll over and die right so you know ask the AI to evaluate it
[3224.54 → 3230.30] and guess what the output would be I mean I shouldn't say it can't run it I mean obviously it can run it is
[3230.30 → 3235.18] it can run it is just costs so much more power to run it is the right way to say it right it's like
[3235.18 → 3244.46] it's not like it can't it's just it's so much less efficient yeah so well that was pretty neat
[3246.54 → 3250.46] okay it's a cool story it's a cool story do you I agree with you but hey guess what I think that
[3250.46 → 3257.18] means we're done for the day huh signing off for Friday signing out for Friday see you later great Friday
[3257.18 → 3264.14] everyone
[3264.14 → 3269.14] Terminal Coffee and Hero
[3269.14 → 3271.14] Living the Dream
