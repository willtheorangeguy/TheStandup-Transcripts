[0.00 → 3.28] Today is a very special episode of The Stand-Up.
[3.52 → 9.28] Trash Dev, Casey Juratory, Siege, and me give away a lot of money provided by Planet Scale,
[9.38 → 12.88] plus the magnanimous Twitch chat, the sales from the arch sweater,
[13.10 → 17.94] and a little bit extra, we end up giving away $50,000 to our favourite open source projects.
[18.38 → 21.90] So have a Merry Christmas, and I hope you enjoy The Stand-Up.
[22.22 → 25.70] And thanks again to Planet Scale for making open source Santa possible.
[26.22 → 27.84] Yeah, Trash, why didn't you dress up, by the way?
[28.64 → 29.62] What do you mean?
[30.00 → 30.74] He is, dude.
[30.74 → 31.18] Look at this.
[31.22 → 31.86] That's pretty good.
[31.98 → 33.58] Do you see these reindeers and snowflakes?
[34.06 → 35.50] Yeah, it's like, okay.
[35.66 → 37.28] Like, TJ obviously went to town.
[38.04 → 39.04] I obviously went to town.
[39.04 → 41.20] Oh, Santa Claus is coming to town, boys.
[41.28 → 42.74] TJ went the most to town.
[42.80 → 43.36] Check me out.
[43.64 → 44.16] Check me out.
[44.28 → 46.06] I mean, you can, I'm surprised it's showing.
[46.24 → 47.10] I had to spend the whole morning.
[47.10 → 48.18] I can see through your ribcage.
[52.62 → 54.84] Welcome to The Stand-Up.
[54.84 → 59.90] Today we have a very special Christmas episode where Planet Scale has given us
[59.90 → 64.66] $30,000 to give away, and we'll be doing more giving away on top of it.
[65.22 → 70.02] But to kind of explain the basics of the rule is that Planet Scale said, hey, we want you
[70.02 → 71.80] to do an open source Santa kind of giveaway.
[71.94 → 75.74] So we sat down and thought about it, and we figured the best way to do that is that each
[75.74 → 78.18] one of the hosts get $5,000 to give away.
[78.18 → 81.98] If you happen to be in Twitch chat at the end of this, I'm going to ask Twitch chat what
[81.98 → 83.14] are their favourite open sources.
[83.48 → 88.06] I'll see which one is which, and then chat will do a vote on the final four, and we'll
[88.06 → 92.14] give another $5,000 to that open source, and we'll do the same thing with YouTube.
[92.50 → 96.04] And then we have one to two bonus surprises at the end.
[96.38 → 96.66] Yes.
[96.66 → 101.92] I hate to interrupt, but Trash, your munching is so loud right now.
[101.92 → 102.88] Wait, I'm muted.
[103.30 → 105.28] Josh, it's a separate audio source.
[105.86 → 106.60] Was I not muted?
[107.26 → 108.72] No, but it's a separate audio source.
[108.78 → 109.80] It's a separate audio source.
[109.94 → 111.56] It's okay, because in post, you can take it out.
[111.94 → 113.12] Here's what I will say, though.
[113.54 → 117.78] Although, in theory, in post, you can take it out, I don't think I've yet to watch a
[117.78 → 119.96] stand-up where I couldn't hear Trash is eating.
[120.00 → 121.88] I don't think it is getting taken out in post.
[122.12 → 124.52] It's just going to hypothetically be taken out in post.
[124.52 → 126.52] I was watching it the other day, and I'm just hearing like...
[127.26 → 128.94] Yes.
[129.16 → 130.22] It's hard to do.
[130.34 → 132.70] It's hard to do, because then we have to go back and forth all the time.
[132.76 → 133.96] It makes it take a lot longer.
[134.36 → 135.36] I thought it was muted.
[135.44 → 136.08] It said muted.
[136.16 → 137.16] Is this a Riverside bug?
[137.24 → 137.66] I swear.
[138.16 → 138.76] I muted it.
[138.92 → 140.32] Well, you were not muted, Trash.
[140.38 → 140.80] That's fine.
[140.98 → 141.36] That's fine.
[141.80 → 147.24] I would like to apologize on behalf of everyone else, because you were crushing that intro until
[147.24 → 150.94] Tee just came in and absolutely stomped on your phone.
[150.94 → 152.12] Dude, I'm Santa's helper.
[152.26 → 153.98] I have to stop him and let him know.
[153.98 → 154.58] It's important.
[154.58 → 159.18] He's a backseat driver is what it seems like, because I was in there doing great work out
[159.18 → 159.68] there.
[159.76 → 161.08] It's a left, bro.
[161.20 → 161.62] It's a left.
[161.62 → 168.20] It's like, in my mind, Santa slides down the chimney, and he's really quietly putting the
[168.20 → 172.14] presents under the tree, so the kids don't know, and he's got it, and he's eating the
[172.14 → 173.72] little cookie and drinking the milk.
[174.16 → 176.48] And then one of his elves is like, hey, Santa!
[176.48 → 176.60] Yeah!
[177.02 → 181.90] I don't know if the sleigh might be a little uneven up on the roof.
[181.90 → 183.50] Did you forget the parking break?
[183.50 → 186.34] Everyone in the house is like, oh my god, intruder, what's happening?
[186.52 → 187.68] Then Santa gets shot.
[188.08 → 188.30] Okay.
[188.50 → 189.08] That's what happens to you.
[189.08 → 189.48] Yeah, exactly.
[189.48 → 189.60] Seriously.
[190.56 → 191.54] I have to tell you guys something.
[191.72 → 194.02] I am sweating so hard in this one.
[194.30 → 194.80] Oh my god.
[195.20 → 197.40] My belly button is like a little pulley pull.
[198.04 → 199.52] Are you still on jiu-jitsu?
[199.70 → 201.00] You're on jiu-jitsu cool down?
[201.78 → 203.26] I did jiu-jitsu this morning.
[203.58 → 204.74] Yes, you're still overheated.
[204.80 → 205.78] You're overheated from the jiu-jitsu.
[206.20 → 207.28] Your boy is, woo!
[207.98 → 208.62] Stinky stink.
[208.78 → 209.28] All right, let's go.
[209.44 → 210.12] Intro, let's go.
[210.50 → 210.86] All right.
[210.88 → 211.06] Sorry.
[211.26 → 212.20] I think we did an intro.
[212.46 → 213.36] I don't know if we really...
[213.36 → 214.10] Do we need another one?
[214.98 → 217.56] All right, I'll re-explain it just in case anybody did not catch it.
[217.56 → 217.86] Yeah, sorry.
[217.86 → 218.90] This is for the live stream.
[219.08 → 222.00] I think we could just have it nicely done in post, but I'll re-explain it either way.
[222.20 → 223.06] Pick which one, Josh.
[223.12 → 223.78] Whatever one you want.
[224.14 → 227.10] All right, so today's stream is, of course, sponsored by Planet Scale.
[227.16 → 231.40] They have given us $30,000 to give away to open source specifically.
[231.94 → 235.54] And we're going to be doing a couple extra bonus giveaways at the very end.
[235.60 → 236.30] Very exciting.
[236.80 → 239.84] First off, we had to figure out how do we give away this $30,000.
[239.84 → 244.86] So I decided that Casey Murat ore, Trash, and TJ each get $5,000.
[245.34 → 246.20] I get $5,000.
[246.64 → 248.10] Twitch chat will get $5,000.
[248.26 → 250.02] And YouTube chat will get $5,000.
[250.10 → 254.06] We all get to decide what open source projects get a chunk of money.
[254.22 → 256.04] And you're probably asking yourself, $5,000?
[256.20 → 258.70] Why not give 30 open source projects $1,000?
[259.42 → 262.80] That was originally my suggestion too, but TJ convinced me of something different,
[263.22 → 267.58] which is if we give a bunch of projects $1,000, that could be very, very nice for a couple
[267.58 → 268.00] individuals.
[268.00 → 272.24] But if we give them $5,000, that could actually pay for real open source work and hopefully
[272.24 → 273.86] push the project slightly forward.
[273.94 → 278.18] Now, we're all doing our part out here, so you guys can join in because every single sub
[278.18 → 281.92] gifted either on YouTube or Twitch will also be going to charity.
[282.08 → 283.98] And that specific charity will be Neovim.
[284.30 → 286.54] And so Neovim will be getting all that good right there.
[286.94 → 289.54] And then we have one extra super bonus at the very end.
[290.30 → 290.66] True.
[291.16 → 291.46] True.
[291.86 → 292.38] All true.
[292.78 → 293.84] Great, great intro.
[294.32 → 294.98] First try.
[294.98 → 297.82] The name is the nitrogen.
[299.12 → 303.20] We should probably end the podcast right now because it's all downhill from there.
[303.98 → 304.28] All right.
[304.34 → 306.02] So who's going to go first?
[306.12 → 307.60] And by the way, Trash, if you say type hero.
[308.46 → 308.98] All right.
[309.04 → 309.78] I'm just going to let you know.
[309.78 → 310.62] That's so funny.
[310.72 → 311.12] If you say type hero.
[312.32 → 314.56] You're not allowed to be in your own project, people.
[315.06 → 317.16] Come in next day with my Pokémon collection even bigger.
[319.20 → 320.00] I like that.
[320.16 → 320.28] Yeah.
[320.94 → 323.68] Trash, by the way, the Pokémon collection looking great behind you.
[323.68 → 325.24] Can I just say before we get started?
[326.52 → 327.26] It looks good.
[327.82 → 328.14] Wow.
[328.20 → 328.80] That's a lot of Pokémon.
[329.08 → 329.10] Wait.
[329.18 → 330.02] It's going to get bigger and bigger.
[330.02 → 331.92] Do you keep it all boxed and cellophane?
[331.92 → 333.12] I'll keep it all sealed right now.
[333.90 → 334.76] Let's keep them all sealed.
[334.90 → 336.12] And then I don't know what I'm going to do with them.
[336.14 → 336.66] We'll find out.
[336.70 → 337.30] He's investing, bro.
[337.30 → 338.44] It's called New and Shrink, bro.
[338.44 → 338.66] Yeah.
[338.82 → 339.06] It's called New and Shrink.
[339.06 → 340.26] This is a college fund right here.
[340.26 → 340.64] New and Shrink.
[340.66 → 341.10] That's what that is.
[342.18 → 342.46] Okay.
[343.62 → 344.84] I think Trash should go first.
[344.90 → 346.06] I'm excited to hear who he picks.
[346.12 → 346.68] Do you want me to go first?
[347.00 → 347.24] Yes.
[347.32 → 347.58] Yeah.
[347.86 → 348.14] Okay.
[348.46 → 349.12] Hit us, Trash.
[349.12 → 350.10] I'll be honest.
[350.22 → 353.30] It was, I couldn't think of anybody.
[353.50 → 358.88] And the projects I could think of were already super popular, have a lot of supporters already.
[360.14 → 364.84] So then I sat back, and I was thinking about what projects or what tools have I used where
[364.84 → 369.02] I actually interacted with the creator and or went to their community and asked for help.
[370.54 → 375.18] So I brought this up a couple of podcasts ago when I was talking about what I was working
[375.18 → 375.48] on.
[375.48 → 376.72] And I was working on a test framework.
[376.72 → 381.22] And we built this test framework off of this library called Mock Service Worker.
[382.28 → 386.22] And I remember when I first started using it, I was like a little confused, but like
[386.22 → 389.52] I was trying to do stuff that wasn't really like, it's kind of off the beaten path.
[389.60 → 391.50] So it's not really examples or anything like that.
[391.54 → 392.50] So I jumped into the Discord.
[393.36 → 396.18] And then the I think the person who created it, his name is Artem.
[396.66 → 401.58] He was in the Discord, and he answered my message immediately, jumped in my DMs.
[401.60 → 402.38] We were talking DMs.
[402.40 → 405.26] And then we also like jumped on a call, and he was kind of like helping me.
[405.26 → 409.50] And then I did my due diligence, had like a GitHub repo where he could actually see the
[409.50 → 410.76] code with my problem.
[410.82 → 412.52] And then he made a pull request and fixed it.
[413.18 → 414.82] And he was just like always so attentive.
[415.00 → 416.12] Like I know this dude's like busy.
[416.22 → 417.08] There's a lot of people in Discord.
[418.20 → 421.50] But like the fact that he jumped on a call with me, answered all my dumb questions, even
[421.50 → 423.78] read the docs of like another library that I was using.
[424.16 → 425.86] And like, here's a link to the docs.
[425.92 → 427.30] He's like, you need to use this API instead.
[427.30 → 429.86] And so like he did his due diligence, like reading all this stuff.
[429.90 → 430.62] And it was crazy.
[430.66 → 434.08] And it was like such a genuine like experience with this person.
[435.08 → 436.44] And it really left an impact on me.
[436.48 → 440.10] And I was like, dude, if I can help you anywhere I can, like I know we use you on Netflix.
[440.26 → 442.30] Maybe we can maybe do something with that.
[442.32 → 442.80] I don't know.
[442.80 → 447.82] So when this came across my thing and I remember that, I was like, this is like the perfect
[447.82 → 449.14] opportunity to give back to Artem.
[449.20 → 453.08] I know Artem left his job to do like full-time education and work on his work.
[453.28 → 456.18] I know he does like stuff for like Epic Web, I think with Kenzie Dodds, maybe.
[457.12 → 459.22] So I know this would really go a long way from him.
[459.38 → 461.10] So Artem, if you're in here, I'm not sure if I didn't tell you.
[461.14 → 461.86] I didn't want to spoil it.
[462.54 → 464.08] But I'll reach out to you directly later.
[464.50 → 465.26] But yeah, you're awesome.
[465.52 → 466.18] Thank you for everything.
[466.38 → 466.80] You're the best.
[467.44 → 468.66] Trash, give us some links.
[468.76 → 469.34] We need to know.
[469.56 → 471.34] So what's this mock service worker thing?
[471.40 → 472.30] Where can we find it on GitHub?
[472.30 → 475.26] So it's going to be, I'll just link it in chat.
[475.36 → 477.94] It's going to be mswjs.io.
[480.06 → 480.46] Nice.
[480.72 → 482.94] So it's like perfect for like mocking calls and stuff.
[483.08 → 483.58] It's amazing.
[483.78 → 484.50] Amazing, amazing.
[486.48 → 486.88] Awesome.
[487.48 → 488.20] Thanks, Trash.
[488.52 → 489.26] Yeah, yeah.
[489.64 → 494.70] By the way, Sam just posted in the chat that the first 50 people to use this specific link
[494.70 → 499.14] that I've put in both YouTube and in Twitch will get $20 of Planet Scale credits.
[499.62 → 500.38] So I made sure it's pinned.
[500.46 → 501.56] You guys should know where it's at.
[501.56 → 502.10] There you go.
[502.96 → 504.30] The gift that keeps on giving.
[504.70 → 505.34] Planet Scale's great.
[505.46 → 506.38] I use it all the time.
[506.42 → 507.22] I'm a paying customer.
[508.08 → 508.88] Wow, nice.
[508.88 → 508.98] Nice.
[508.98 → 510.58] Us too, actually, at Terminal.
[510.82 → 512.02] That's what we've been running the whole time.
[512.30 → 512.84] There you go.
[513.88 → 514.30] All right.
[515.58 → 516.68] That was lovely.
[516.94 → 517.28] Trash.
[517.88 → 518.84] I like that, Trash.
[518.84 → 519.84] That was an unexpected one.
[519.84 → 521.72] Was that like a nice heartfelt message?
[521.80 → 522.12] Yeah.
[522.54 → 523.38] I like that.
[523.38 → 524.38] I'm a good guy.
[524.38 → 528.82] I just want to chat when I say that you've touched all of them with that story.
[529.10 → 529.60] You're welcome.
[529.60 → 531.68] Is that in School of Rock where he goes?
[532.92 → 534.56] I have touched your children.
[534.92 → 535.14] Yes.
[535.66 → 536.16] Yeah.
[538.16 → 540.10] We are turning this conversation a different way.
[540.10 → 541.66] I like to think that they've touched me.
[544.14 → 545.68] It's a very, very good.
[546.30 → 547.32] That movie's great.
[547.84 → 549.46] I forgot how funny that movie is.
[550.06 → 551.26] That movie just changed.
[551.26 → 557.34] It's like any movie where you get to start a band and then play a show is always good
[557.34 → 558.00] in my book.
[558.78 → 560.00] It's always the dream.
[560.24 → 561.40] The drummer dream growing up.
[561.40 → 562.50] That's why that thing you do.
[562.70 → 563.38] Top tier movie.
[564.08 → 568.98] This is TJ's 30% of his suggestions at Terminal whenever we're talking about new media.
[569.22 → 569.58] That thing you do.
[569.58 → 572.00] He's always like, okay, well, what if we did a country music video?
[572.20 → 575.08] What happened if we all got together as a band and did a country music video?
[575.16 → 575.76] I'm just saying.
[575.86 → 576.56] What happened if we did that?
[578.14 → 578.74] It'd be good.
[578.80 → 579.42] That's what I'm saying.
[579.70 → 580.60] We need to play a show.
[580.60 → 581.68] We need to play a terminal.
[582.02 → 585.72] We need to play the stand-up show.
[586.12 → 587.14] We each play an instrument.
[587.20 → 588.52] Beacon can play guitar.
[588.64 → 589.40] TJ can play drums.
[589.64 → 590.20] Stand-up bass.
[590.70 → 591.28] I'm keyboard.
[592.14 → 594.98] But Casey, you'd have to sing as well because you do a little bit of singing, don't you?
[595.40 → 596.46] Not really, no.
[596.70 → 597.46] He's a great singer.
[597.60 → 601.42] Don't we have anyone else who really does singing, like rock singing?
[602.18 → 603.64] Trash, you were in a band.
[604.00 → 605.32] That doesn't mean I'm good.
[605.50 → 607.40] Anybody can be in a band, right?
[607.48 → 608.70] We could start a band right now.
[608.74 → 609.68] That doesn't mean I'm good.
[609.68 → 610.62] That's what I'm saying.
[610.72 → 612.30] We could all be in a band right now.
[612.78 → 613.24] We could.
[613.68 → 614.74] We could be in a band.
[614.84 → 615.30] That's true.
[616.56 → 617.74] I'll play marimba.
[618.64 → 619.44] Or drums.
[619.56 → 620.06] I'll play either one.
[620.50 → 623.14] You could play drums and marimba same time.
[623.94 → 624.26] Marimba.
[625.00 → 627.16] That would be really hard to do, but I would try it.
[627.36 → 628.90] For the stand-up, I would try it.
[629.08 → 629.58] What's a marimba?
[629.58 → 631.04] You could just go like, snare.
[631.04 → 631.16] Snare.
[631.66 → 632.02] Snare?
[632.16 → 633.66] What's a marimba?
[633.66 → 634.22] What's a marimba?
[634.82 → 635.10] Yeah.
[635.44 → 636.74] Never heard that word in my life.
[637.04 → 637.42] The xylophone?
[637.42 → 637.60] The xylophone?
[638.10 → 639.50] Oh, is that big xylophone thing?
[639.80 → 641.72] It's a huge xylophone.
[641.84 → 642.30] What do you mean?
[643.08 → 644.10] Why don't we just call it xylophone?
[644.24 → 644.72] Just bigger.
[644.98 → 646.06] Xylophone is not the...
[646.06 → 648.82] That's like saying, why not just call our guitars?
[649.48 → 650.22] That doesn't make any sense.
[650.26 → 650.46] Yeah.
[650.54 → 651.62] I mean, it does make sense.
[651.86 → 652.46] A big guitar.
[652.70 → 653.12] A violin?
[653.36 → 654.14] Just a small guitar.
[654.14 → 656.98] Well, that's completely different, okay?
[657.16 → 657.64] That is different.
[657.68 → 659.28] I feel like that's just a big xylophone, okay?
[659.52 → 660.70] Just call everyone singers.
[660.90 → 662.40] There's no treble or bass singers.
[662.74 → 662.86] All right.
[662.86 → 663.52] I'm sorry.
[663.70 → 665.78] I offended all xylophone players in the world.
[665.84 → 666.70] All 10 of you, okay?
[668.02 → 668.42] Wow.
[669.30 → 670.16] Trash, you know what?
[670.28 → 673.02] I'm going to find out what band it was you were in.
[673.16 → 673.94] No, please not.
[674.20 → 679.00] Someone actually tagged me with the name on Twitter, and I was mortified.
[679.00 → 679.48] Okay.
[679.88 → 683.90] To be fair to Trash, am I wrong in thinking that when you, like,
[683.90 → 688.80] look at orchestra, it's just like the marimba is just under percussion.
[689.36 → 691.60] Like, it doesn't even get its own player.
[691.84 → 692.64] It's like percussion.
[693.10 → 694.08] That's true for all percussion.
[694.42 → 694.68] Yeah.
[694.94 → 699.24] So it's like Trash is not doing any worse by lumping it with xylophone.
[700.18 → 701.18] I'm just doing what everyone's thinking.
[701.18 → 701.94] But that's...
[701.94 → 706.44] It's correctly classified under percussion, but not correctly classified under xylophone.
[706.44 → 707.12] How big are the little...
[707.12 → 707.84] Okay, all right.
[707.84 → 709.76] How big are your little drumsticks that you hit it with?
[709.94 → 710.40] Oh, my gosh.
[710.40 → 711.00] They're big mallets.
[711.32 → 712.28] The mallets are pretty big.
[712.44 → 712.84] Mallets?
[712.84 → 713.84] That's like a...
[713.84 → 714.00] What?
[714.10 → 715.64] They're called mallets, Trash.
[716.18 → 717.54] Don't you use mallets to hit mails?
[717.54 → 717.90] They're this size right here.
[719.06 → 721.90] That is a lot smaller than I thought they were going to be.
[722.14 → 722.46] Really?
[722.60 → 723.24] Trash, you want me to...
[723.24 → 723.94] I'll play...
[723.94 → 725.16] You want me to play something right now?
[725.22 → 725.74] We'll just do a quick...
[725.74 → 726.52] Yes, of course we do.
[726.68 → 727.82] Everyone wants you to do that.
[727.82 → 729.48] We're supposed to be an open source, but we'll do a quick marimba.
[729.74 → 730.88] We'll just take this out.
[730.96 → 732.42] This will be in the extended episode on Spotify.
[732.58 → 733.48] Are you kidding me?
[733.54 → 734.18] This is going...
[734.18 → 734.90] This is going on YouTube.
[735.00 → 737.06] You think I'm going to miss my chance to shine here?
[737.16 → 737.34] Here.
[737.82 → 738.06] All right.
[738.10 → 738.24] Here.
[738.40 → 738.84] We're going to all...
[738.84 → 741.10] Teen's been waiting for this moment.
[741.84 → 743.16] His whole streak.
[743.94 → 744.88] I've been waiting for this moment.
[745.16 → 746.56] All my life.
[746.80 → 747.72] You got to turn the camera.
[748.28 → 748.46] Yeah.
[748.62 → 748.82] I know.
[748.90 → 749.14] I am.
[749.18 → 749.42] I am.
[749.46 → 749.68] I am.
[749.68 → 749.92] I am.
[749.92 → 750.16] I am.
[750.16 → 750.38] I am.
[750.56 → 752.20] You can't really see very much right now, though.
[752.20 → 754.12] I have to move this completely, too.
[754.80 → 755.64] We can see it.
[755.74 → 756.30] We can see just fine.
[756.30 → 757.04] You can just play it.
[757.04 → 757.46] Just play it.
[757.46 → 757.80] It's okay.
[758.06 → 759.02] The sound will carry.
[759.46 → 761.14] Trash, I've been practicing this one.
[761.22 → 762.52] Whoa, you do two in one hand?
[762.52 → 763.88] Yeah, of course.
[764.52 → 765.02] That's how it's ready.
[765.04 → 765.38] Of course.
[765.54 → 765.72] What?
[765.94 → 766.68] That's insane.
[767.02 → 767.86] I got to go back to...
[767.86 → 769.44] I'm practicing this one.
[769.44 → 769.92] Oh, sheet music.
[770.32 → 771.68] Oh, you can actually read music.
[771.82 → 772.66] You're a real musician.
[772.92 → 773.04] Okay.
[773.20 → 774.40] He's an actual real musician.
[774.60 → 774.70] Okay.
[774.86 → 775.24] All right.
[775.28 → 775.82] Ready, Trash?
[776.48 → 776.82] Yes.
[777.10 → 777.26] Jingle bells.
[777.26 → 778.38] You guys got to cut me some slack, too.
[778.48 → 779.00] Jingle bells.
[779.00 → 779.36] Let's go.
[779.86 → 780.06] Okay.
[783.58 → 785.14] I can't tell if he's playing that, for real.
[792.52 → 812.70] Oh, I forgot the next part, Trash.
[812.76 → 813.06] Sorry.
[813.52 → 813.98] It's okay.
[814.64 → 817.26] TJ, your just DMCA'd our stream with that banger.
[817.54 → 817.66] Okay.
[818.94 → 822.50] Trash, let me get the middle section, because I'm a little more ready for this.
[822.52 → 822.96] Okay.
[822.96 → 823.28] Okay.
[823.72 → 824.18] Here we go.
[824.24 → 824.38] Ready?
[824.62 → 825.16] I'm dancing.
[826.70 → 827.10] Oops.
[827.18 → 827.32] Sorry.
[827.40 → 828.22] Here we go.
[828.40 → 829.06] That's a banger.
[829.62 → 829.98] Ah!
[830.18 → 830.78] Ah, Trash!
[830.82 → 831.82] I'm getting nervous, okay?
[835.28 → 836.62] Oh, this is good.
[847.12 → 848.02] Casey starts singing.
[850.28 → 852.18] I am literally not a singer.
[852.18 → 853.98] I have never sung in anything in my life.
[853.98 → 854.16] I know.
[854.40 → 855.12] I've heard you say it.
[855.12 → 855.94] That's pretty much all the time.
[855.94 → 856.54] That was good.
[856.92 → 857.50] That was good.
[857.50 → 858.02] I'm not ready.
[858.06 → 859.02] I'm not ready to do.
[859.10 → 860.04] Nokia vibes.
[860.40 → 861.70] Oh, my God.
[861.70 → 862.18] Nokia.
[862.18 → 862.90] Oh, my God.
[862.90 → 863.94] It is Nokia vibes.
[863.98 → 864.76] Oh, my goodness.
[866.42 → 866.64] So.
[866.82 → 867.46] Oh, my God.
[867.46 → 868.06] That was good.
[868.32 → 868.52] Sorry.
[868.74 → 869.68] I was not ready.
[869.78 → 870.34] I was not ready.
[870.76 → 875.80] Dude, TJ, there's so many Dr. Dre songs you could have probably threw down on there.
[876.60 → 877.90] I thought you were going to hear some M&M.
[877.90 → 879.70] I want to hear some Chronic 2001.
[879.96 → 881.52] There's so many you could have probably thrown down on.
[882.42 → 883.18] Because I don't know any.
[883.36 → 884.12] I don't know any.
[884.12 → 886.06] I want to hear some Frank Zappa, dude.
[886.50 → 889.30] I don't know any non-classical like marimba solo.
[889.46 → 889.66] Sorry.
[890.06 → 892.42] I literally played concert percussion.
[892.76 → 892.78] So.
[893.32 → 893.70] Let's go.
[893.88 → 894.12] All right.
[894.24 → 894.64] All right.
[894.70 → 895.18] Let's go.
[895.62 → 895.94] All right.
[895.94 → 895.96] All right.
[896.02 → 896.46] Casey.
[897.16 → 897.46] Yeah.
[897.64 → 897.80] Yeah.
[897.80 → 899.92] I think you are next.
[900.72 → 907.40] So I am the weakest link in this chain by far because, like, I think I had a similar
[907.40 → 912.16] problem to Trash, which is that, like, if I look at the open source stuff that I personally
[912.16 → 914.58] use, there are very few things.
[914.58 → 920.10] And they are, like, kind of the obvious, like, very popular things that probably don't
[920.10 → 923.96] need $5,000, like Linux in general, right?
[923.96 → 924.56] Or something.
[925.64 → 930.44] Whereas I don't actually have any open source stuff that I use myself that's like, oh, here's
[930.44 → 935.34] this, you know, this smaller project that's not obvious that I can say, like, I really
[935.34 → 937.44] love this project, or I use it all the time or something like that.
[937.52 → 945.48] So what I did to make up for my own shortcomings is I asked around some people who I know who
[945.48 → 948.16] I feel like are more knowledgeable about this sort of thing.
[949.04 → 952.24] And I basically came up with two things.
[952.24 → 958.32] One is I came up with a list that I was hoping we could throw to chat as part of.
[958.52 → 963.02] I kind of anticipated the fact that chat might be involved in voting later.
[963.52 → 970.62] So I came up with a list from people's recommendations of, like, smaller, less well-known open source
[970.62 → 972.40] projects that they think are really cool.
[972.62 → 979.88] And I posted that in the studio chat as a gist that you can grab if you want to and sort of
[979.88 → 981.92] put it up on the screen or post it in the chat.
[982.24 → 983.74] So that was one thing I did.
[983.92 → 988.08] And those are all projects that I'm, like, not really familiar with and couldn't really
[988.08 → 989.70] say very much about because I don't use them.
[990.44 → 993.84] But they are all from people who I trust to not give stupid recommendations.
[994.16 → 998.52] I also like that a bunch of people were, like, FFMPEG, which I included on that list because
[998.52 → 1003.02] I thought it was hilarious since they recently were in a spat with Theo over a donation.
[1003.02 → 1009.12] And so I was like, OK, well, if people are recommending it, maybe you can reverse.
[1009.28 → 1013.94] Maybe you can donate to them on the condition that they keep their social media team.
[1014.30 → 1017.46] And you can have, like, competing donations to see who could.
[1017.54 → 1022.56] You could, like, drive up FFMPEG donations by people competing over whether the X account
[1022.56 → 1024.10] remains as it is or different.
[1024.10 → 1027.92] But I did want to pick an open source project.
[1028.56 → 1034.00] And I figured I could let you guys decide whether you want my gift to go to this or just to go
[1034.00 → 1035.28] into the larger pool.
[1035.36 → 1037.74] Because, like I said, I'm the wrong one to pick this sort of stuff.
[1037.80 → 1038.96] So I'm just doing my best here.
[1039.66 → 1042.88] There is one project recently that I thought was extremely cool.
[1042.88 → 1046.42] And it is by a guy named Jimmy Before.
[1047.32 → 1053.70] And he, so for those of you who don't know, there's this very large kind of sprawling open
[1053.70 → 1055.56] source project called Abuzz.
[1055.84 → 1057.26] Has anyone heard of this?
[1057.40 → 1058.50] Anyone know what this is?
[1058.94 → 1059.56] I've heard of Abuzz.
[1059.56 → 1060.22] Something for fonts?
[1060.80 → 1061.06] Yeah.
[1061.16 → 1066.54] So Abuzz is basically what everyone uses, like everyone, whether you know it or not,
[1066.56 → 1067.62] it's under the hood somewhere.
[1067.62 → 1073.92] It's what everyone uses for dealing with, like, the sort of text shaping problem in
[1073.92 → 1074.46] Unicode.
[1074.64 → 1079.12] So Unicode is kind of a mess as a standard in and of itself.
[1079.44 → 1085.50] And it has all of these esoteric requirements, just like crazy amounts of, like, special requirements
[1085.50 → 1089.98] of, like, okay, if you're doing this particular language, you need to look at these code points.
[1089.98 → 1094.90] And if they occur in this order and the font says that it handles that thing, then you have
[1094.90 → 1096.82] to output that in this specific way.
[1096.82 → 1098.94] But if it doesn't, then you have to output it in this other specific way.
[1099.16 → 1101.16] It's all this ridiculous logic.
[1101.94 → 1103.34] It's kind of like...
[1103.34 → 1104.44] Isn't there something with families, right?
[1104.48 → 1106.92] Where it's like it has every possible mutation with families.
[1107.02 → 1112.08] You can be like one dad, two moms, four kids, three dogs, and you can, like, specify to some
[1112.08 → 1114.82] crazy combination to come down to a singular...
[1115.66 → 1119.68] I mean, my expectation is that's probably not even the craziest thing.
[1120.02 → 1123.76] Like, when you start getting into, like, all, you know, other languages, like, that have
[1123.76 → 1126.24] very complex glyph rules, right?
[1126.46 → 1126.80] Mm-hmm.
[1127.92 → 1130.60] So, basically, this is a really nasty problem.
[1130.88 → 1132.18] And it's very...
[1132.18 → 1135.96] It's underspecified, too, because you go to, like, the Unicode specs, and sometimes they
[1135.96 → 1139.10] might not be quite complete, or they might have some kind of errors in them, or they
[1139.10 → 1139.68] might have...
[1139.68 → 1144.02] The actual thing that people now expect has, like, drifted away from what the specification
[1144.02 → 1145.48] is, or all these other sorts of things.
[1145.54 → 1148.16] So, it's a huge problem.
[1148.16 → 1150.66] And basically, what everyone does is they just use Abuzz.
[1150.96 → 1152.72] They just use Abuzz because they're like, forget it.
[1152.80 → 1155.52] Like, there's no way that we're going to sit down and write this thing.
[1155.90 → 1158.86] And that's kind of annoying because Abuzz is this big, sprawling library.
[1159.10 → 1163.32] And especially if you're a developer who's, like, very conscientious about trying to, like,
[1163.54 → 1167.24] make sure that you manage memory in a specific way, or that you have, like, some very hard
[1167.24 → 1170.78] constraints on how much time things take, or all these other sorts of things, or you
[1170.78 → 1173.64] just don't want your product to have 8,000 files in it, right?
[1174.80 → 1177.34] Using Abuzz is kind of a little gross.
[1177.34 → 1181.14] It's the same as, you know, you're kind of forcing this big thing onto your project.
[1181.94 → 1183.66] And if you're someone like Chrome, who cares?
[1183.72 → 1186.24] Because you already take seven years to compile, and you're already, right?
[1186.32 → 1187.66] You know, it's like, it doesn't...
[1187.66 → 1192.52] At some projects, it doesn't matter because you're just, you know, you're already crossed
[1192.52 → 1193.64] that bridge, and so who cares?
[1194.10 → 1196.22] But for other projects, it's like, oh, God, great.
[1196.28 → 1199.44] I want to do, like, reasonable Unicode support in this project.
[1199.82 → 1201.80] I don't want to do this, but you have to, right?
[1201.82 → 1204.50] And so you take this gigantic hit of importing Abuzz.
[1204.50 → 1211.10] Well, for reasons I don't know, I probably should have asked him, because I actually
[1211.10 → 1211.64] know this guy.
[1211.82 → 1214.20] I probably should have asked him at some point, and I just never have.
[1215.12 → 1218.24] Jimmy Leftover, at some point, just decided, he's like, you know what?
[1218.26 → 1219.24] I'm going to solve this problem.
[1220.08 → 1221.60] And he sat down...
[1221.60 → 1222.68] Can we pause for one second?
[1223.00 → 1223.30] Yes.
[1224.64 → 1226.44] I didn't even know this was a thing.
[1227.14 → 1229.18] Twitch just gifted 100 subs.
[1230.04 → 1231.26] Mr. Twitch himself.
[1231.26 → 1233.72] Mr. Twitch, this is not planned.
[1233.84 → 1236.56] I didn't go to my partner manager and try to come up with some sort of concoctions.
[1236.76 → 1239.14] This was purely all-natural grass-fed gifting.
[1239.32 → 1241.60] So Twitch just gave 100 subs to this channel.
[1242.56 → 1243.06] Thank you, Trolls.
[1243.10 → 1244.78] Which is 100 subs to Neovim.
[1245.00 → 1246.28] Thank you, Twitch.
[1246.52 → 1248.12] That was to open source today.
[1248.22 → 1249.06] So, hey, thank you.
[1249.64 → 1251.86] DJ Dan Clancy, thank you for the gifted subs.
[1251.94 → 1252.54] Appreciate that.
[1252.54 → 1257.04] Basically, what we've learned is whoever's manning that Twitch channel, whoever's manning
[1257.04 → 1260.62] the Twitch gift sub thing is a Vim user.
[1260.84 → 1261.78] That's what we just found out.
[1263.06 → 1264.36] Vim user confirmed.
[1264.98 → 1268.34] They heard that beginning, and they're like, oh boy, we're going to sub to this channel.
[1269.76 → 1270.08] Exactly.
[1270.76 → 1271.68] Thanks, Jeff Bezos.
[1272.40 → 1272.94] That was cool.
[1273.00 → 1275.64] I've never seen Twitch interact like that before.
[1275.84 → 1276.68] I've never seen Twitch do that.
[1276.76 → 1279.80] They've had ones where it's like, they had one with a, I forget what it was.
[1279.80 → 1283.08] It was some company that partnered with them, so if you gifted five subs, they'd give you
[1283.08 → 1286.14] some, it was Valorant or something, they'd give a couple extra, and that was by Twitch.
[1286.74 → 1289.42] But this one was actually just Twitch all natural, not partnered with anybody.
[1289.62 → 1290.04] All natural.
[1290.96 → 1291.28] Unusual.
[1291.42 → 1292.00] Never seen that before.
[1292.06 → 1292.38] Thank you.
[1292.58 → 1294.50] So anyway, it was actually a good stopping point, right?
[1294.56 → 1295.28] That's Abuzz.
[1296.04 → 1302.74] So anyway, Jimmy Leftover actually sat down and, for whatever reason, took it upon himself
[1302.74 → 1304.34] to just be like, you know what?
[1304.62 → 1307.10] I'm going to do an entire replacement for that.
[1307.10 → 1309.98] But I'm going to do it in one file.
[1310.36 → 1311.40] Just a.h file.
[1311.54 → 1317.92] You can pound include, and it's just going to be this one 11,000 line.h file that just,
[1318.08 → 1320.60] I've packed everything into tables.
[1320.80 → 1323.86] Like I wrote, you wrote a bunch of stuff that generates all this stuff and packs it into
[1323.86 → 1324.58] little tables.
[1324.90 → 1328.98] You just pound include in your thing, and you basically get the entire equivalent of Abuzz
[1328.98 → 1332.54] in one pound include, one file.
[1332.66 → 1334.36] That's all you need to bring it to your project.
[1334.36 → 1339.72] And that is so, like, it's such a monumental amount of work to do this.
[1340.28 → 1345.08] I posted a link in the studio chat if you want to paste that into real chat or anything
[1345.08 → 1345.62] like that.
[1346.16 → 1346.58] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1346.58 → 1347.18] I'll do that right now.
[1347.32 → 1348.04] You can see it.
[1348.10 → 1352.08] It's literally like there's just kbtextshape.h.
[1352.12 → 1355.48] You click on it, and it's this just one file.
[1355.48 → 1356.20] Oh, sorry.
[1356.20 → 1361.80] And not only is it one file, so it's super easy to use, but it's also, like, designed
[1361.80 → 1363.78] with good programmer human factors.
[1363.98 → 1369.00] Like, it's designed so you can pass memory allocations into it so it doesn't have to,
[1369.08 → 1373.00] like, it doesn't go do kind of ridiculous allocations behind your back and all this sort
[1373.00 → 1373.26] of stuff.
[1373.48 → 1378.72] It's, like, designed so that you can use it in projects that are very specific and very,
[1378.72 → 1381.02] like, technically, like, targeted.
[1381.02 → 1385.68] You don't have to be a big sprawling project with Ba lox and Freeze everywhere or whoever,
[1385.96 → 1386.78] you know, whatever else.
[1386.90 → 1389.82] So it's, like, a perfect human factors library as well.
[1390.24 → 1392.54] And so that's my pick.
[1393.18 → 1394.92] That's what I would pick for the donation.
[1395.08 → 1403.54] The only reason that I am saying, like, I don't know is because I already kind of did
[1403.54 → 1410.22] my own pseudo donation to this project, which was I basically, like, I won't go into details,
[1410.22 → 1414.82] but I basically said, like, hey, do you want to go work at any companies around here?
[1414.82 → 1415.66] And the guy was, like, yes.
[1415.66 → 1417.08] And I was, like, all right, I'm going to hook you up.
[1417.24 → 1422.90] And he's now going to work somewhere cool, I'll simply say, as a result of this project.
[1423.14 → 1423.50] Awesome.
[1423.76 → 1430.34] And so he might not need the donation as much as some other project somewhere, so I didn't
[1430.34 → 1431.46] want to, like, say for sure.
[1431.56 → 1435.00] But if it's just purely my pick, this is the project for me.
[1435.00 → 1435.90] I say go.
[1436.16 → 1437.10] We got to go for it.
[1437.14 → 1437.70] This is awesome.
[1438.02 → 1438.34] Yeah, for sure.
[1438.34 → 1439.06] Yes.
[1439.72 → 1440.78] Great pick, Casey.
[1441.26 → 1443.86] I love also that you said pound include instead of import.
[1444.06 → 1447.70] Like, keeping it correct in that world, I really, you know, I see that.
[1447.78 → 1449.54] I recognize your effort there, even in language.
[1450.10 → 1450.38] Oh, dude.
[1450.74 → 1452.98] In C, we never got no import.
[1453.34 → 1455.24] We didn't get, nobody ever figured out modules.
[1455.46 → 1456.12] Are you kidding me?
[1456.48 → 1461.50] C++ committee is still chasing their tail trying to figure out how to do modules, right?
[1461.50 → 1463.78] They think they did, but they didn't.
[1464.20 → 1465.50] So, yeah, pound include.
[1465.50 → 1468.24] And by the way, we say hashtag now, so its hashtag include.
[1468.32 → 1469.02] Hashtag include.
[1469.32 → 1469.48] Yeah.
[1469.78 → 1470.46] Hashtag include.
[1470.82 → 1471.58] Hashtag include.
[1472.16 → 1473.04] I love it.
[1473.36 → 1473.52] Yeah.
[1474.42 → 1478.76] And then, like I said, I also have that list there that I just wanted to throw out to chat
[1478.76 → 1482.96] that you can look at some point if we want to do community picks.
[1482.96 → 1488.62] And that was just a list that I got from other people who use a lot of open source stuff and
[1488.62 → 1490.86] also contribute to open source a lot.
[1491.00 → 1494.78] And this is their list of things that they thought were cool and maybe less contributed
[1494.78 → 1495.66] to than others.
[1496.18 → 1498.24] The Lua JIT on there, that was pretty legit.
[1498.50 → 1501.68] I didn't really mean to do it that way, but that was pretty awesome.
[1501.94 → 1502.50] I like that a lot.
[1502.72 → 1502.96] Oh, my goodness.
[1504.06 → 1504.28] Okay.
[1504.36 → 1505.76] Don't goodness me, TJ.
[1506.58 → 1508.26] That's a joke that I would say.
[1508.32 → 1509.04] All right, Santa?
[1509.32 → 1509.76] Come on.
[1509.86 → 1510.54] Leave it to the L.
[1510.54 → 1510.86] Okay.
[1510.94 → 1511.18] Sorry.
[1511.30 → 1511.58] I did.
[1511.68 → 1512.02] You know what?
[1512.30 → 1513.42] Classic micromanaging.
[1513.56 → 1514.24] Just doing it.
[1514.30 → 1515.40] Just doing the L's job.
[1515.62 → 1517.04] That's my job, bro.
[1517.24 → 1517.96] That's my job.
[1518.14 → 1519.68] You're taking my job.
[1520.88 → 1521.70] I have a question.
[1522.30 → 1522.52] Yes.
[1522.52 → 1524.62] Did you ever say C pound instead of C sharp?
[1526.22 → 1526.54] Ooh.
[1527.16 → 1528.86] I like that a lot.
[1528.94 → 1529.62] Or C hashtag.
[1529.80 → 1531.18] We're going to start doing that.
[1531.30 → 1533.16] I 100% used to say C pound because I didn't know.
[1533.58 → 1535.62] C hashtag sounds good.
[1535.76 → 1536.22] C hashtag.
[1536.38 → 1537.38] Do you guys recommend C hashtag?
[1538.28 → 1538.50] Yeah.
[1538.60 → 1538.96] C hashtag.
[1538.96 → 1539.32] I like that.
[1539.32 → 1539.78] I like that.
[1539.84 → 1543.42] You know, we're getting dangerously close to making some jokes about the pound sign that
[1543.42 → 1545.32] we're going to get into inappropriate territory.
[1545.70 → 1545.98] Okay.
[1546.24 → 1548.70] Trash already crossed the line too many times for a charity stream.
[1548.80 → 1549.82] We'll save that for next week.
[1549.96 → 1551.10] New year, new pod.
[1551.40 → 1551.66] Yeah.
[1551.74 → 1552.62] New year, new pod.
[1553.10 → 1554.46] This stood up.
[1555.12 → 1555.30] Nope.
[1556.90 → 1557.92] I'm not going to say it.
[1558.02 → 1558.70] Not going to say it.
[1558.76 → 1559.00] All right.
[1560.08 → 1561.50] Casey, I love that pick, though.
[1561.66 → 1562.48] That's such a good pick.
[1562.50 → 1562.94] Okay, cool.
[1563.06 → 1563.26] Great.
[1563.34 → 1563.70] I'm glad.
[1563.70 → 1568.46] Because this was a tough, this was the hardest episode for me to prepare so far that we've
[1568.46 → 1568.76] done.
[1569.08 → 1570.94] Because I'm like, I don't know.
[1571.12 → 1575.14] But this is like a classic one where, you know, the world's infrastructure meme.
[1575.26 → 1577.82] And then there's like that one little twig that's holding it all up.
[1577.98 → 1582.18] This is like classically one of those projects where it's just like, this is actually holding
[1582.18 → 1586.00] up a significant portion of probably people's experience in life.
[1586.64 → 1586.94] Yeah.
[1586.94 → 1593.28] And I feel like adding Unicode support is kind of necessary if you want to be a global project.
[1593.28 → 1598.08] And it's been traditionally a huge pain in the butt for people who are trying to make like
[1598.08 → 1600.38] small, focused, fast compiling projects.
[1600.70 → 1604.16] Because like you now have to like import Abuzz and import all this stuff.
[1604.24 → 1607.08] And like this is a perfect step towards making that easier.
[1607.28 → 1608.64] So this was a great project.
[1608.90 → 1612.16] And I think he really did the world of service with this one.
[1613.60 → 1615.02] I think it's cool you got him a job.
[1615.56 → 1615.96] Nice.
[1616.34 → 1617.08] He deserved it.
[1617.12 → 1618.00] He got himself the job.
[1618.22 → 1618.40] Yeah.
[1618.40 → 1618.84] Yeah.
[1619.78 → 1623.20] You know, this is so this is I'm going to do a little small rant because,
[1623.30 → 1627.22] you know, we're also just getting, you know, some sweet times in between each one
[1627.22 → 1627.44] of these.
[1627.54 → 1631.78] But oh, yeah, I will say this is that whole problem because, you know, there's been many
[1631.78 → 1635.22] videos not to call out Theo multiple times now on this one.
[1636.34 → 1638.62] Don't do open source to get a job.
[1638.62 → 1641.20] But also people who do good open source get a job.
[1641.26 → 1646.40] There is definitely some weird world that exists where when you do open source, if you do a
[1646.40 → 1650.72] good job, there is seemingly more opportunity sometimes for people who do it.
[1650.78 → 1653.28] And it's a more complex and nuanced thing.
[1653.50 → 1654.90] Just don't do it for the soul's sake.
[1655.00 → 1656.56] You have to have something you actually want to solve.
[1657.14 → 1659.08] Well, I think you could do it to get a job.
[1659.28 → 1666.50] But the problem is like I just say I like Theo's take on this, but it's like I
[1666.50 → 1670.94] think it's mostly like perfect open source developers can get jobs.
[1671.16 → 1676.36] The problem is a bunch of people think that it's just open source developers get jobs.
[1676.40 → 1680.06] So it's like if you're not developing skills, if you're not improving things, if you're
[1680.06 → 1685.16] not actually like shipping stuff and doing good work, it's not going to it's not going
[1685.16 → 1685.78] to do anything.
[1686.24 → 1690.78] So it's like that's that's like honestly the people are putting the cart before the horse
[1690.78 → 1691.26] on it, right?
[1691.28 → 1697.14] Where it's like, oh, if I just do open source, that magically makes me good and magically
[1697.14 → 1698.00] gets me hired.
[1698.00 → 1700.22] But that's not that's not what it is.
[1700.22 → 1701.14] That's not what happens.
[1701.34 → 1702.80] Which I agreed with that side of the take.
[1702.80 → 1707.04] But I don't like the phrase don't do open source for jobs, which is like I know plenty
[1707.04 → 1710.30] of people that did that to get a job because they are already excellent developers and they
[1710.30 → 1711.96] wanted a way to show themselves off.
[1712.28 → 1714.18] So it's an it's a confusing world.
[1716.14 → 1716.78] All right.
[1718.04 → 1719.16] I can go.
[1719.50 → 1719.98] Want me to go?
[1720.36 → 1720.52] Yeah.
[1720.60 → 1721.04] OK, here.
[1721.46 → 1722.26] We'll see how that.
[1722.34 → 1726.02] Sorry, I may have to just turn off my, you know, my green screen.
[1726.74 → 1728.38] All elf costumes are green, dude.
[1728.40 → 1729.14] What is going on?
[1729.14 → 1734.98] My preference, though, I would just like to say my preference, if is it's possible,
[1735.52 → 1741.22] would be for this to be accompanied by at least some marimba.
[1742.06 → 1745.20] OK, I can play a song that I can actually play the whole thing through.
[1745.28 → 1746.84] I don't know why I picked the song I've been practicing.
[1747.00 → 1748.86] That's like that's stupid moves, you know?
[1748.92 → 1749.14] Yeah.
[1749.18 → 1753.92] Like, so I would like I would like some marimba to be involved at some point at your discretion,
[1754.08 → 1754.38] certainly.
[1754.72 → 1757.36] OK, you should play it while you're picking, while you're announcing your pick.
[1757.36 → 1760.32] It's kind of hard to be facing away from a presentation.
[1760.58 → 1763.60] Look, he has 20 slides, 20 slides, 20.
[1764.78 → 1765.30] No, no.
[1765.32 → 1768.98] But that's because like each bullet point that comes out is a slide.
[1769.04 → 1769.80] It's just a mark.
[1769.88 → 1771.08] This is inside of Neo of him.
[1771.18 → 1773.32] That's like two hundred fifty dollars a slide.
[1774.32 → 1775.38] Great point.
[1775.50 → 1778.54] I do you guys think I could work for a consulting firm?
[1779.68 → 1780.16] Yeah.
[1782.48 → 1783.70] McKenzie, here we come.
[1784.34 → 1785.52] McKenzie, here we go.
[1785.52 → 1788.10] I mean, like the elf costume, a little helper.
[1788.98 → 1791.08] Magic, you know, makes money disappear.
[1791.22 → 1792.04] I think I could do it.
[1792.74 → 1794.88] OK, so.
[1795.58 → 1796.28] All right.
[1796.36 → 1796.78] Well, here you go.
[1796.82 → 1799.54] It's just a quick slide because first off, I know Casey doesn't know this.
[1799.58 → 1803.18] So I want to give him a little bit of introduction to this thing because I want to.
[1803.34 → 1804.96] I think it's kind of its kind of cool.
[1805.44 → 1807.16] Also, I think I'll just really quickly.
[1807.46 → 1808.06] Can I do this?
[1808.06 → 1810.24] By the way, TJ, you can call yourself the agile elf.
[1811.36 → 1813.08] Oh, I know.
[1813.52 → 1814.36] It's so good.
[1814.46 → 1815.00] There we go here.
[1815.32 → 1818.04] Make myself a lot smaller just so I don't overlap anything here.
[1818.26 → 1819.18] And I'm an elf.
[1819.28 → 1820.64] So that makes sense, too.
[1822.00 → 1822.56] All right.
[1822.64 → 1825.06] So it's just logic.
[1825.26 → 1825.36] OK.
[1826.68 → 1827.20] All right.
[1827.60 → 1830.40] So this is probably not a surprise.
[1830.48 → 1832.44] Anyone who's been following around with me lately.
[1832.44 → 1836.50] I've been writing a lot and checking out a lot of stuff with effect TS.
[1836.64 → 1842.98] Just a little overview of what is effect TS and just some of the things I like about it since we've been doing that.
[1843.26 → 1844.52] So what is it?
[1844.78 → 1850.12] It's a way to write TypeScript where instead of hating your experience, you can like it.
[1850.16 → 1850.90] At least for me.
[1850.98 → 1853.60] That's been that's been my experience so far.
[1854.16 → 1855.32] So what does it do?
[1855.32 → 1858.38] It is pretty much like you make an effect.
[1859.00 → 1859.74] So effects.
[1859.88 → 1860.58] Casey, you'll like this.
[1860.78 → 1862.50] They're lazy computational units.
[1862.86 → 1863.10] I don't know.
[1863.12 → 1864.20] It doesn't really matter that much.
[1864.70 → 1866.60] The main idea, though, for this.
[1866.88 → 1867.20] OK.
[1867.68 → 1868.36] You can't do that.
[1868.36 → 1869.66] I knew he wasn't going to like that part.
[1869.66 → 1875.14] I know I shouldn't have put JavaScript right here because that's going to that's going to end our conversation.
[1875.62 → 1889.34] But the idea here is that instead of throwing errors for everything, instead of like just letting people act like JavaScript, the one that was designed in 10 days, and we're going to build the whole rest of the web on it.
[1889.34 → 1897.66] What if we like tried and thought a little bit more about it and tried to make the experience like a little safer, a little bit like more leaning into the type system, trying to help it out?
[1897.66 → 1899.16] That's the very, very short pitch.
[1899.20 → 1899.90] OK, the very short pitch.
[1899.94 → 1900.98] I have a few other examples.
[1901.20 → 1903.60] OK, so I don't like exceptions in TypeScript.
[1903.78 → 1906.70] People just like throw errors all the time and then it crashes.
[1906.74 → 1908.30] And then you're like, why is this not working?
[1908.30 → 1910.56] And you look in the console, and it's just like red lines.
[1910.56 → 1913.20] And you're like, how is this how is this experience?
[1913.20 → 1919.10] How is every major website throwing red lines in the console on the Internet in 2025?
[1919.50 → 1919.64] Right.
[1920.10 → 1922.72] I like instead errors as values.
[1922.72 → 1923.22] Right.
[1923.68 → 1927.62] And I actually like if I'm going to care about a service, you know, like we care about.
[1927.66 → 1930.18] What errors we can get back, not just throw new error.
[1930.38 → 1931.36] OK, right.
[1931.62 → 1933.40] So what does that mean?
[1933.98 → 1936.74] An effect basically has three parts.
[1936.84 → 1937.66] OK, three parts.
[1937.90 → 1940.04] There's a success and an error.
[1940.04 → 1942.76] So Casey, this is like a result in a lot of languages.
[1942.76 → 1945.38] If you're familiar with, you know, some classic monads.
[1945.54 → 1945.70] Right.
[1946.14 → 1954.48] The extra thing that we'll get to at the end is this little bonus, bonus piece of info that gets tagged into an effect, which is the requirements.
[1954.48 → 1959.12] So what this computational unit, what this effect depends on.
[1959.36 → 1959.76] Right.
[1959.76 → 1963.66] So that could be like a database could be like it has to connect to the network.
[1963.94 → 1967.00] It could be that I have a service that manages users.
[1967.26 → 1971.02] Whatever it is, we're going to be able to say what things this depends on.
[1971.62 → 1972.86] OK, everyone following so far?
[1972.92 → 1973.32] Is this OK?
[1975.12 → 1975.94] I mean.
[1977.48 → 1977.88] Continue.
[1978.52 → 1979.22] OK, all right.
[1979.24 → 1979.62] That's fine.
[1980.82 → 1981.88] This is too big here.
[1982.24 → 1982.92] OK, so here you go.
[1982.98 → 1984.62] So here's an example.
[1985.04 → 1985.36] All right.
[1985.62 → 1988.20] We make just excuse.
[1988.32 → 1990.92] It's a little verbose because it has to fit inside of TypeScript.
[1991.08 → 1994.74] OK, so there's a little bit of a little bit of extra things going on there.
[1994.74 → 2000.12] The main thing I wanted to show here is that we write that it can fail here.
[2000.18 → 2001.30] So we don't throw anything.
[2001.44 → 2002.32] We return it.
[2002.76 → 2002.90] Right.
[2003.12 → 2004.20] And so what is this?
[2004.52 → 2005.40] What does this do?
[2005.48 → 2007.44] An HTTP error is just an error that we make.
[2007.82 → 2015.30] OK, when we look at what this program's type is, because it's like a's basically like a lazy function.
[2015.30 → 2016.48] So we get this function.
[2016.54 → 2017.18] It says an effect.
[2017.24 → 2020.84] If we recall from before, we said there's success, error and requirements.
[2020.84 → 2021.14] Right.
[2021.48 → 2022.70] So it returns a string.
[2023.02 → 2024.48] Normally, that's the easy one.
[2024.90 → 2028.02] The errors that it can have are the HTTP error here.
[2028.24 → 2028.60] Right.
[2028.86 → 2033.52] And then and then it has requirements, which should say actually random here.
[2033.58 → 2034.94] But I didn't write that down for some.
[2035.04 → 2035.46] Oh, no, no.
[2035.46 → 2035.68] Sorry.
[2035.80 → 2036.30] That's right here.
[2036.40 → 2039.78] Yes, it's just this is just a function that returns a random number between zero and one.
[2039.84 → 2043.90] OK, so it says we succeed with a string, and we fail with an HTTP error.
[2044.12 → 2045.62] This is so nice.
[2045.82 → 2052.84] If you're used to just like, I don't know, when I've written TypeScript at companies, and you're like interacting with other people's code,
[2052.84 → 2055.40] you can never tell what's going to fail.
[2056.34 → 2057.04] It's not possible.
[2057.14 → 2057.66] No trash.
[2057.74 → 2059.06] Maybe you can back me up on this.
[2059.06 → 2059.76] I agree.
[2060.10 → 2060.20] That's true.
[2060.84 → 2068.98] TypeScript has rejected the at throws symbol as part of their as part of their documentation so that you could actually say all the functions that throw.
[2068.98 → 2073.24] So people could better prepare for if something throws and wraps it correctly, because a lot of people don't know, say, JSON.
[2073.50 → 2078.60] Every single rookie programmer out there takes down their server because they do a JSON dot parse.
[2078.68 → 2080.16] And it turns out invalid JSON.
[2080.30 → 2081.14] Boom, your server goes down.
[2082.10 → 2084.64] So JSON dot parse can throw an exception.
[2085.02 → 2085.16] Right.
[2085.28 → 2087.70] Very passionate about the fact that they don't denote this.
[2087.76 → 2088.70] It pisses me off.
[2088.76 → 2089.40] But anyway, keep going.
[2089.50 → 2093.26] So effect says, OK, TypeScript's not going to fix that problem.
[2093.34 → 2095.80] Generally, we can write programs in a way that it's going to.
[2095.88 → 2096.90] We're going to return errors.
[2096.90 → 2098.70] So it's failures or successes.
[2099.42 → 2100.80] So that I like this.
[2100.88 → 2101.86] Now I can go to a piece of code.
[2101.94 → 2105.66] I can see how it can fail and what and what it does when it doesn't fail.
[2105.76 → 2106.20] That's good.
[2106.30 → 2107.90] All complicated code can fail.
[2109.02 → 2110.32] Actually, simple code can fail, too.
[2110.58 → 2111.34] So that's number one.
[2111.54 → 2112.88] What else do I like about it?
[2113.04 → 2115.38] It's got cool pattern matching stuff.
[2115.84 → 2120.52] So the nice thing for it is you can build up different data types.
[2120.76 → 2124.08] And like this is an example of something I'm actually using this code.
[2124.50 → 2126.60] Sorry, it's squished a little bit here.
[2126.60 → 2132.92] But the main idea is even though you can't actually do pattern matching because TypeScript still doesn't want to add that for some reason, it's going to be stuck in.
[2133.20 → 2134.22] It's kind of like C++.
[2134.56 → 2139.74] Casey, you know how they like to propose a feature you're looking forward to and then like it sits there forever.
[2140.26 → 2140.86] I don't know.
[2140.92 → 2141.54] Trash agreed.
[2141.76 → 2143.92] Is that not is that not how you feel with?
[2144.00 → 2147.20] Yeah, I mean, everything goes into TC39, and it just dies in TC39.
[2147.62 → 2148.16] So right.
[2148.36 → 2149.44] So everyone's excited.
[2149.56 → 2150.34] They're like, cool.
[2150.40 → 2151.58] We're going to have this feature.
[2151.58 → 2153.66] And then it never happens.
[2153.66 → 2158.98] So the thing that I like about this is like this is another thing.
[2159.04 → 2164.44] Effect kind of wraps up all of these ideas into one standard library where everything like plays nicely together.
[2164.68 → 2169.24] So the cool thing for this is this status is a field on my content page.
[2169.24 → 2181.22] The thing to note is it's like there are certain values it can be if I had typed like publish here instead of published, it would have an error because it actually is doing like really complicated type checks to make sure that that works.
[2181.56 → 2186.94] So that's great because I want to be able to know safely that these things are all matching up with each other.
[2186.94 → 2191.50] There's also like more kinds of pattern matching, like I said, that it has.
[2191.58 → 2194.40] I'm not going to go too deep into this for those of you who are interested.
[2194.70 → 2195.64] I really like this.
[2195.74 → 2196.64] This makes me happy.
[2196.76 → 2206.66] I miss like writing OCaml and some other languages that can let me know that I'm actually handing all the case handling all the case instead of like if else if else if else is whoops.
[2207.20 → 2208.28] That's I don't want that.
[2208.40 → 2209.86] If I didn't include a question.
[2210.08 → 2211.56] Is that an is that a TypeScript error?
[2211.82 → 2211.94] Right.
[2211.96 → 2213.48] Is that a compile time TypeScript error?
[2214.86 → 2215.22] What?
[2215.22 → 2217.14] In if else if else if else if else if else is.
[2217.14 → 2219.50] Or is that a runtime like hey, you didn't handle all the cases?
[2220.48 → 2222.80] In effect or in regular TypeScript?
[2222.82 → 2223.68] Yeah, in effect with the match.
[2223.92 → 2226.46] In effect, if I didn't have this, it would be a TypeScript error.
[2226.94 → 2227.32] Oh, nice.
[2227.32 → 2228.64] Okay, so you get some compile time stuff.
[2228.72 → 2229.92] Oh, that is very nice.
[2230.56 → 2238.66] Yeah, so this like property here, this is a union effectively of these different types with tags, right?
[2238.66 → 2244.22] So it says if I didn't include number here, it would say, yo, dog, you're not handling number correctly, right?
[2244.22 → 2246.68] Which is what I want to have happened.
[2246.78 → 2248.96] If I change this notion property thing.
[2249.14 → 2252.26] This is real code that I've been writing like this past week and a half.
[2252.34 → 2257.60] So that's why I picked this because we're writing some cool like automation stuff for Prime's YouTube.
[2257.60 → 2260.16] So I like this.
[2260.16 → 2262.88] It helps me make sure that I'm handling the cases.
[2263.10 → 2267.08] I miss exhaustive pattern matching from like different functional languages I've enjoyed.
[2267.68 → 2270.88] But yeah, so that part I really like.
[2270.96 → 2271.56] I think it's cool too.
[2272.46 → 2274.86] Schema by itself is a really cool thing.
[2275.00 → 2277.28] I'm not going to go into crazy detail on this either.
[2277.36 → 2279.48] I'm just pasting some code snippets from what I have.
[2279.48 → 2286.02] This is a generated schema that I did where I asked Notion, hey, Notion, what does our table look like?
[2286.90 → 2292.12] So it returns like what fields and columns we have in this like Notion database table that we're using.
[2292.24 → 2293.86] And I generated a schema.
[2293.86 → 2297.92] And the cool thing for this really short is it just says like here's the literal.
[2298.08 → 2300.30] So it says it could be upcoming, short, live, or video.
[2301.26 → 2303.92] You can actually like use this inside of here.
[2304.06 → 2307.06] And then when I decode this, this is the thing Prime's going to like.
[2307.30 → 2310.18] Instead of just calling JSON.parse and then saying as any.
[2311.32 → 2312.70] As any as.
[2313.28 → 2315.10] Parse doesn't as any on top of it.
[2315.20 → 2315.44] Yeah, yeah.
[2315.44 → 2327.00] Instead of doing that, this will check and make sure that each of the values that I'm putting into this basically like class or struct actually matches all the constraints that I said.
[2327.12 → 2330.98] And will like to give me back an effect failure if it doesn't do that.
[2331.10 → 2334.10] So I'm forced to handle the case where it doesn't parse correctly.
[2334.34 → 2335.52] You're like, wow, crazy.
[2335.64 → 2337.56] You're like, yes, for some reason, no, it does this.
[2337.92 → 2341.80] When you say parse correctly, do you mean like if it doesn't match the shape of the object?
[2342.56 → 2342.74] Yes.
[2342.74 → 2344.74] So like first off, it's like a replacement.
[2344.74 → 2345.96] It's like a replacement for God.
[2346.04 → 2347.44] It's a runtime validation of types.
[2347.84 → 2347.96] Yep.
[2348.14 → 2349.18] Yes, it will do that too.
[2349.18 → 2349.30] Very cool.
[2349.30 → 2349.52] Yes.
[2350.14 → 2351.02] Quick question to you.
[2351.44 → 2352.36] Yes, go ahead, Trash.
[2352.46 → 2352.84] Of course.
[2353.24 → 2354.60] So a lot of stuff you're writing with Effect.
[2354.68 → 2359.12] Effect basically has some like core lib that like exports a bunch of these little utils for you.
[2359.20 → 2363.76] Like I can't just use a random library and have it work type magically.
[2363.86 → 2366.84] Because obviously it needs all this like magical type of time scenes.
[2368.54 → 2369.30] Well, it depends.
[2369.30 → 2371.10] So like I'll give an example, actually.
[2371.44 → 2372.24] Trash, great question.
[2372.68 → 2373.04] Services.
[2373.04 → 2373.24] Services.
[2374.14 → 2374.68] There you go.
[2374.68 → 2374.86] I'll go down.
[2375.40 → 2376.30] Let me give you.
[2376.56 → 2378.10] This is like a really dumb one.
[2378.28 → 2379.04] This is just like.
[2379.64 → 2382.42] So service is the last thing.
[2382.64 → 2385.40] And if we go way back to here, and we look at our effect.
[2385.82 → 2389.76] Services are the things that go kind of in this third requirements section.
[2389.98 → 2390.10] Right?
[2390.14 → 2392.44] So you're saying, oh, this one is going to touch HTTP.
[2392.74 → 2393.92] This one's going to hit users.
[2394.10 → 2395.04] This one's going to do whatever.
[2395.04 → 2396.24] So services.
[2397.18 → 2398.76] The cool thing for this.
[2399.06 → 2402.84] Like I said, this is like normally you could, we could talk about this for hours, but I'll go really short.
[2404.04 → 2407.96] You can create a service that just basically returns.
[2408.10 → 2409.48] The important part here is this.
[2409.48 → 2411.90] It returns something that has a lookup function.
[2412.52 → 2414.00] And I can use that later.
[2414.34 → 2417.56] Like inside of this.
[2417.76 → 2419.58] I could use cache dot lookup.
[2419.80 → 2422.02] I skipped some code inside here.
[2422.02 → 2422.18] Right.
[2422.24 → 2425.02] And so these services can talk to each other and some other stuff there.
[2425.02 → 2430.54] The thing, though, trash for this is you can wrap a different service.
[2430.72 → 2432.82] Like in this case, I'm wrapping the notion client.
[2433.12 → 2437.20] And then I would define a bunch of different functions that are like properly handled.
[2437.40 → 2443.98] I could write down the shape of anything that I wanted to make sure I'm actually getting back the right shaped code.
[2444.30 → 2444.56] Right.
[2444.60 → 2445.68] And the right shaped responses.
[2445.96 → 2449.26] And then the rest of it will work really nicely with effect.
[2449.26 → 2455.74] In fact, has easy way to go back and forth between like promises world and like effect world.
[2455.94 → 2456.04] Right.
[2456.04 → 2459.66] So if you're writing like a 5.0 8 stuff, you can move into those really easily.
[2460.94 → 2464.78] So there's a bunch of other stuff I'm not going to talk about, but that I've been having fun with.
[2466.12 → 2472.08] Like, for example, something that's really cool is it like really easily integrates with like open telemetry.
[2472.18 → 2478.54] So like this is I have like a trace and I hit this notion web hook, and it does all the tracing for me and like does all of this.
[2478.54 → 2483.36] That just happens like automatically by using stuff like this.
[2483.68 → 2489.14] You know if I make a function and I tag it with this, it'll automatically create spans and do all this other stuff.
[2489.60 → 2491.16] Observability, manage that.
[2491.32 → 2491.70] That's cool.
[2492.04 → 2493.32] That's actually super sick.
[2493.98 → 2494.12] Right.
[2494.14 → 2496.70] So it's like I don't know anything about those things.
[2496.76 → 2498.26] I'm too stupid to understand Hotel.
[2498.52 → 2499.32] Like I don't really get it.
[2499.34 → 2503.58] Can you have that enabled for like debug builds or like production debug builds versus production?
[2503.58 → 2509.42] Like, can you have it flip on and off versus like some crazy runtime code to be able to like insert it on and off?
[2509.46 → 2514.72] Because that'd be super cool to be like, I want to measure this production build, but I fundamentally don't want this all the time on.
[2514.80 → 2517.32] This is just like my one time run to be able to do some sort of measurements.
[2517.46 → 2519.06] You would just change it probably by.
[2519.30 → 2522.58] So actually, the way that you would do that is like you would pass in.
[2522.76 → 2525.30] I didn't talk about this, but the cool thing with requirements.
[2525.30 → 2525.58] Okay.
[2526.78 → 2527.00] Yeah.
[2527.14 → 2536.00] The cool thing with the like this requirements' thing for services is it says you need to provide it with something that has the same shape.
[2536.00 → 2541.68] So you could provide an open telemetry layer or like service that just is all no ops.
[2542.30 → 2542.70] Right.
[2542.74 → 2545.88] So then instead of actually doing anything, it would just like to call the function and not do anything.
[2545.94 → 2546.06] Right.
[2546.06 → 2551.60] Like TypeScript, you can't compile them out like you could if you were in C and you have a debug build versus this.
[2551.66 → 2551.76] Right.
[2551.76 → 2553.20] We don't have like macros like that.
[2553.20 → 2555.72] But I mean like I've heard of it.
[2555.80 → 2555.94] Okay.
[2555.94 → 2556.46] I've heard of this.
[2556.68 → 2561.04] But in, you know, in JavaScript land, calling a no op function, you've got bigger problems.
[2561.72 → 2566.98] Usually performance wise is you're willing to give away a free few free function calls.
[2567.06 → 2568.16] So, yes, you can do that.
[2568.22 → 2570.42] You can replace the different layers and all of this other stuff.
[2570.44 → 2574.60] So like actually like this one is from century.
[2574.74 → 2580.54] Like I just put in something that integrates with century for the like tracing and I just get that for free on the rest of my stuff.
[2580.54 → 2581.68] I wanted to switch to something else.
[2581.68 → 2585.84] I could just use a different like hotel provider for that, which is cool.
[2585.84 → 2591.28] So like, yes, Trash, you can wrap all of your external services to do that, which I think is nice.
[2592.92 → 2593.36] Yeah.
[2593.44 → 2597.02] So the last thing is also the commute.
[2597.26 → 2597.30] Whoops.
[2597.30 → 2600.18] The community is really nice, and I like them a lot.
[2600.30 → 2602.40] Shout out to people like Kit Langton.
[2602.62 → 2612.70] If you guys want to actually see a bunch of really cool stuff, he has a bunch of really cool like visual examples of like what the code does and then whether those things are okay.
[2612.86 → 2619.34] And you can check, you know, here's this piece of code and what it does so you can understand what's actually going on.
[2619.46 → 2620.22] Very cool.
[2620.22 → 2623.36] It's got sounds and other stuff, too, if you're playing it, which is nice.
[2623.50 → 2625.60] So you can check that out.
[2625.78 → 2627.16] Kit is really awesome.
[2627.80 → 2628.34] So, yeah.
[2628.46 → 2633.20] So my so anyway, I'm picking effect, and I'm excited.
[2633.34 → 2635.70] I've been writing a lot of it lately and having a good time.
[2636.10 → 2636.86] So there you go.
[2636.96 → 2638.00] That's a quick rundown, too.
[2638.08 → 2638.30] Sorry.
[2638.38 → 2639.42] I probably butchered it.
[2639.42 → 2640.34] I'm trying to go fast.
[2641.38 → 2642.22] No, that was awesome.
[2642.60 → 2643.98] If I was wrong, blame Kit.
[2644.26 → 2645.22] If I was wrong, blame Kit.
[2645.22 → 2646.92] Because he's the one who taught me the creator of effect.
[2647.20 → 2648.44] The creator of effect.
[2649.14 → 2650.34] Not Mike Agnaldo.
[2650.72 → 2651.00] Exactly.
[2652.58 → 2653.18] OK, there you go.
[2653.40 → 2654.32] Well, very good job.
[2654.38 → 2655.38] Oh, I didn't play Marimba.
[2655.66 → 2656.92] Casey, I'll play you a Marimba song now.
[2657.08 → 2657.58] Can you play it out?
[2657.58 → 2659.78] While you do that, while you do that, I have some things to say.
[2659.90 → 2661.42] So we got a treasure train.
[2661.68 → 2663.06] And so there's been a bunch of gifted subs.
[2663.14 → 2665.92] Remember, all gifted subs are going to be donated to Neovim at the end of the day.
[2665.92 → 2667.08] I'll calculate up the totals.
[2667.22 → 2672.06] I'll tweet out how much this particular stream went, and I'll send it out to everybody.
[2672.28 → 2674.94] All of that will be summed up and given out to Neovim.
[2675.22 → 2675.78] So thank you.
[2675.90 → 2681.26] If we get to level 30, I will personally give an additional $5,000 to Neovim.
[2682.40 → 2683.68] Is a treasure train a hype train?
[2683.68 → 2688.22] If all of you guys want to give a bunch, you will force me to give a bunch in a good way.
[2688.22 → 2688.46] So.
[2691.70 → 2694.68] Is a hype train a treasure train?
[2694.88 → 2695.36] Question mark?
[2696.50 → 2697.14] Or no?
[2698.04 → 2698.62] Hold on.
[2698.70 → 2699.84] We're just jamming right now.
[2705.22 → 2706.38] Oops.
[2706.78 → 2709.36] Oops.
[2709.70 → 2709.88] Oops.
[2726.28 → 2727.64] Ooh.
[2727.64 → 2728.20] Ooh.
[2728.20 → 2744.08] TJ's playing marimba for subs, people.
[2744.68 → 2746.00] Yeah, you can tell he knows this song.
[2746.04 → 2747.08] He's going crazy right now.
[2749.60 → 2752.00] Your call is important to us.
[2755.10 → 2757.26] Marimba can be more than hold music.
[2758.20 → 2761.04] That is so funny.
[2761.04 → 2762.04] Thank you.
[2763.04 → 2763.76] All right.
[2763.78 → 2764.72] Well, thank you, Hard Hat Hank.
[2764.80 → 2765.36] Thank you, Tristan.
[2765.46 → 2767.46] Thank you, Runamucker for the 20 gifted subs.
[2767.60 → 2768.78] Look, thank you, Jake.
[2769.10 → 2770.14] I, Thus.
[2770.54 → 2771.18] Appreciate that.
[2771.74 → 2772.66] TJ, keep going.
[2772.74 → 2774.32] We're listening while you do that.
[2774.82 → 2775.60] Rob, the fire keeper.
[2775.88 → 2776.36] Orange path.
[2776.82 → 2778.22] Tony, appreciate that.
[2778.30 → 2779.22] Defies with the 50.
[2779.38 → 2782.04] Spartan, my love for five gifted subs.
[2782.04 → 2784.42] Hexy96F for the 20.
[2784.72 → 2785.72] Code girl for the 20.
[2786.72 → 2787.82] Ian Den H.
[2787.88 → 2788.66] Thank you for the 20.
[2788.78 → 2791.40] Radius with the 50, but he did 50 just earlier.
[2791.92 → 2793.18] Woods and Goods.
[2793.22 → 2794.22] Thank you for the Twitch Prime.
[2794.32 → 2795.42] S'more with the 50.
[2795.54 → 2796.90] Defies all with the 50.
[2797.10 → 2798.26] Code girl with the 20.
[2798.88 → 2800.98] Mattia NT with the tier one.
[2801.14 → 2802.94] Dag MC with the Twitch Prime.
[2803.04 → 2804.42] Radius with the 50.
[2804.92 → 2806.46] And Radius with the Twitch Prime.
[2806.62 → 2807.46] 35 months.
[2807.56 → 2808.10] Skull thoughts.
[2808.18 → 2809.00] Hello, I thought I was late.
[2809.08 → 2809.56] No, you're not.
[2809.56 → 2810.54] Non-dairy neutrino.
[2810.62 → 2811.26] Thank you very much.
[2811.34 → 2812.74] And Twitch itself.
[2812.84 → 2814.84] Thank you for the 100 gifted subs.
[2815.18 → 2815.98] Thank you, everybody.
[2816.36 → 2817.04] Appreciate that.
[2817.10 → 2818.14] TJ, amazing.
[2818.36 → 2819.06] That was good.
[2819.20 → 2819.88] Marimba play.
[2820.18 → 2820.98] Appreciate that.
[2821.32 → 2824.66] I played that all with me, just tiny in the corner, too, like an idiot.
[2825.14 → 2826.04] Yeah, it was amazing.
[2826.74 → 2828.04] People were squinting.
[2828.94 → 2829.76] But it looked great.
[2830.36 → 2834.04] That's the only way an elf plays music, okay, is tiny in the corner, right?
[2834.04 → 2835.30] He's a background player.
[2835.48 → 2836.20] He's a background player.
[2836.22 → 2838.22] He's tiny, and he's usually in the corner.
[2838.22 → 2842.20] We're going with Harry Potter elves, too, because we want the thoroughly abused and disillusioned elves.
[2842.94 → 2843.30] Toby!
[2845.20 → 2845.60] Toby.
[2846.56 → 2847.20] Toby's dead.
[2847.22 → 2848.80] Toby did a good thing, Mr. Potter.
[2848.80 → 2849.26] R.I.P.
[2849.32 → 2849.62] Toby.
[2849.98 → 2850.24] Toby.
[2850.24 → 2851.08] R.I.P.
[2851.08 → 2852.28] My boy, Toby, dude.
[2853.68 → 2856.20] Good thing they definitely aren't going to kill the cute ones, right?
[2856.80 → 2858.04] Again, one more last thing.
[2858.10 → 2858.72] JOR, thank you.
[2858.96 → 2859.54] Nor MA.
[2859.66 → 2860.32] Appreciate that.
[2860.68 → 2861.12] 96F.
[2861.20 → 2862.10] Appreciate the 10.
[2862.20 → 2863.56] Abba Wack with the 20.
[2863.74 → 2864.76] Nazi with the 5.
[2864.88 → 2866.86] Mordor with the 5.
[2866.86 → 2867.66] And Rough Cookie.
[2868.02 → 2869.78] Appreciate the 5 gifted subs.
[2870.16 → 2871.36] We made it up to 20.
[2871.70 → 2875.22] Level 20, that's like the highest hype trend I've had in like a year, so that's incredible.
[2875.42 → 2876.48] So appreciate that, everybody.
[2877.32 → 2878.20] All will be going.
[2878.76 → 2879.08] Woo!
[2880.04 → 2881.18] To Neovim.
[2882.46 → 2882.84] All right.
[2883.22 → 2884.02] Should we go to the last?
[2884.02 → 2884.52] Prime, your turn.
[2885.22 → 2885.94] Is it my turn?
[2886.04 → 2886.72] Yeah, let's see it.
[2886.96 → 2887.20] All right.
[2887.20 → 2891.00] So I thought about this one for a little while because I wasn't really sure what to do.
[2891.70 → 2894.86] One of the hard parts I had is that I know so many people personally.
[2895.12 → 2898.74] It does make me feel a little bit bad selecting somebody if I know them personally.
[2898.96 → 2902.48] Like one that was on the list was HTMX.
[2902.54 → 2903.64] I really know Carson.
[2903.76 → 2904.50] I really like him.
[2904.58 → 2905.60] I think he's fantastic.
[2906.00 → 2906.50] Good choice.
[2906.50 → 2912.46] And so I kind of sit there, and I want to give like HTMX because I think it's a really valuable library.
[2912.62 → 2915.48] But at the exact same time, it makes me feel weird.
[2915.52 → 2917.20] I don't want people being like, look at that.
[2917.26 → 2920.06] It's like nepotism or something like that or cronyism, right?
[2920.06 → 2922.70] I want to make sure I pick a library that...
[2922.70 → 2924.28] Big open source Santa.
[2924.76 → 2925.22] Yeah, yeah.
[2925.22 → 2928.58] Big open source Santa with supporting HTMX laser eyes.
[2928.58 → 2931.94] And so I wanted to really think about what is the best possible...
[2931.94 → 2938.80] What is the open source that I use all the time that truly has made a bigger difference, I think, in my life than anything else?
[2939.16 → 2943.96] And so then it got me to think like, what is the one piece of open source that has literally changed my life?
[2944.52 → 2946.16] And so I chose Falcon, obviously, for me.
[2946.28 → 2951.12] Now, the one that has actually literally changed my life is OBS.
[2951.12 → 2952.78] I don't know why I believed you for a split second.
[2953.18 → 2953.48] I know.
[2953.48 → 2954.02] That's so funny.
[2954.02 → 2959.48] OBS is the one piece of software that has allowed me to quit my job and do this stuff full-time.
[2959.60 → 2963.86] Like, OBS is single-handedly the greatest piece of open source software that I've ever had in my life.
[2964.26 → 2966.90] And they have genuinely changed my life.
[2967.28 → 2973.00] And so I feel like it'd be a big miss if I did not give back to them.
[2973.04 → 2977.44] And I realize I probably should have given to them more, actually, after sitting down and really thinking about it.
[2977.80 → 2980.30] That these guys have changed not just my life,
[2980.30 → 2985.58] but, like, there's countless amount of lives that have been changed by OBS that have actually made people change trajectory,
[2985.82 → 2988.56] careers, slash made people hear about Trash Dev.
[2988.68 → 2991.00] And so, like, there's been so many things that they have done.
[2991.70 → 2995.30] And I think that they very certainly deserve it.
[2995.88 → 2998.12] And so I would just like to say thank you to OBS.
[2998.28 → 3001.66] And I got to meet some of the OBS people at Twitch Con, and they were genuinely super nice.
[3001.66 → 3003.48] Oh, so it is nepotism.
[3003.90 → 3004.54] It is.
[3004.54 → 3004.70] Yeah.
[3005.90 → 3007.82] Watch my stream in Christmastime, okay?
[3007.82 → 3010.38] But I don't remember any of their names, so I think that counts.
[3010.74 → 3012.06] Like, long as I don't remember their names.
[3012.36 → 3018.26] You know, it was just an accidental run-in, a serendipitous run-in at the end of Twitch Con in the Netherlands.
[3019.34 → 3021.10] And, TJ, you were there, if I'm not mistaken.
[3021.14 → 3023.12] So I don't know what this big talk about not knowing them.
[3024.76 → 3025.90] But, yeah, so they were just absolutely fantastic.
[3025.90 → 3026.66] I'm an elf, dude.
[3026.74 → 3027.20] Who's TJ?
[3028.14 → 3029.76] Sorry, elf J.
[3030.74 → 3031.06] Yeah.
[3032.20 → 3032.84] Appreciate that.
[3032.84 → 3033.98] Are you on a shelf, by the way?
[3034.88 → 3036.98] Oh, that would have been so smart.
[3036.98 → 3038.54] Why did I not think to do that?
[3038.58 → 3043.56] Dude, you probably brought a shelf in and just been sitting on the side, like, away from your microphone, kicking your little feet.
[3043.58 → 3046.48] My favourite one, did you see the one ZANU posted?
[3046.98 → 3050.96] Vegan on a vegan, where it's vegan on an Elmore shoulder.
[3052.38 → 3053.14] That's pretty good.
[3053.72 → 3054.30] So there you go.
[3054.40 → 3055.50] That would be mine.
[3055.60 → 3056.88] I feel like it is fitting.
[3057.10 → 3060.42] It is absolutely fantastic, and it is the right choice to make.
[3061.66 → 3062.54] I love that.
[3062.84 → 3063.64] Great option.
[3063.64 → 3066.14] I was going to suggest the same project, but I was on mute, actually.
[3067.06 → 3067.46] Okay.
[3068.42 → 3070.22] Does OBS have, like, a...
[3070.22 → 3072.64] Like, how many people actively work on it, or is it just...
[3072.64 → 3077.18] I know there's a lot of people that actively work on it, and they mix around in the community.
[3077.36 → 3078.64] So I figured, like, that is...
[3078.64 → 3080.02] That's the one to do.
[3081.00 → 3081.54] That's awesome.
[3082.40 → 3086.64] Yeah, I didn't come up with a really sweet presentation, but I did, you know...
[3088.02 → 3088.48] I felt like that.
[3088.48 → 3089.00] What are you talking about?
[3089.02 → 3091.22] This whole thing was a presentation for OBS.
[3091.22 → 3091.62] True.
[3092.30 → 3092.56] True.
[3092.72 → 3093.12] Ooh.
[3094.26 → 3095.22] Ho, ho, ho.
[3095.76 → 3096.10] All right.
[3096.14 → 3103.92] So I think those are our four picks, which means we go into the super bonus round time.
[3104.00 → 3104.40] Yeah.
[3105.36 → 3105.68] Love it.
[3105.68 → 3106.46] I'm very excited about this.
[3106.54 → 3107.30] So I'm going to do...
[3107.30 → 3109.46] Give me a little second, Josh, take this part out.
[3109.54 → 3112.06] I'm going to go in here, and I'm going to actually try to get...
[3112.06 → 3117.16] I'm going to go to my other OBS stand-up and see if I can get that one to work to where
[3117.16 → 3120.60] it has TJ and everybody on the side and small ones.
[3121.52 → 3121.78] Okay.
[3121.88 → 3123.40] That still kind of works, so that's good.
[3123.74 → 3124.06] All right.
[3124.08 → 3124.64] So this is good.
[3124.78 → 3124.98] Okay.
[3125.02 → 3125.20] Okay.
[3125.24 → 3127.32] So I believe I just need to swap myself over to here.
[3128.16 → 3130.82] And now I believe...
[3130.82 → 3131.26] All right.
[3131.30 → 3132.02] So look at this.
[3132.02 → 3133.44] This is looking pretty good, right?
[3133.90 → 3134.26] Wow.
[3135.20 → 3135.56] Yeah.
[3135.64 → 3137.10] It's not the best, okay?
[3137.14 → 3139.66] I don't really make all the rules here, but I tried my hardest.
[3139.66 → 3141.06] Oh, Santa's got to be big.
[3141.12 → 3141.60] I get it.
[3141.66 → 3143.38] Just nothing about the little guys.
[3143.50 → 3143.80] Okay.
[3143.80 → 3146.76] TJ, you know, size does matter.
[3146.84 → 3147.10] Okay.
[3147.20 → 3149.16] So let's go to the main.
[3149.26 → 3151.84] There's Elf on a Shelf, so hopefully this can show up.
[3152.72 → 3154.08] Let's go over...
[3154.08 → 3156.54] Yeah, this is Elf on a Shelf, by the way, if you're wondering.
[3156.98 → 3157.50] Thank you.
[3157.50 → 3158.10] Thank you.
[3158.10 → 3158.32] You know what?
[3158.32 → 3160.54] I don't even want to show them.
[3160.66 → 3160.92] Okay.
[3162.22 → 3162.50] All right.
[3162.50 → 3163.50] So let's first start off.
[3163.58 → 3164.48] I guess we'll bring up...
[3164.48 → 3166.54] Do we want to do YouTube or Twitch first?
[3168.20 → 3170.00] We got to give YouTube a lot of time.
[3171.12 → 3173.22] It's going to take them like 30 minutes to figure out the game.
[3173.80 → 3174.08] Okay.
[3174.16 → 3175.66] You need to tell them to start now.
[3175.92 → 3176.22] Okay.
[3176.22 → 3176.54] Okay.
[3176.80 → 3179.88] YouTube, I want you guys to start discussing what you want to do.
[3179.98 → 3180.84] So we'll start with...
[3180.84 → 3182.02] That is not going to go well.
[3182.34 → 3183.80] I want you guys to start discussing.
[3183.98 → 3185.22] Please try not to...
[3185.22 → 3186.72] Please refrain from racial slurs.
[3188.84 → 3189.28] Twitch.
[3190.40 → 3193.38] That's actually a shout-out to, if you guys remember, Celebrity Jeopardy.
[3194.02 → 3196.02] Welcome back, everybody, to Celebrity Jeopardy.
[3196.02 → 3197.16] We'll be going...
[3197.16 → 3200.36] Ask the contestants to please refrain from using racial slurs.
[3200.46 → 3201.38] That was a Sean Connery one.
[3201.94 → 3202.20] Anyway.
[3202.20 → 3202.52] Okay.
[3202.70 → 3203.32] So Twitch.
[3204.02 → 3206.66] You guys get the chance to pick out something.
[3206.76 → 3208.48] So I want Twitch to say...
[3208.48 → 3211.52] Say all of your favourite projects that you want to give money to.
[3212.82 → 3213.56] And then...
[3213.56 → 3214.26] Thank you, Disco.
[3214.62 → 3216.20] And so everybody say your favourite projects.
[3216.30 → 3217.18] And we're going to watch it.
[3217.70 → 3219.46] And I want all of us to look at this.
[3219.52 → 3222.72] And whatever one is there that we see the most of, we'll just pick it.
[3223.62 → 3224.02] That's...
[3224.02 → 3224.20] Wow.
[3224.24 → 3224.48] Okay.
[3224.96 → 3225.96] We don't even have a poll.
[3226.08 → 3226.78] There's not even going to be a poll.
[3226.78 → 3227.14] We will.
[3227.26 → 3227.48] We will.
[3227.48 → 3229.12] We're going to narrow to four, Casey.
[3229.24 → 3229.84] We're going to narrow to four.
[3229.84 → 3231.52] Also, I posted that gist.
[3231.76 → 3232.64] Can we post that?
[3232.68 → 3235.84] Because I have a list of projects for people to consider there.
[3236.50 → 3236.80] Yep.
[3237.08 → 3237.24] Okay.
[3237.32 → 3241.26] So I see a decent amount of Ray libs.
[3242.70 → 3243.06] Pigs.
[3243.88 → 3245.10] Ray lib is a good choice.
[3245.94 → 3246.08] Odin.
[3246.08 → 3246.76] I see Odin a bunch.
[3246.76 → 3247.62] I saw quite a few Odin's.
[3247.80 → 3249.44] I saw HTMX, too.
[3249.98 → 3251.60] Hyperland, I see quite a few as well.
[3252.10 → 3252.34] Yeah.
[3252.34 → 3255.58] People really do seem to like Hyperland.
[3255.58 → 3257.42] I saw Blender quite a few times as well.
[3258.52 → 3259.52] So could we say the following?
[3260.22 → 3261.38] Could we say the following?
[3261.46 → 3262.22] We're going to create a poll.
[3263.36 → 3266.08] Which is going to be a charity, right?
[3266.82 → 3269.36] Should I also do a prediction?
[3269.78 → 3271.60] So that way people can bet as well.
[3272.98 → 3275.82] We should get it on Polymarket.
[3276.16 → 3277.40] Quickly on Polymarket, go.
[3277.78 → 3278.14] Okay.
[3278.24 → 3278.82] So I will do...
[3278.82 → 3280.72] I believe I saw Blender quite a few times in there.
[3280.74 → 3281.38] Is that fine to say?
[3282.26 → 3283.22] Yeah, I saw quite a few.
[3283.66 → 3283.98] All right.
[3284.64 → 3288.10] Twitch, why don't you keep on saying a bunch?
[3288.14 → 3290.04] Because if I scroll up here, we can see...
[3290.04 → 3291.18] I see a bunch of Ray libs.
[3292.34 → 3293.34] A lot of Ray libs.
[3293.68 → 3293.96] Hyperlands.
[3294.08 → 3295.58] I saw Blender at the beginning.
[3295.66 → 3296.36] A lot of Ray libs.
[3296.36 → 3298.36] Ray libs and Hyperland do seem very popular.
[3299.06 → 3299.28] All right.
[3300.60 → 3305.20] I think Ray lib, Odin, and Hyperland are the three that I'm seeing the most.
[3305.52 → 3305.76] Okay.
[3307.98 → 3309.20] Yeah, I'm fine with saying that.
[3309.30 → 3310.56] I see a lot of Odin.
[3310.56 → 3311.94] I see a Aquarius in there.
[3313.54 → 3314.16] There's a few.
[3314.40 → 3314.92] There's a few.
[3315.58 → 3315.82] Yeah.
[3316.44 → 3316.76] Okay.
[3316.82 → 3317.02] Okay.
[3317.02 → 3318.48] So we're going to say Odin.
[3321.98 → 3322.26] Ray lib.
[3324.70 → 3324.98] Hyperland.
[3325.48 → 3328.04] I'm going to put Blender in there because at the beginning there was like 20 Blenders
[3328.04 → 3328.52] right in the row.
[3328.86 → 3329.06] Yeah.
[3329.08 → 3329.18] Yeah.
[3329.18 → 3331.48] I think people were assuming you were since you already said that.
[3331.76 → 3332.02] Yeah.
[3332.44 → 3332.80] All right.
[3332.80 → 3333.22] There we go.
[3333.56 → 3334.48] So I'm going to put those in.
[3334.52 → 3335.50] Anyone else that I was...
[3335.50 → 3339.28] I thought I saw Big a few times in there, but I could be fine if there was a different
[3339.28 → 3339.62] choice.
[3340.66 → 3342.42] Quite a few HTMXs.
[3343.36 → 3348.12] I mean, you should allow people to vote for HTMX just because you don't want to give it
[3348.12 → 3348.84] as your choice.
[3349.06 → 3349.88] I think the people can be...
[3349.88 → 3349.90] True.
[3349.90 → 3351.48] Then I'm influencing the vote.
[3351.66 → 3352.14] Fox Popular.
[3352.14 → 3354.76] How are you influencing the vote?
[3354.98 → 3359.10] Because I said something and so people either will do what I say or do the exact opposite
[3359.10 → 3359.58] of what I say.
[3359.70 → 3360.24] It's one of the...
[3360.24 → 3360.52] Okay.
[3360.62 → 3361.48] That's cancel each other out.
[3361.54 → 3362.66] Those will cancel each other out.
[3362.72 → 3367.88] The people who don't want you to have happiness in life will cancel out the people who do.
[3368.40 → 3369.20] So it's a reverse one.
[3369.84 → 3372.12] Ray lib was actually my other one that I wanted to support.
[3372.22 → 3373.00] I just didn't mention it.
[3373.10 → 3373.30] Great.
[3373.44 → 3375.24] Now you're ruining it further.
[3376.04 → 3376.78] That's okay.
[3377.20 → 3378.68] I was like, why did you even say that?
[3378.80 → 3379.76] Why did you say it?
[3379.76 → 3382.72] To be completely fair, the only one I never thought about was Blender.
[3383.74 → 3385.44] That's the only one that I didn't think about.
[3385.56 → 3387.42] Now you're just influencing this whole thing.
[3387.74 → 3390.22] I had to because if I'm going to do it once, I got to do it for all.
[3390.30 → 3390.74] Here we go.
[3391.86 → 3392.24] All right.
[3393.00 → 3395.54] So right now, Hyperland is in the lead.
[3395.64 → 3395.74] Okay.
[3395.78 → 3396.84] We got Hyperland in the first place.
[3396.94 → 3398.78] So Hyperland is now sitting out at 18 places.
[3398.94 → 3400.06] Blender is in at 13.
[3400.22 → 3402.24] Blender is the second highest rated one.
[3402.68 → 3403.72] Ray lib sitting in third.
[3403.82 → 3407.94] Oh, Ray lib has taken second of HTMX and Odin very far in the past.
[3407.94 → 3411.28] Their horses aren't very fast, but Ray lib and Blender looking very, very close.
[3411.60 → 3413.18] We are coming up to the wire right here.
[3413.26 → 3416.88] We got Hyperland in a very strong lead, but Ray lib catching up.
[3417.16 → 3419.08] Ray lib's catching up even faster and faster now.
[3419.16 → 3419.88] Oh my gosh.
[3419.96 → 3422.22] But there was a little bit of juice left in that Hyperland.
[3422.32 → 3424.88] Now it's coming down to just Ray lib and Hyperland.
[3425.08 → 3427.16] Blender is even sitting far out on this one.
[3427.26 → 3430.80] And it looks like it's going to be going to Hyperland.
[3433.36 → 3433.76] Dang.
[3434.08 → 3435.12] That was a pretty good commentary.
[3435.78 → 3436.18] Thank you.
[3436.18 → 3444.94] Well, what we see in the past year, Prime, is that on Mondays, it does appear in the past 37 games that Hyperland's played.
[3445.06 → 3447.74] Mondays where it's rainy, they do seem to come out on top.
[3447.88 → 3450.38] They've got a 37-12 record on Monday.
[3451.20 → 3451.90] There we go.
[3452.06 → 3452.38] Nice.
[3452.54 → 3454.18] So Twitch officially has picked Hyperland.
[3454.90 → 3457.38] So Twitch has picked Hyperland.
[3458.34 → 3458.68] Okay.
[3459.10 → 3459.50] Interesting.
[3459.70 → 3460.04] Officially.
[3460.52 → 3461.00] Officially.
[3461.32 → 3461.66] Rigged.
[3462.62 → 3462.98] Rigged.
[3463.62 → 3465.50] Already we got rigged calls on the play.
[3465.50 → 3466.00] Rigged.
[3466.18 → 3469.04] I don't know about that one.
[3469.12 → 3469.78] Okay, YouTube.
[3470.12 → 3476.04] Now that YouTube has had the chance to think about it, YouTube, I want you guys to start spamming what you think.
[3476.86 → 3477.22] Yes.
[3478.12 → 3481.14] Because I guess I could start way up here and kind of start scrolling down.
[3481.52 → 3481.98] What do we see?
[3482.02 → 3482.38] So here we go.
[3482.38 → 3483.44] I'm just going to go nice and slow.
[3483.52 → 3484.94] So we got some of this right here.
[3486.14 → 3487.74] Problem is people can spam a lot more.
[3487.74 → 3490.20] There are not a lot of like YouTube controls for spamming.
[3491.12 → 3491.62] That's okay.
[3491.70 → 3492.00] That's okay.
[3492.00 → 3492.02] That's okay.
[3492.02 → 3492.36] We can.
[3492.46 → 3494.30] We're processing that in our brains.
[3495.30 → 3497.32] It's hard to read for chat though.
[3497.40 → 3497.92] Oh, whoops.
[3497.92 → 3501.64] Because you're blocking half of YouTube on us right now.
[3501.74 → 3502.38] Just as a heads-up.
[3502.88 → 3503.02] Yep.
[3503.16 → 3503.62] There you go.
[3506.14 → 3506.64] There we go.
[3506.64 → 3509.64] Okay, so we got a bunch of Ray Libs kind of floating in to begin with.
[3509.72 → 3511.44] But it looks like a little bit of spam.
[3511.60 → 3512.24] A little bit of Blender.
[3513.94 → 3514.06] Okay.
[3514.36 → 3516.60] Decent distribution of Ray Lib people though.
[3517.06 → 3517.26] Yeah.
[3517.60 → 3517.84] Okay.
[3517.92 → 3519.68] So I'd say Ray Lib gets a second chance.
[3520.02 → 3522.00] And it looks like we got an FFM peg in there.
[3522.04 → 3522.80] We only got one.
[3524.74 → 3525.10] Sword.
[3525.14 → 3526.18] We got some Swords in there.
[3526.60 → 3526.82] All right.
[3526.86 → 3527.14] All right.
[3527.64 → 3528.64] All right.
[3528.64 → 3532.54] So what do we think here?
[3532.80 → 3533.26] What are we thinking?
[3535.16 → 3536.62] They look like the same choices.
[3536.82 → 3537.30] Lady Bird.
[3537.80 → 3539.38] I did see some Lady Bird in there.
[3540.50 → 3541.98] A lot of Ray Libs though.
[3542.86 → 3543.68] I've seen her water.
[3543.68 → 3544.70] I think Blender wants to make a second chance.
[3545.12 → 3545.90] Looks like Blender is wanting.
[3546.74 → 3547.68] I see some Bill Gates.
[3547.82 → 3548.04] All right.
[3548.12 → 3548.34] All right.
[3549.76 → 3551.18] Bill Gates, the most important one.
[3551.26 → 3551.50] All right.
[3551.56 → 3552.12] So here we go.
[3552.50 → 3553.42] So we'll start a poll.
[3554.22 → 3556.12] And we will do charity.
[3556.46 → 3556.62] Right?
[3558.64 → 3559.74] Charity.
[3559.90 → 3561.58] And we will do Ray Lib.
[3562.72 → 3563.66] We will do.
[3563.78 → 3564.64] What's the next one?
[3565.72 → 3566.16] Lady Bird.
[3566.92 → 3567.36] Blender.
[3568.06 → 3568.76] Lady Bird.
[3568.90 → 3571.26] For those that don't know, Lady Bird is an op.
[3571.36 → 3572.32] Or not an operating system.
[3572.42 → 3573.36] Really, it's an operating system.
[3573.48 → 3574.48] It is a browser.
[3575.28 → 3575.50] Yeah.
[3575.68 → 3576.04] It was.
[3576.16 → 3576.76] It was an operating system.
[3577.00 → 3580.72] It is a browser in which is going to be truly open source.
[3580.98 → 3582.32] And not filled with AIs.
[3582.50 → 3584.52] And just be a browser for the sake of being a browser.
[3584.92 → 3585.86] And not owned by Google.
[3586.20 → 3586.98] So I know.
[3587.24 → 3587.78] Crazy times.
[3587.92 → 3588.62] This could be crazy times.
[3588.64 → 3590.98] I can throw Bill Gates in there as well.
[3591.16 → 3592.40] We could throw Bill Gates in there.
[3592.44 → 3594.76] No, because they'll pick Bill Gates.
[3594.98 → 3596.82] They will actually pick Bill Gates.
[3597.00 → 3599.46] We have to abide by the results of the poll.
[3599.96 → 3600.10] Yeah.
[3600.20 → 3604.06] And I don't want to open up anything owned by Bill Gates and give money to a GitHub.
[3605.00 → 3606.62] I mean, GitHub might need it.
[3606.96 → 3607.16] All right.
[3607.18 → 3607.82] Anybody else?
[3610.14 → 3611.00] Here's a question.
[3611.00 → 3619.06] Do the folks who donated this money to be given away, could they also donate a CEO?
[3619.06 → 3621.50] In which case we could gift it to GitHub.
[3622.18 → 3624.78] I would love to see Sam running GitHub.
[3625.10 → 3627.34] They do need a CEO is my understanding.
[3628.48 → 3630.82] They have like no leadership apparently, right?
[3630.88 → 3634.46] Like it's just kind of like floating around inside Microsoft orgs or something.
[3635.32 → 3637.80] Casey, you got to do the play-by-play here.
[3638.30 → 3639.24] Do the horse race.
[3640.16 → 3640.58] Oh, he made it small.
[3640.58 → 3641.18] I don't know how I'm saying.
[3641.18 → 3642.02] He made it small.
[3642.40 → 3644.38] All I see is a super blurry prime.
[3644.38 → 3645.96] I can't even read the text on the prime.
[3646.02 → 3646.74] It just blurred out.
[3647.18 → 3648.30] It collapsed anyway.
[3648.62 → 3649.06] You can't even.
[3649.12 → 3649.94] It just shows the winner.
[3650.08 → 3651.16] Lady Bird at 39%.
[3651.16 → 3652.62] Lady Bird at 37%.
[3652.62 → 3653.20] Lady Bird.
[3653.32 → 3653.66] Lady Bird.
[3653.74 → 3654.06] Lady Bird.
[3654.14 → 3655.18] We can't see the rest of the options.
[3655.18 → 3655.66] Why did it collapse everything?
[3656.14 → 3656.96] Come on, YouTube.
[3659.02 → 3660.14] Should donate it to YouTube.
[3660.32 → 3660.68] Fix them.
[3661.74 → 3662.06] 38%.
[3662.06 → 3662.60] 39%.
[3662.60 → 3663.34] 38%.
[3663.34 → 3665.04] That's a pretty big.
[3665.68 → 3666.68] Where did Prime go?
[3667.44 → 3668.94] He said pee right back.
[3669.24 → 3670.04] Yeah, that's my guess.
[3672.10 → 3673.70] There's no peeing in Christmas.
[3674.50 → 3674.82] True.
[3674.98 → 3678.10] You think Santa Claus has time to pee while he's delivering presents to everyone
[3678.10 → 3678.98] in the entire world?
[3679.42 → 3679.52] No.
[3679.52 → 3684.54] To be fair, Casey, if he does have the ability to travel around the whole world in one night,
[3684.54 → 3685.84] he probably does have time to go pee.
[3687.34 → 3688.42] I mean, that's one way to think about it.
[3688.42 → 3690.64] Because he must have some time distortion device, right?
[3690.80 → 3691.30] So it's like.
[3691.44 → 3696.14] Or he just has like a little like, you know, a little cup that he pees in, like an Amazon
[3696.14 → 3696.98] delivery driver.
[3697.78 → 3698.94] It could be.
[3699.04 → 3699.36] It could be.
[3699.44 → 3701.98] Maybe he's picking up all the presents from the Amazon delivery warehouses.
[3702.10 → 3702.98] It probably is.
[3702.98 → 3706.86] It probably is just like his sleigh just has liked one of those little smiles written on the
[3706.86 → 3707.30] side of it.
[3707.38 → 3707.86] You know what I'm saying?
[3708.38 → 3709.32] Real question, though.
[3709.36 → 3712.78] Have you ever been in a situation where you had to pee like in a cup because you're just
[3712.78 → 3713.78] stuck in traffic or something?
[3714.78 → 3715.08] No.
[3716.00 → 3717.12] Trash, you're about to tell us.
[3717.16 → 3717.58] Yeah, me either.
[3718.26 → 3718.98] Me either.
[3719.90 → 3720.58] I was so excited about that.
[3720.58 → 3724.02] I mean, I've been close, but I was like so scared of like the consequence of doing it.
[3724.12 → 3725.68] Of just like spilling it like all over my lap.
[3725.80 → 3726.52] Just be tearing it up.
[3727.86 → 3728.52] No way.
[3729.18 → 3729.70] No way.
[3729.70 → 3732.16] I am shocked that Lady Bird has done so well.
[3732.44 → 3734.58] It's up to Lady Bird and Ray lib.
[3734.70 → 3736.40] I'll give YouTube one more minute.
[3736.40 → 3741.92] But so because YouTube, you know, they take a long time.
[3742.68 → 3743.16] They do.
[3743.16 → 3745.16] And so we'll let we'll let them have a moment.
[3745.38 → 3750.24] So Ray lib or Lady Bird, you guys need to figure it out and put your votes in.
[3750.44 → 3753.14] I like how nobody even bothered to look at my list.
[3753.26 → 3754.90] I spent all this time putting together to list.
[3755.34 → 3756.96] Casey, we put we showed it on screen.
[3757.10 → 3757.30] I think.
[3757.38 → 3760.10] And we put it in the chat multiple times.
[3760.10 → 3760.70] No one cares.
[3760.70 → 3761.50] It's pinned right now.
[3761.50 → 3761.80] No one cares about my list.
[3761.88 → 3762.66] They don't care about me.
[3762.74 → 3763.60] They don't care about my list.
[3763.70 → 3764.60] I know when I'm not alone.
[3764.84 → 3765.26] It's fine.
[3765.92 → 3766.84] Don't worry about it.
[3767.20 → 3767.64] It's fine.
[3767.74 → 3768.92] I'm not taking it personally.
[3769.56 → 3769.66] Casey, we already said.
[3769.66 → 3771.58] I said the Louis JIT pick was great.
[3772.06 → 3772.26] Yeah.
[3772.26 → 3772.46] You know.
[3772.56 → 3774.56] I specifically said Louis JIT was great.
[3774.92 → 3777.40] You know, I'm not going to I'm not going to have hurt feelings about this.
[3777.54 → 3778.88] You know, just that no one cares.
[3778.88 → 3780.44] You guys ruined Casey's Christmas.
[3780.44 → 3781.14] That's fine.
[3781.48 → 3783.50] You know, it's the last time we're seeing Casey on this.
[3783.50 → 3784.34] You know, it's fine.
[3784.38 → 3784.84] It's good.
[3785.00 → 3785.84] Don't worry about it.
[3785.94 → 3786.34] It's good.
[3786.92 → 3787.30] All right.
[3787.36 → 3787.62] I'm not.
[3787.72 → 3788.32] I'm not hurt.
[3788.40 → 3789.48] I'm not heartbroken about it.
[3789.66 → 3791.12] I'm not going to cry myself to sleep tonight.
[3791.82 → 3792.34] That's good.
[3792.34 → 3793.64] You know, that's good to hear, Casey.
[3793.70 → 3795.34] I'm glad that you're doing OK with it.
[3795.42 → 3800.40] I will say that you're quite confusing because votes are going both up and down.
[3800.56 → 3802.90] So that is a little confusing to have them go back down.
[3802.94 → 3803.78] But we are up to five.
[3803.78 → 3804.32] I'm going to go.
[3805.00 → 3805.68] We're going to go.
[3805.68 → 3809.24] This is this kind of American democracy.
[3809.40 → 3809.58] You're running.
[3809.58 → 3810.74] What's going on?
[3810.74 → 3811.30] What's going on here?
[3811.36 → 3811.86] Oh, it's Google.
[3811.86 → 3812.74] The votes are coming in.
[3812.82 → 3813.26] They're going out.
[3813.26 → 3814.42] They're coming in again.
[3814.54 → 3815.10] They're going out.
[3815.12 → 3815.88] They're getting disqualified.
[3816.64 → 3817.84] All right.
[3817.86 → 3818.34] Here we go.
[3818.48 → 3819.82] So we officially.
[3820.16 → 3820.80] Oh, nice.
[3821.16 → 3821.60] There it is.
[3822.00 → 3824.04] It officially goes to Lady Bird.
[3824.60 → 3825.26] All right.
[3825.42 → 3825.86] Lady Bird.
[3826.30 → 3828.04] From YouTube to Lady Bird.
[3828.18 → 3828.54] Let's go.
[3829.62 → 3830.48] Great choice.
[3832.74 → 3834.10] Absolutely fantastic.
[3835.16 → 3835.78] All right.
[3835.88 → 3838.68] So, TJ, I believe we have a little.
[3838.68 → 3840.00] I was just going to go look up.
[3840.14 → 3843.52] Look, look, look up our number for where it's at right now.
[3843.98 → 3844.52] All right, everybody.
[3844.62 → 3846.38] So we got a little extra surprise.
[3847.12 → 3847.84] Hold on one second.
[3847.96 → 3849.32] I realized I left off my hood.
[3850.52 → 3851.36] All right, TJ.
[3851.56 → 3853.70] You want to give like a little bit of a background to this?
[3854.30 → 3856.56] So this is a super bonus one that I was talking about.
[3856.62 → 3857.66] The one that nobody knows about.
[3858.14 → 3859.26] Including us, by the way.
[3859.34 → 3860.68] No one told me about this.
[3860.68 → 3860.84] Or me.
[3861.06 → 3861.62] Actually, a lot of people know about it.
[3861.62 → 3862.52] Me and Casey never know.
[3862.52 → 3867.24] I was like, we've talked about it before, but we just haven't told people where we're at right now.
[3867.34 → 3874.92] So for those of you who don't know, you've seen Prime in his wonderful, beautiful, amazing, handsome Arch sweater lately.
[3875.20 → 3875.78] You've been seeing it.
[3875.78 → 3884.46] And when we asked Arch if we could use the trademark, we said we'd love to be able to give you guys back some money for using the trademark on the stuff.
[3884.72 → 3889.76] So we're going to split with them 50% of the profits from what we've been selling.
[3890.02 → 3895.76] And so that comes to about, roughly speaking, there are a few more days left in the year for this.
[3895.84 → 3900.64] But it will be about $7,000 that we'll also get to give to Arch.
[3900.64 → 3904.38] So we'll be sending them a check as well, which is very exciting.
[3904.56 → 3905.80] So shout out, Arch.
[3906.10 → 3910.56] We're going to be sending money to, I guess it's called like the Arch Linux Project or something.
[3910.64 → 3912.00] I don't remember their legal name.
[3912.26 → 3915.58] But the people who are actually running it and making it happen, we talked to a bunch of them.
[3915.88 → 3916.72] And so that's exciting.
[3916.78 → 3918.08] So we're excited to be able to do that too.
[3918.28 → 3919.38] That's because of you guys.
[3919.42 → 3920.68] That's from you guys buying the shirt.
[3920.86 → 3921.80] So shout out to you.
[3921.96 → 3922.86] You're helping Arch.
[3923.18 → 3926.68] Now, I would just like to suggest, if I may.
[3927.04 → 3927.36] Yes.
[3927.48 → 3927.62] Okay.
[3927.62 → 3934.46] That if you are going to give money to Arch, you should give money to Arch in a way appropriate to Arch.
[3934.62 → 3940.46] Like first, you should have to convert that money into like hard currency.
[3941.00 → 3947.78] Then it should have to go through some kind of like a transfer process into like a foreign currency.
[3948.56 → 3949.82] And then it should have to get deposit.
[3950.50 → 3953.46] I just want to say, don't launder it though.
[3954.00 → 3956.60] Because Arch is not about that life.
[3957.12 → 3957.56] Yeah.
[3957.92 → 3959.34] Not about that clean life.
[3961.72 → 3962.08] Sorry.
[3962.90 → 3964.12] Anyway, continue, Casey.
[3964.74 → 3965.22] I'm just saying.
[3965.34 → 3973.46] So it should be, it should be like, you should have to do a fair bit of like specific technical steps to make this donation.
[3974.06 → 3975.62] Otherwise, it doesn't feel right.
[3975.86 → 3977.70] Like if you were to just like, you know what I'm saying?
[3978.04 → 3978.62] It should feel Arch.
[3978.62 → 3979.22] If you go to PayPal.
[3979.22 → 3979.42] PayPal.
[3979.78 → 3979.94] Yeah.
[3979.98 → 3982.00] We have to build our own payment processor first.
[3982.00 → 3982.32] Yeah.
[3982.32 → 3982.60] And then we can send money.
[3982.60 → 3983.50] It's got to be something.
[3983.78 → 3983.96] Yeah.
[3984.30 → 3984.44] Yeah.
[3984.44 → 3986.58] Then you got to use your sphincter's print fingerprint.
[3988.18 → 3988.58] Thank you.
[3988.78 → 3989.84] Your sphincter print.
[3989.84 → 3990.00] Yeah.
[3990.14 → 3991.84] You got to get your sphincter printed there.
[3991.88 → 3992.74] Sphincter printed screen.
[3992.82 → 3993.42] Really quickly.
[3993.42 → 4002.34] Now, if I'm not mistaken, anyone who's currently been on the Omar chi hype train is also sort of an Arch user now, right?
[4002.80 → 4003.16] Yes.
[4003.38 → 4003.68] True.
[4003.88 → 4004.68] By accent, really.
[4004.76 → 4006.88] Sort of by, they are downstream of it.
[4006.88 → 4013.32] Is that the only popular distribution besides Arch itself that is Arch derived?
[4013.64 → 4014.88] Or are there others now?
[4015.90 → 4016.36] That's a good question.
[4016.36 → 4016.78] Catchy OS.
[4016.90 → 4018.24] Is Catchy OS Arch derived?
[4018.54 → 4022.80] Steam OS, if I'm not mistaken, is also Arch, correct?
[4023.56 → 4023.68] Yes.
[4023.68 → 4024.02] Is that true?
[4024.56 → 4025.02] Yes.
[4025.10 → 4025.82] Steam OS.
[4026.06 → 4026.42] Madero.
[4026.98 → 4027.46] Madero.
[4027.82 → 4029.74] So there's a fair, like, Arch is...
[4029.74 → 4030.22] Oh, Manjaro.
[4030.34 → 4030.52] Sorry.
[4031.12 → 4031.40] Manjaro.
[4031.40 → 4032.22] Madero is the crypto.
[4032.22 → 4038.92] And now fairly, it's kind of upstream of a lot of distributions that are gaining in popularity as well.
[4039.30 → 4043.28] So I use Arch, by the way, is now going to be a lot more common for a lot more people.
[4043.60 → 4047.16] That's what every guy is saying when he shows off his sweet Steam deck.
[4047.26 → 4049.58] He's like, yo, girl, I use Arch, by the way.
[4049.58 → 4049.94] I don't understand Linux, you Linux people.
[4050.10 → 4050.94] Yo, girl.
[4052.48 → 4053.74] Girl, can I get your GitHub?
[4054.96 → 4056.26] Girl, give me your GitHub.
[4056.64 → 4056.90] All right.
[4056.90 → 4060.10] And then one last obvious thing that we need to kind of point out right here.
[4060.10 → 4070.68] Now, this may not perfectly and accurately represent the totals yet, but today we are sitting at $2,470 worth of subs.
[4072.08 → 4072.56] Wow.
[4073.56 → 4076.96] So all of those subs are going to, of course, go straight to Neovim.
[4077.08 → 4079.12] So I don't know where that's going to end at.
[4079.22 → 4083.08] It might, you know, sometimes it takes a little bit of processing and all that, and then it'll end somewhere in there.
[4083.72 → 4084.46] Very nice.
[4084.56 → 4084.68] Yeah.
[4085.04 → 4087.62] Would it be fair to say that Neovim is the future of Vim?
[4089.28 → 4089.64] Dang.
[4090.10 → 4091.24] Is that a good tagline?
[4092.26 → 4093.70] Neovim, the future of Vim.
[4094.44 → 4095.02] I like it.
[4095.10 → 4096.30] That's how I classify it.
[4096.32 → 4102.92] It sounds super cool, but I know I have a very strong feeling that there are a few people right now already getting a tweet ready.
[4103.38 → 4103.62] Okay.
[4104.18 → 4104.82] Sorry, sorry.
[4104.88 → 4107.88] They're already getting a Mastodon post ready to kind of discredit you right now.
[4108.72 → 4110.22] Is Mastodon still a thing?
[4111.42 → 4111.82] Yes.
[4112.26 → 4116.76] Mastodon is both still a thing, and it is still the thing people go to say mean things on.
[4117.04 → 4117.40] Yeah.
[4118.16 → 4118.52] Crazy.
[4118.52 → 4119.64] But not as bad as Blue Sky.
[4120.42 → 4120.66] Yeah.
[4120.92 → 4122.28] I forgot that existed too.
[4123.32 → 4124.06] So did most people.
[4124.06 → 4124.38] That's all right.
[4125.16 → 4125.52] Yeah.
[4125.52 → 4134.44] I wanted to just remind everybody that, you know, in the audience, shout out to Planet Scale for this idea.
[4134.50 → 4134.66] Yeah.
[4134.86 → 4137.22] Sam came to us with the idea and threw it out.
[4137.28 → 4140.08] So hopefully this was fun for everybody, and we got to highlight some fun projects.
[4140.20 → 4142.50] I just want to at least throw that out one more time for sure.
[4142.50 → 4144.36] Can we in earnest plug that?
[4144.46 → 4146.00] Because I literally have a question right now.
[4146.08 → 4147.70] What does Planet Scale do, Teen?
[4148.04 → 4148.88] Great question.
[4149.34 → 4157.00] Planet Scale is your all-in-one solution for hosting, sharding, and having high performance MySQL and Postgres databases anywhere in the world.
[4157.00 → 4158.36] You want it to work well.
[4158.44 → 4159.18] You want it to run fast.
[4159.24 → 4160.36] You want it to be high uptime.
[4160.54 → 4161.16] Choose Planet Scale.
[4161.70 → 4164.78] And so they run databases specifically or anything you want?
[4165.60 → 4167.74] They just do database hosting stuff.
[4167.86 → 4167.92] Okay.
[4168.06 → 4170.26] So if you've got databases, they will database you.
[4170.26 → 4174.74] And they're very, like, focused on just that problem.
[4174.86 → 4176.56] So they have, like, a few different options.
[4176.56 → 4179.26] They have some cool, like, sharding and replication stuff.
[4179.50 → 4183.64] They have cool ways to get very high performance, like, replication all across.
[4183.86 → 4188.48] And they have stuff to basically run it on, like, I think they call it bare metal or something.
[4188.60 → 4195.22] It's a little bit, like, I think, Casey, you might be like, it doesn't sound exactly like bare metal, but it's like bare metal for the database world.
[4195.78 → 4199.18] So they have a lot of, like, very nice offerings for that.
[4199.18 → 4199.88] So there you go.
[4199.92 → 4201.06] That's Planet Scale.
[4201.40 → 4201.82] All right.
[4202.54 → 4202.82] Mm-hmm.
[4203.48 → 4205.68] And they have a cool website, I think, too, which is nice.
[4207.32 → 4208.46] Like, I think it looks cool.
[4209.40 → 4209.88] So there you go.
[4209.92 → 4210.50] There's that, too.
[4210.94 → 4211.42] I was like, okay.
[4211.84 → 4215.20] You are sitting in front of a giant block of green right now, Teen.
[4215.28 → 4215.52] So.
[4215.88 → 4216.10] Yeah.
[4216.18 → 4216.34] Yeah.
[4216.42 → 4216.96] Yeah, right.
[4217.04 → 4219.14] Well, yeah, my style is obviously good.
[4219.38 → 4221.10] You can trust me.
[4221.44 → 4221.72] Yeah.
[4221.82 → 4222.12] You can trust me.
[4222.12 → 4222.24] Yeah.
[4222.46 → 4225.46] It's like, I know what a stylish website looks like.
[4225.46 → 4226.08] Believe you me.
[4226.08 → 4227.32] You guys think I don't know style?
[4227.68 → 4228.88] Have you seen these?
[4228.88 → 4229.32] Yeah.
[4230.32 → 4230.72] Yes.
[4231.22 → 4233.76] I can't believe Teen just threw his feet on stream like that.
[4234.26 → 4234.42] Oh.
[4234.94 → 4235.34] Barefoot.
[4235.60 → 4236.24] I know.
[4236.90 → 4238.20] Clip it and ship it, boys.
[4238.38 → 4241.34] The subscriptions are about to skyrocket on this channel.
[4243.04 → 4244.08] It tells you for free.
[4244.32 → 4245.66] Prime, I'm not even kidding.
[4245.78 → 4252.26] I think the very first thing I saw before I knew you at all, the very first thing I saw
[4252.26 → 4257.82] from your stream was literally you sticking your foot in the camera going, look at that
[4257.82 → 4258.60] separation.
[4259.88 → 4260.98] That's what I saw.
[4261.14 → 4261.58] It's true.
[4261.86 → 4262.36] Dude, look at that.
[4262.36 → 4264.68] I was like, all right, this guy clearly is good.
[4264.68 → 4266.00] I am like totally.
[4266.00 → 4266.06] I am like totally.
[4266.06 → 4266.12] I am like totally.
[4266.12 → 4266.66] Ew.
[4266.66 → 4268.02] I get screwed.
[4269.02 → 4269.90] It's not that bad.
[4269.90 → 4271.28] My wife used to let me spoon her.
[4271.38 → 4273.82] She no longer likes it because she's like, I like to sleep.
[4273.96 → 4274.40] You know, anyway.
[4275.60 → 4280.96] Sometimes, you know, the back of her heel, I would take the separation and break the back
[4280.96 → 4282.30] of her heel with my dog.
[4282.68 → 4283.98] That's so gross.
[4283.98 → 4287.30] You definitely did not get permission to tell that story.
[4287.48 → 4287.68] There is no way.
[4287.68 → 4289.28] That is disgusting.
[4289.84 → 4290.88] I can like to feel it.
[4291.12 → 4291.50] I know.
[4291.88 → 4293.68] I can grab it in my little precedes.
[4294.06 → 4295.06] TMI stream.
[4295.98 → 4301.82] You just, that $2,400 of donations is going to be revoked immediately.
[4301.82 → 4302.28] Thanks to Planet Scale.
[4302.28 → 4304.28] Everyone is coming in and unsubscribing.
[4304.50 → 4305.26] Thank you, Planet Scale.
[4305.54 → 4306.16] Right now.
[4306.16 → 4307.52] Let me see how far I can spread my toes.
[4308.04 → 4308.72] Oh my God.
[4308.72 → 4310.10] I can't even spread my toe.
[4310.86 → 4311.16] Yeah.
[4312.60 → 4313.30] Oh, this has gone so far off.
[4313.30 → 4314.26] Wait, how'd you do it?
[4314.58 → 4316.00] This has gone so far off the rails.
[4316.02 → 4318.16] It's not that I look like, look, this is me relaxed.
[4319.86 → 4320.18] What?
[4320.52 → 4321.10] Yeah, yeah.
[4321.12 → 4322.10] It's like a gun sight.
[4322.50 → 4324.00] I can like to look right through it.
[4324.48 → 4325.60] I'm looking right through it.
[4325.62 → 4326.40] I'm looking right at it.
[4326.54 → 4327.68] That's me relaxed.
[4328.16 → 4329.18] Oh my God.
[4329.62 → 4329.86] Yeah.
[4331.16 → 4333.14] That's your ADT aim down toe.
[4333.58 → 4333.74] Yeah.
[4334.42 → 4335.14] Can't do it.
[4335.94 → 4337.98] Right mouse click to aim down toes.
[4338.38 → 4338.58] That's crazy.
[4338.58 → 4340.76] And that was completely relaxed.
[4340.90 → 4343.16] So I wasn't like trying to open them up.
[4343.90 → 4344.56] Oh no.
[4344.78 → 4347.46] So you've been getting like some nasty stuff in between there, huh?
[4347.78 → 4349.06] No, it's nice and open.
[4349.78 → 4351.84] It's so big, nothing could get stuck there.
[4351.86 → 4352.54] Oh, that's true.
[4352.64 → 4353.08] Fair enough.
[4353.08 → 4354.40] It's when you have no space.
[4354.56 → 4355.08] That's when the nasty things happen.
[4355.08 → 4355.26] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4355.26 → 4355.98] You're right, you're right, you're right.
[4355.98 → 4356.28] You're right, you're right.
[4356.56 → 4357.64] Stuff rubbing together, okay?
[4357.76 → 4358.56] Trash, be honest.
[4358.62 → 4360.34] How often are you cleaning between your toes?
[4360.84 → 4361.14] Yeah, Trash.
[4361.14 → 4363.92] Every time I'm in the shower, which is every day, okay?
[4364.48 → 4364.84] Yeah, right.
[4364.98 → 4365.86] There's no way I believe that.
[4365.86 → 4366.94] I shower every day.
[4367.52 → 4370.06] No, I believe that you shower every day.
[4370.12 → 4370.28] Yeah.
[4370.42 → 4373.12] Oh, you're talking about how I clean my toes actively?
[4373.28 → 4373.44] Yeah.
[4374.18 → 4375.10] Yeah, I don't know about that.
[4375.60 → 4375.98] I don't know.
[4375.98 → 4380.34] Yeah, he is lying.
[4381.10 → 4383.68] Nothing exists below my waist as far as I'm concerned.
[4383.68 → 4384.54] Oh, that's right.
[4385.98 → 4387.00] I'm just kidding.
[4387.48 → 4388.80] I'm cleaning up down to my ankles.
[4388.86 → 4391.24] I'm not flexible, so it's hard for me to grab my toes.
[4391.86 → 4394.62] Wait, how do you do fancy jujitsu things with no flexibility?
[4395.14 → 4395.90] It's hard.
[4396.26 → 4396.46] Okay.
[4396.46 → 4397.26] It's hard, you know?
[4397.32 → 4397.86] It's hard.
[4398.22 → 4399.98] Hey, TJ, did you know this?
[4400.22 → 4400.76] Fun fact.
[4400.76 → 4400.92] What?
[4401.32 → 4405.12] Planet Scale's only designer, Jason Long, designed the Neovim logo.
[4405.98 → 4406.58] Oh.
[4407.04 → 4407.48] What?
[4408.24 → 4408.54] Yeah.
[4408.74 → 4410.28] Where did you just find that out?
[4410.60 → 4413.12] Sam, CEO of Planet Scale.
[4413.52 → 4415.48] Sam, that's crazy lore.
[4415.68 → 4416.48] What the heck?
[4416.66 → 4418.32] That is actually insane lore.
[4418.90 → 4420.48] Just dropping lore like that?
[4421.40 → 4423.02] All the money's actually going to Planet Scale.
[4423.62 → 4423.92] Thank you.
[4423.92 → 4425.16] It all goes back to Planet Scale.
[4426.74 → 4428.50] All roads lead back to Planet Scale.
[4428.50 → 4429.84] All roads lead to Planet Scale.
[4430.06 → 4431.32] Wait a second.
[4431.82 → 4433.28] It's like, dude, it's crazy.
[4433.78 → 4434.42] It's the AI.
[4434.42 → 4440.94] It's the AI bubble trade diagram, but it's all the open source projects we just gave to.
[4441.62 → 4443.90] They all funnel back to this one designer.
[4444.86 → 4445.82] Oh, my gosh.
[4445.82 → 4446.54] That's so funny.
[4447.38 → 4447.68] Wow.
[4447.76 → 4447.90] Cool.
[4448.56 → 4448.74] Nice.
[4448.74 → 4449.44] That's actually crazy.
[4449.68 → 4452.16] I'm going to have to follow up with Sam about that after this.
[4452.72 → 4456.60] By the way, Janus did a nice job and got a nice image of me.
[4457.02 → 4457.38] Yeah.
[4457.88 → 4458.44] Nice.
[4458.44 → 4459.10] There it is.
[4459.60 → 4460.18] Look at that.
[4460.20 → 4460.72] Right there.
[4461.06 → 4462.60] Do you scrub the bottom of your feet?
[4463.08 → 4464.44] Like with a rock or whatever?
[4465.32 → 4465.56] No.
[4465.66 → 4465.82] No?
[4465.92 → 4466.56] With a rock?
[4466.88 → 4467.74] You mean a pumice?
[4468.20 → 4468.82] Is that what it's called?
[4468.92 → 4469.02] A pumice?
[4469.02 → 4470.10] Are you referring to a pumice?
[4470.90 → 4471.26] Maybe.
[4471.26 → 4472.28] I don't know what a pumice is.
[4472.74 → 4474.60] I'm afraid to ask what it means.
[4474.60 → 4478.22] It's a little like, it's a porous like rock thing you use to exfoliate.
[4478.22 → 4478.30] Exfoliate.
[4478.96 → 4480.62] I'm pretty sure you're trying to say pumice.
[4481.58 → 4484.12] Well, you know, tomato, tomato, fry.
[4485.06 → 4486.44] It's pronounced hummus.
[4487.08 → 4487.44] You know.
[4487.98 → 4488.38] Yeah.
[4489.14 → 4489.48] All right.
[4489.58 → 4491.80] You know, why be pedantic about it?
