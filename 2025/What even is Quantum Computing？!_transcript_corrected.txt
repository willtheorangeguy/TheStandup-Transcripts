[0.00 → 0.50] Trash.
[0.50 → 1.00] Trash.
[1.00 → 3.00] Nope, I have something more important.
[3.00 → 4.00] Oooooohhh.
[4.00 → 5.00] Did you try it?
[5.00 → 7.00] Trash, you were so right, dude.
[7.00 → 8.00] Banger, bro!
[8.00 → 9.00] Absolute bang!
[9.00 → 11.00] My favourites are the red and the pink.
[11.00 → 12.00] Red!
[12.00 → 13.00] Oh!
[13.00 → 17.00] Obviously, you should listen to Trash when it comes to snacks.
[17.00 → 20.00] Like, the first time I ate it, like, I ate a red one, and my eyes, like, rolled to the back of my head.
[20.00 → 22.00] I was like, I can't believe...
[22.00 → 25.00] I'm sorry, what were the name of those treats?
[25.00 → 27.00] I thought it was a dog treat.
[27.00 → 28.00] Dog treats!
[28.00 → 29.00] I was thinking they were dog treats!
[29.00 → 30.00] Yeah, it says Chewie on it.
[30.00 → 31.00] They kinda, they kinda come in a bag.
[31.00 → 33.00] That's a dog brand, isn't it?
[33.00 → 34.00] It is.
[34.00 → 35.00] This is...
[35.00 → 36.00] This is...
[36.00 → 37.00] Chewie's.
[37.00 → 38.00] Chewie's.
[38.00 → 40.00] Yeah, but Chewie.com is a dog food site.
[40.00 → 41.00] Yeah, yeah.
[41.00 → 42.00] You're right about that.
[42.00 → 43.00] It's like the subscription thing.
[43.00 → 44.00] Yeah.
[44.00 → 45.00] It does say allergy friendly.
[45.00 → 48.00] The more I read the packaging, I'm wondering, Trash, have I been eating dog treats for the past day?
[48.00 → 49.00] They're delicious!
[49.00 → 50.00] MAYA!
[50.00 → 51.00] MAYA!
[51.00 → 52.00] YAY AYA!
[52.00 → 53.00] MAYA!
[53.00 → 54.00] MAYA!
[54.00 → 55.00] Anyway, sorry.
[55.00 → 56.00] Alright.
[56.00 → 57.00] Welcome to the stand-up.
[57.00 → 63.00] Today we have with us Ginger Bill, an actual quantum physicist, Siege and Trash Dev.
[63.00 → 71.00] And we're going to be talking about things quantum AI, because you know, I don't know about you guys, but every single week I see some breakthrough quantum computers going to be absolutely amazing.
[71.00 → 78.00] And this week Google released a paper showing that it's able to do verifiable quantum algorithms getting reproducible results through.
[78.00 → 84.00] And it's finally time AI supremacy or quantum supremacy, maybe quantum AI supremacy is going to happen.
[84.00 → 85.00] It's from Google quantum AI.
[85.00 → 86.00] It's going to happen.
[86.00 → 87.00] We're going to see it.
[87.00 → 96.00] And since none of us are smart enough except for Ginger Bill to actually understand what's happening, we thought we would discuss this and bring on a real semi-expert.
[96.00 → 99.00] Quasi-expert.
[99.00 → 101.00] I know we're talking about semi-trucks.
[101.00 → 110.00] To lay the foundation, this week Google released a paper along with a marketing video showing that they've created something called quantum echoes.
[110.00 → 120.00] Effectively a way for them to be able to take some sort of chip with 105 quits on it, do some sort of perturbation is what they call it, make it vibrate, and then run the algorithm in reverse and boom,
[120.00 → 127.00] they're sucking out answers with pretty high reproducibility and able to actually predict structures of molecules and all that.
[127.00 → 129.00] Now for us, what does that actually mean?
[129.00 → 131.00] Is there any actual practical implication?
[131.00 → 135.00] Is 21 still the largest factored number by quantum machinery?
[135.00 → 136.00] We will find out.
[136.00 → 138.00] All right, Ginger Bill.
[138.00 → 143.00] Since all of us are actual online idiots, can you just please give us like the-
[143.00 → 144.00] Professional online idiots.
[144.00 → 145.00] Professional.
[145.00 → 146.00] You, sir.
[146.00 → 147.00] Sorry, I'm paid.
[147.00 → 148.00] I'm paid.
[148.00 → 149.00] So I'm not an amateur like-
[149.00 → 150.00] Wait, professional.
[150.00 → 151.00] It's fine.
[151.00 → 152.00] I'm a professional here.
[152.00 → 153.00] I made a couple dollars.
[153.00 → 154.00] That's good.
[154.00 → 156.00] You made a couple dollars, deleted a couple posts, not a big deal.
[156.00 → 157.00] Oh no.
[157.00 → 158.00] Oh no.
[158.00 → 159.00] Oh no.
[159.00 → 160.00] Oh no.
[160.00 → 166.00] Could you please give us like the high level of quantum computers, what this actually means,
[166.00 → 173.00] like something to kind of help us as idiots understand all these sensational articles we see constantly.
[173.00 → 174.00] Right.
[174.00 → 179.00] I'm going to try my best here to explain any of this.
[179.00 → 180.00] Okay.
[180.00 → 186.00] So most people, if you've ever, if you, okay, I'm assuming the audience here knows at least the basics of computers, right?
[186.00 → 188.00] They probably know quantum slip test as well.
[188.00 → 189.00] The double, whatever.
[189.00 → 190.00] Yeah.
[190.00 → 191.00] So I'm going to ignore all that.
[191.00 → 194.00] I'm going to go even simpler first, just to break it down.
[194.00 → 195.00] You've got classical computers, right?
[195.00 → 196.00] Let's call it classical, right?
[196.00 → 198.00] This is where you've got, let's say, binary computers.
[198.00 → 199.00] Mozart, Beethoven.
[199.00 → 200.00] Yeah.
[200.00 → 201.00] Yeah.
[201.00 → 204.00] All those stuff like Bach and me, but yes.
[204.00 → 207.00] Do like a sonata and see mine.
[207.00 → 208.00] Oh.
[208.00 → 209.00] Now we're going from there.
[209.00 → 212.00] Classical computers, even like we've got binary things.
[212.00 → 215.00] You've got like ones and zeros over there, where we call these bits, right?
[215.00 → 217.00] A bit, it can store two states, either zero or one.
[217.00 → 222.00] If you've got two bits, you can store four states, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, and one, zero.
[222.00 → 223.00] Right?
[223.00 → 226.00] I don't know why I didn't have that order, but that's, there's, you can see what it gets.
[226.00 → 229.00] And you get to three bits, you get eight, and you can see how many different states you get.
[229.00 → 233.00] Now the thing is, in classical computers, when you've got something with that many bits,
[233.00 → 236.00] it's either in one of the one of the states only, right?
[236.00 → 239.00] If there are three bits, it can be only one of the eight.
[239.00 → 240.00] That's it.
[240.00 → 241.00] Did you find the errors?
[241.00 → 243.00] I don't even know what they look.
[243.00 → 244.00] What do they even look like?
[244.00 → 245.00] They're in the phone.
[245.00 → 247.00] In the phone?
[247.00 → 249.00] Yeah, they're definitely in there.
[249.00 → 251.00] I just don't know how we labelled them.
[251.00 → 252.00] I got it, don't worry.
[252.00 → 254.00] You have to figure it out.
[254.00 → 256.00] We're running out of time, Prime.
[256.00 → 259.00] You have to find them and meet me at the standup.
[259.00 → 260.00] Roger.
[260.00 → 264.00] They're in the phone.
[264.00 → 266.00] It's so simple.
[266.00 → 272.00] Get all the context you need to debug your problem, because code breaks.
[272.00 → 275.00] So fix it faster with Sentry.
[275.00 → 276.00] Right.
[276.00 → 284.00] That's the simple bit about, and then basic classical computers.
[284.00 → 285.00] You've got bits.
[285.00 → 288.00] Now when you get to quantum mechanics, they have something fancier.
[288.00 → 291.00] They like calling them quits or quantum bits.
[291.00 → 305.00] And what they do here, as I'm going to say a fancy word, which isn't actually that fancy at all when you actually understand it, is they say quit is a something that is a superposition of both the zero value and the one value.
[305.00 → 310.00] Now the word superposition really confuses most people because it's just sounds silly.
[310.00 → 313.00] But most people probably understand what it is.
[313.00 → 316.00] The one you always like the textbook when you learn in physics is like waves.
[316.00 → 317.00] Right.
[317.00 → 321.00] If you can think of, imagine it's an extremely still pond.
[321.00 → 322.00] Right.
[322.00 → 326.00] And you drop like two stones at different parts of the pond, they'll produce ripples.
[326.00 → 327.00] Right.
[327.00 → 330.00] When the ripples come to interact with each other.
[330.00 → 331.00] Right.
[331.00 → 333.00] You've got two sets of waves coming to interact.
[333.00 → 338.00] How those waves interact with each other, add together to make one new wave.
[338.00 → 340.00] That's called a superposition of two different waves.
[340.00 → 341.00] That's it.
[341.00 → 342.00] That's what it means.
[342.00 → 345.00] You've added, literally they've come together and that's the superposition.
[345.00 → 356.00] Now the more abstract thing is when you're talking about these quit things, is that they are now superpositions of the zero and a one state or whatever they correlate to.
[356.00 → 366.00] So in this case, it's a little bit more like, hey, this thing, this quit, it's like, let's say there's a 40% chance it's in the 0% state and a 60% chance it's in the one state.
[366.00 → 367.00] Right.
[367.00 → 370.00] But that's its, like, state currently.
[370.00 → 371.00] That's the state of that quit.
[371.00 → 375.00] I'm going to make it completely static here as well, not to confuse anyone further.
[375.00 → 380.00] So you've got a basic, basic idea of what a quit is.
[380.00 → 383.00] Now the funny bit is when you have two quits.
[383.00 → 384.00] Right.
[384.00 → 385.00] Let's make it a little bit more fancy.
[385.00 → 393.00] Again, we, before we had two bits, we have these four possible states, but when you have two quits, you want to usually want to entangle them together.
[393.00 → 397.00] Now this word entanglement is like links.
[397.00 → 399.00] You can't pull them apart.
[399.00 → 400.00] Yeah.
[400.00 → 401.00] Okay.
[401.00 → 402.00] Hold on.
[402.00 → 403.00] I need to know.
[403.00 → 404.00] Is TJ correct?
[404.00 → 406.00] Is it entanglement like the Avengers?
[406.00 → 408.00] Uh, I actually haven't watched the Avengers.
[408.00 → 410.00] Neither the spy one nor the superheroes.
[410.00 → 412.00] What about like blind entanglements?
[412.00 → 415.00] Like what kind of entanglements are we talking about here?
[415.00 → 418.00] Is interstellar a documentary?
[418.00 → 421.00] Sorry to tell you, TJ.
[421.00 → 423.00] It's, it's a film by Christopher Nolan.
[423.00 → 426.00] That's my, he makes my favourite documentaries.
[426.00 → 427.00] I know.
[427.00 → 428.00] They're really sometimes cool.
[428.00 → 429.00] I like Tenet.
[429.00 → 430.00] That's a perfect documentary, right?
[433.00 → 434.00] Sorry.
[434.00 → 435.00] Sorry, Minersville.
[435.00 → 436.00] You can continue.
[436.00 → 437.00] Okay.
[437.00 → 439.00] You can't just drop the entanglement word without us sounding like idiots.
[439.00 → 440.00] Again, you got a professional.
[440.00 → 447.00] No, no, but the word entanglement, it just means that these two, like two states are intrinsically linked, and you can't, they're not separable is a better way of putting it.
[447.00 → 448.00] Right?
[448.00 → 449.00] No, it's not.
[449.00 → 451.00] I don't know what that actually means, but okay.
[451.00 → 452.00] There's just two things together.
[452.00 → 457.00] And yeah, like they, like it is, this is the weird bit about quantum mechanics is the entanglement bit, right?
[457.00 → 460.00] Superposition bit is not actually the weird bit.
[460.00 → 461.00] Yeah.
[461.00 → 463.00] That even happens in classical.
[463.00 → 465.00] If you want to be like classical waves, right?
[465.00 → 466.00] They can be superposition.
[466.00 → 467.00] Right.
[467.00 → 468.00] If we drop the two things in the lake, it makes sense.
[468.00 → 470.00] The entangle bit is literally, they just are like joined together.
[470.00 → 471.00] You cannot separate them.
[471.00 → 475.00] There's no math model operation that can separate those two states.
[475.00 → 477.00] They're just now intrinsically linked.
[477.00 → 481.00] So what scientists have joined, let no man separate is what you're trying to say?
[481.00 → 482.00] Is that the rule?
[482.00 → 483.00] Yes.
[483.00 → 484.00] Okay.
[484.00 → 485.00] Bang.
[485.00 → 486.00] Bang.
[486.00 → 487.00] There's a caveat there.
[487.00 → 490.00] I'm trying to dumb this down as much as I can, but it doesn't matter.
[490.00 → 491.00] Right.
[491.00 → 492.00] There's a reason.
[492.00 → 493.00] Right.
[493.00 → 494.00] So we've got this entanglement, right?
[494.00 → 495.00] We've got two of them entangled.
[495.00 → 509.00] Now, of this state, before we've had two bits, you'd have like the 001001 and 11 state, right?
[509.00 → 516.00] Now together with those quits, you're actually representing all four of those states at once with certain probabilities.
[516.00 → 526.00] So there's like, let's say 20% chance it's in state A, 10% chance it's state B, 30% chance it's in state C, and 40% chance it's in state D.
[526.00 → 527.00] I had to add that up in my head.
[527.00 → 528.00] Yeah.
[528.00 → 533.00] Like, they're kind of the probabilities it could be in that particular state, right?
[533.00 → 537.00] So now you've got all of them computing, like all stored at once.
[537.00 → 545.00] Now, when you add more and more quits and things, you get more and more of these different states that are all being represented at once.
[545.00 → 546.00] Mm-hmm.
[546.00 → 550.00] So I think like the latest computer, like common computers, like it's over 600 quits or something.
[550.00 → 551.00] It's probably more than that now.
[551.00 → 552.00] I don't know.
[552.00 → 555.00] It's a big number in the computing world.
[555.00 → 559.00] Because it's two to whatever that number is, is how many states there are, right?
[559.00 → 560.00] That's like more as in the universe.
[560.00 → 561.00] Yes, it's two to that, yeah.
[561.00 → 564.00] Why would you need a so just help me understand even like a stupid question.
[564.00 → 574.00] Why would I need something bigger than like 64 quits or maybe 128 quits, considering it literally represents the probability of all values at any given moment?
[574.00 → 576.00] Because that's the only bits they've got.
[576.00 → 580.00] Like in your computer right now, you've probably got like 64 gigabytes of RAM, right?
[580.00 → 581.00] That's a lot of bits.
[581.00 → 582.00] That's a lot of bits.
[582.00 → 583.00] That's a lot of bits.
[583.00 → 585.00] Yeah, that's all they have memory-wise.
[585.00 → 586.00] That's all the bits.
[586.00 → 588.00] Yeah, but, okay.
[588.00 → 589.00] Yeah.
[589.00 → 591.00] But we only operate on, like a CPU theoretically only.
[591.00 → 592.00] So yes, they can store a lot of states.
[592.00 → 596.00] In fact, they cannot just store two to the N, they do two to the two to the N.
[596.00 → 597.00] So it's huge.
[597.00 → 602.00] So 300 quits is effectively equivalent to be, what, more than atoms in the universe.
[602.00 → 603.00] Yeah.
[603.00 → 604.00] Right.
[604.00 → 605.00] If I remember correctly.
[605.00 → 610.00] Okay, so, but like CPUs process like a set, like one operation at a time.
[610.00 → 611.00] Yeah.
[611.00 → 612.00] Yeah.
[612.00 → 614.00] Where these things are like, I don't know, meaning.
[614.00 → 617.00] Well, they're still doing one operation at a time.
[617.00 → 618.00] Okay.
[618.00 → 622.00] But the thing is because of their probability distribution thing going on here, right?
[622.00 → 627.00] It's kind of like it's doing it all probabilistically distributed across all the possible states.
[627.00 → 628.00] Okay.
[628.00 → 631.00] So it can do multiple, quote unquote, multiple things at once.
[631.00 → 635.00] Now for most problems, this is where like most people may not understand.
[635.00 → 638.00] Quantum computing has got some only certain cases where it's useful.
[638.00 → 642.00] Most of the time classical, as we know at the moment, is better for virtually everything else.
[642.00 → 645.00] Certain things are better with the quantum algorithms.
[645.00 → 649.00] So the most common one that most probably have heard of is Show's algorithm.
[649.00 → 659.00] This is the one where you can decompose an integer into its prime components, right?
[659.00 → 660.00] What do I have to do with that?
[660.00 → 663.00] And this can be done in polynomial time.
[663.00 → 664.00] Sorry.
[664.00 → 665.00] Prime components, Ginger Bill.
[665.00 → 666.00] Keep up.
[666.00 → 667.00] The prime components.
[667.00 → 668.00] The prime again.
[668.00 → 669.00] Yeah.
[669.00 → 670.00] All right.
[670.00 → 671.00] Sorry.
[671.00 → 672.00] Keep going.
[672.00 → 673.00] Sorry.
[673.00 → 674.00] I'm trying to think as well.
[674.00 → 679.00] Jokes are really hard to do when you're trying to actually think.
[679.00 → 682.00] Again, you're dealing with some professionals right now, okay?
[682.00 → 683.00] I'm not listening.
[683.00 → 685.00] I'm just trying to come up with jokes.
[685.00 → 686.00] All right.
[686.00 → 691.00] I had a joke about web browsers, and we went right past it.
[691.00 → 692.00] All right, hold on, TJ.
[692.00 → 693.00] Let your web browser joke go.
[693.00 → 695.00] Can I say it now since we're paused?
[695.00 → 698.00] I was going to say Ginger Bill said classical computers are better at web browsers.
[698.00 → 704.00] So I was wondering if that's kind of like Ginger Bill currently co-signing on the state of the web.
[706.00 → 707.00] Let's see.
[707.00 → 708.00] I'm putting the rubber stamp on it.
[708.00 → 709.00] Great.
[709.00 → 710.00] Yeah, there we go.
[710.00 → 711.00] Looks good to me.
[711.00 → 712.00] Looks good.
[712.00 → 713.00] Looks fine to me.
[713.00 → 714.00] Yeah.
[714.00 → 715.00] I'll just merge it.
[715.00 → 716.00] It doesn't matter.
[716.00 → 717.00] It doesn't matter if we'll pass the tests.
[717.00 → 718.00] We'll fix it later.
[718.00 → 719.00] I never do.
[719.00 → 721.00] No, but yeah.
[721.00 → 722.00] So that's kind of the thing.
[722.00 → 726.00] So then there's the last component when it comes to component computing, if I can think
[726.00 → 735.00] of which is effectively interference and decoherence, which I'm going to merge together just to keep it simple, which is not correct, but whatever.
[738.00 → 743.00] Interference, you have to understand is that these quantum systems, if you've ever seen a quantum computer, they have to be really, freezing.
[743.00 → 747.00] Like they're literally like fractions of a degree above absolute zero most of the time.
[747.00 → 752.00] And the reason why you want to get them cold is you don't want any background noise interfering with it.
[753.00 → 756.00] Because if you have background noise, it will make it noisy.
[756.00 → 762.00] And again, when these systems, again, they're not discrete like your computer, they're probabilistic effectively.
[762.00 → 770.00] And if you add more noise to it, your result gets more noisy and noisier until you've got absolute noise at the end of the day.
[770.00 → 771.00] It's useless.
[772.00 → 774.00] So sometimes you'll have interference from these different probabilities.
[774.00 → 779.00] Like sometimes the probabilities will amplify each other or cancel each other out as well.
[779.00 → 783.00] If there's even no background noise, that's another form of interference, which can be useful for certain algorithms.
[783.00 → 788.00] Like again, if you have two waves on an ocean or a thing, if they're in sync, they'll get amplitude.
[788.00 → 792.00] If they're out of phase, they'll cancel each other out.
[792.00 → 794.00] And then the last one is decoherence, which is...
[794.00 → 796.00] Trash talking.
[797.00 → 798.00] Yeah.
[798.00 → 802.00] No, decoherence is the other one where you would...
[802.00 → 806.00] I'd say it's collapsing a quantum state into a classical state, right?
[806.00 → 808.00] Which is where you want to read it.
[808.00 → 810.00] You want to be able to read something in a classical state.
[810.00 → 811.00] Is it in this state or another?
[811.00 → 813.00] Can you explain it in terms of monads?
[813.00 → 814.00] Because this feels a little confusing.
[814.00 → 815.00] Is this like a lift?
[815.00 → 817.00] Yeah, I dumb it down to monads.
[817.00 → 818.00] Monads.
[818.00 → 820.00] Oh God, whatever the joke is, the endofunctus.
[820.00 → 821.00] I can't remember the flipping joke.
[821.00 → 827.00] Look, Prime, they could be anywhere in the burrito until you open it up and look inside.
[827.00 → 829.00] And then they're only in one spot in the burrito.
[829.00 → 831.00] And how many times you close the burrito and look inside again?
[831.00 → 832.00] Pretty much.
[832.00 → 833.00] They're in the same spot.
[833.00 → 834.00] Got it.
[834.00 → 835.00] That's actually right.
[835.00 → 836.00] I understand it.
[836.00 → 837.00] Okay.
[837.00 → 838.00] Right?
[838.00 → 839.00] Yeah.
[839.00 → 840.00] Kind of.
[840.00 → 841.00] I'm not a good man.
[841.00 → 843.00] Well, yeah, monads aren't really burritos either, Ginger Bill.
[843.00 → 844.00] Okay?
[844.00 → 845.00] They're a computer construct.
[845.00 → 846.00] All right?
[846.00 → 847.00] They're not actually a burrito.
[847.00 → 848.00] All right?
[848.00 → 850.00] I know there's no burritos in my machine, Ginger Bill.
[850.00 → 851.00] There's not really burritos in there, dude.
[851.00 → 854.00] Who's the professional idiot now, Ginger Bill?
[854.00 → 856.00] Is this why you like procedural programming?
[856.00 → 859.00] How else you cook a burrito other than on a GPU when it's red-hot?
[859.00 → 860.00] Come on.
[860.00 → 863.00] You could maybe cook one on there.
[863.00 → 864.00] Okay, I'll give you that one.
[864.00 → 865.00] I'll give you that.
[865.00 → 866.00] See?
[866.00 → 867.00] And it's a good place to keep them warm.
[867.00 → 868.00] It's a nice little warm room.
[868.00 → 869.00] There we go.
[869.00 → 870.00] I don't see the problem.
[870.00 → 871.00] Mm-hmm.
[871.00 → 872.00] All right.
[872.00 → 873.00] All right.
[873.00 → 874.00] All right.
[874.00 → 875.00] All right.
[875.00 → 876.00] I have a quick question.
[876.00 → 877.00] I'm probably going to sidetrack this.
[877.00 → 878.00] That's great.
[878.00 → 881.00] We're not sidetracked right now, so I'm very upset that you're doing this.
[881.00 → 885.00] From everything you've explained, it just sounds like it's so fragile.
[885.00 → 886.00] Yes.
[886.00 → 888.00] Who does?
[888.00 → 893.00] Are they burying these things underground, so there's just no noise?
[893.00 → 894.00] No.
[894.00 → 899.00] To be very careful here, people who don't know, my specialty was not quantum computing.
[899.00 → 903.00] When I used to do it, it was quantum optics, which is still heavily related to this, by
[903.00 → 904.00] the way.
[904.00 → 907.00] Luckily, I can flag it enough, so I'm okay.
[907.00 → 908.00] I assume it's 50% related.
[908.00 → 910.00] What they do is they don't necessarily put it underground.
[910.00 → 914.00] When you make things very cold in that sense, what you're doing is, depending on which system
[914.00 → 918.00] you're in, if you'll say you're trapping, let's say an atom, let's just say you're trapping
[918.00 → 922.00] an atom, what you're doing is, temperature at the end of the day is you're reducing the
[922.00 → 924.00] wiggliness of something.
[924.00 → 925.00] Right?
[925.00 → 926.00] Temperature is wiggliness.
[926.00 → 927.00] Technical term.
[927.00 → 928.00] No jiggle.
[928.00 → 929.00] No jiggle.
[929.00 → 930.00] No jiggle.
[930.00 → 933.00] So just imagine when you're cooling down an atom, right?
[933.00 → 937.00] Imagine it's an elephant, and you're shooting ping pong balls at it, right?
[937.00 → 941.00] If you shoot ping pong balls from every single direction, eventually you'll slow down that
[941.00 → 942.00] elephant.
[942.00 → 943.00] Yeah?
[943.00 → 944.00] Mm-hmm.
[944.00 → 950.00] Now in this analogy, the atom is the elephant and the ping pong balls are light, literally
[950.00 → 952.00] photons, particles of light.
[952.00 → 953.00] Yeah?
[953.00 → 958.00] So the way you do this to get it to work, how do I explain it?
[958.00 → 961.00] Oh, this is going to be fun, actually cooling down atoms.
[961.00 → 962.00] This will be fun, right?
[962.00 → 963.00] I hope.
[963.00 → 964.00] Ice?
[964.00 → 965.00] Use ice?
[965.00 → 966.00] Use ice?
[966.00 → 967.00] Use ice.
[967.00 → 968.00] Use ice.
[968.00 → 969.00] Right, right, right.
[969.00 → 972.00] Because quite imagine, ice with ice, right?
[972.00 → 974.00] That's what temperature is, it's wiggliness.
[974.00 → 976.00] And what you're doing is you're trying to get rid of the wiggliness.
[976.00 → 978.00] Because when things are cold, they slow down.
[978.00 → 980.00] Yeah, that's what temperature is.
[980.00 → 983.00] It literally is less, if you've got more wiggliness, it's hotter.
[983.00 → 984.00] If it's less jiggly, it's colder.
[984.00 → 985.00] Yep.
[985.00 → 988.00] You can't ever go still, that would be absolute zero.
[988.00 → 989.00] You can't hit that.
[989.00 → 990.00] Right?
[990.00 → 991.00] Why not?
[991.00 → 992.00] Yeah, why not?
[992.00 → 998.00] That comes into quantum mechanics, and that's all to do with Heisenberg uncertainty.
[998.00 → 999.00] Okay.
[999.00 → 1000.00] Well, you just checkmated me with...
[1000.00 → 1002.00] The guy from Breaking Bad?
[1002.00 → 1005.00] Where does that come into this, Ginger Bill?
[1005.00 → 1007.00] Yeah, say my name.
[1007.00 → 1008.00] No, uh...
[1008.00 → 1011.00] No, so actually, to explain that...
[1011.00 → 1015.00] This is like, oh great.
[1015.00 → 1017.00] Explaining quantum mechanics to people is fun.
[1017.00 → 1018.00] So many new words.
[1018.00 → 1019.00] So many new words.
[1019.00 → 1020.00] So many new words.
[1020.00 → 1024.00] So what that means by the Heisenberg Centre principle is that there's...
[1024.00 → 1029.00] When you measure something, there's like a fundamental, something called action to the universe, and you can't go below it.
[1029.00 → 1032.00] So when you're measuring like the position of something, right?
[1032.00 → 1038.00] If you get below this limit, the product that you measure to get this action is the momentum, right?
[1038.00 → 1046.00] Then the uncertainty that you're measuring the position in, the uncertainty of the momentum would have to skyrocket.
[1046.00 → 1049.00] So actually, that means it's now jiggling even more.
[1049.00 → 1052.00] Or if you got that down, you don't know where the heck this atom is anymore.
[1052.00 → 1053.00] Right?
[1053.00 → 1054.00] Because we can't observe it.
[1054.00 → 1056.00] We can't send light or anything else at it.
[1056.00 → 1057.00] The uncertainty of it...
[1057.00 → 1058.00] It's going to hit it.
[1058.00 → 1061.00] You are observing it, just you think like the uncertainty gets spread so far.
[1061.00 → 1066.00] You can actually observe this uncertainty principle in like the macro world.
[1066.00 → 1067.00] It's not like a small level thing.
[1067.00 → 1069.00] You can actually see it in the big world.
[1069.00 → 1070.00] You can about...
[1070.00 → 1073.00] I haven't got demonstrate already to do this.
[1073.00 → 1074.00] Just find something on YouTube.
[1074.00 → 1076.00] It probably exists already to find a little thing.
[1076.00 → 1078.00] But that's why you can't get down to real absolute zero.
[1078.00 → 1082.00] Because effectively, you're reaching those certain limits.
[1082.00 → 1083.00] So when you get this cold...
[1083.00 → 1086.00] Well, can you just send a bunch of words I will never explain to anybody?
[1086.00 → 1087.00] Quick question.
[1087.00 → 1089.00] Because I'm sure people watching this are gonna want to know.
[1089.00 → 1092.00] Can this thing explode and just like blow everybody up?
[1094.00 → 1095.00] A quantum computer?
[1095.00 → 1096.00] I don't know.
[1096.00 → 1102.00] Because if I had a quantum computer in my attic and then like things got hot, would it blow me up?
[1102.00 → 1103.00] Great question.
[1103.00 → 1106.00] It depends on the cyber quantum computer, right?
[1106.00 → 1107.00] Because it depends on...
[1107.00 → 1110.00] If I remember correctly, there are different ways of making quantum computers.
[1110.00 → 1114.00] You can do like atoms, iron traps, there's photon based ones, there's all this, right?
[1114.00 → 1115.00] Oh yeah, you're right.
[1115.00 → 1116.00] It depends on what they represent, right?
[1116.00 → 1117.00] Of course.
[1117.00 → 1118.00] I think you clearly know this, right?
[1118.00 → 1119.00] You're in the no.
[1119.00 → 1120.00] I don't know what I...
[1120.00 → 1121.00] Which brand of photon one do you like?
[1121.00 → 1122.00] Why didn't I even say that?
[1122.00 → 1123.00] I knew that there are different types.
[1123.00 → 1124.00] Stupid me.
[1124.00 → 1125.00] Um...
[1125.00 → 1131.00] The short answer is yes, they could blow because you've got lasers to deal with.
[1131.00 → 1132.00] And these are not like...
[1132.00 → 1133.00] Ooh.
[1133.00 → 1134.00] Like the big lasers.
[1134.00 → 1139.00] Also, this is clearly not what I'd wear in a laser lab because a tie would be literally a health hazard.
[1139.00 → 1142.00] Because you're going over a bench of table and do that and like, ah, damn it.
[1142.00 → 1144.00] I've now burnt my tie and killed myself.
[1144.00 → 1146.00] That's how they find stuff out though.
[1146.00 → 1149.00] Like that's pretty much how microwaves got invented.
[1149.00 → 1150.00] Yeah.
[1150.00 → 1151.00] I heard...
[1151.00 → 1152.00] Yeah, the microwave.
[1152.00 → 1153.00] Someone is like...
[1153.00 → 1155.00] He noticed his chocolate bar melted in his back pocket, didn't they?
[1155.00 → 1157.00] Luckily, he didn't microwave his ass.
[1157.00 → 1158.00] But yeah, just the chocolate.
[1158.00 → 1159.00] It's true.
[1159.00 → 1160.00] That's real history.
[1160.00 → 1161.00] Yeah.
[1161.00 → 1162.00] You can...
[1162.00 → 1163.00] Let's get back on track.
[1163.00 → 1164.00] What's the...
[1164.00 → 1168.00] What's the radiation that develops in a lot of people's basements that they have to get tests on?
[1168.00 → 1169.00] Microplastics.
[1169.00 → 1170.00] No, it's radon.
[1170.00 → 1171.00] Radon.
[1171.00 → 1172.00] Radon gas.
[1172.00 → 1173.00] Radon's, um, literally an element, right?
[1173.00 → 1185.00] Yeah, some dude walked through some sort of checkpoint, and he was just like so nuclear that it like was setting off all sorts of alarms.
[1185.00 → 1186.00] What?!
[1186.00 → 1188.00] It turns out he should've like...
[1188.00 → 1193.00] He was probably going to die pretty soon, but it just turns out they discovered that there's this thing that happens in people's basements.
[1193.00 → 1194.00] Like, real story.
[1194.00 → 1195.00] Accidents.
[1195.00 → 1196.00] Well, it's not just basements, because it usually happens where near coal mines.
[1196.00 → 1200.00] If you've got a lot of coal deposits, you have to worry about radon gas.
[1200.00 → 1202.00] Um, like I live near my...
[1202.00 → 1205.00] My dad, my uncle, and my grandparents are all coal miners, right?
[1205.00 → 1207.00] So they always had to be careful of that as well.
[1207.00 → 1208.00] Do they have the black lung?
[1208.00 → 1210.00] No, none of them are fine.
[1210.00 → 1211.00] They're all fine for that.
[1211.00 → 1212.00] Okay, that's good.
[1212.00 → 1213.00] Yeah.
[1213.00 → 1214.00] Yeah.
[1214.00 → 1215.00] Yeah.
[1215.00 → 1216.00] There you go.
[1216.00 → 1217.00] But again, distracts.
[1217.00 → 1218.00] Quantum.
[1218.00 → 1219.00] We never go on topic.
[1219.00 → 1220.00] Quantum.
[1220.00 → 1221.00] Yeah, this is good.
[1221.00 → 1222.00] This is good.
[1222.00 → 1224.00] I'm actually loving this because I'm actually learning something also.
[1224.00 → 1225.00] Right?
[1225.00 → 1226.00] So, the other thing, if I'm doing the atoms, I've got a separate question.
[1226.00 → 1228.00] There's a minor thing I've missed out.
[1228.00 → 1229.00] Oh, go ahead.
[1229.00 → 1230.00] You go.
[1230.00 → 1231.00] You have to do it in a massive magnetic field, by the way, as well.
[1231.00 → 1233.00] You don't just shoot lasers at it in all directions.
[1233.00 → 1238.00] You have a magnetic field as well, which the way I'm trying to figure out how to, it gets
[1238.00 → 1239.00] into.
[1239.00 → 1243.00] Does magnetism just like help hold it because magnetism is so strong compared to like gravity
[1243.00 → 1244.00] and other stuff?
[1244.00 → 1245.00] Okay.
[1245.00 → 1247.00] So what you're doing, no, no, this is a trick.
[1247.00 → 1252.00] What you're doing with the magnetism and a really strong magnetic field is when you,
[1252.00 → 1254.00] how do I put this?
[1254.00 → 1260.00] Only certain wavelengths, certain frequencies or wavelengths or colours of photons can get absorbed
[1260.00 → 1261.00] by atoms, right?
[1261.00 → 1263.00] By the electrons in the atoms.
[1263.00 → 1265.00] They have to be exactly like certain frequencies.
[1265.00 → 1270.00] If you add an electric field, I'm trying to dumb this down, it can make those ranges a
[1270.00 → 1273.00] little bit fuzzier and easier to hit.
[1273.00 → 1276.00] It's about how to find levels and all this, right?
[1276.00 → 1277.00] Aim assist.
[1277.00 → 1278.00] Got it.
[1278.00 → 1279.00] Aim assist effectively.
[1279.00 → 1282.00] It's effectively aim assist because without it, you'd be screwed.
[1282.00 → 1283.00] Mm-hmm.
[1283.00 → 1284.00] Right?
[1284.00 → 1285.00] Yeah, like me playing Call of Duty.
[1285.00 → 1286.00] I got it.
[1286.00 → 1287.00] I'm following.
[1287.00 → 1288.00] That's why if you win the controller, you've got the aim assist, it's fine.
[1288.00 → 1290.00] It's a peer erase, clearly uses a mouse.
[1290.00 → 1291.00] Yes, right.
[1291.00 → 1293.00] So, fine like that.
[1293.00 → 1297.00] But that's kind of what you're doing with the magnetic fields.
[1297.00 → 1302.00] But if I remember also correctly, some of the early cubic ones were also like MRI,
[1302.00 → 1307.00] like effectively MRI machines, effectively is how they worked, which is a similar thing.
[1307.00 → 1311.00] You have to have the massive magnets, but instead of like, they do, there would have
[1311.00 → 1313.00] been like photons, but not necessarily lasers.
[1313.00 → 1317.00] They would have done like radio waves, which is how an MRI machine works.
[1317.00 → 1322.00] Effectively, you shoot, you've got giant magnetic field, you shoot radio waves at it, and then
[1322.00 → 1328.00] the, the hydro atoms in the water will effectively re-emit those photons as bits of light again,
[1328.00 → 1329.00] so you can see it.
[1329.00 → 1332.00] I haven't heard any of these words since I was in college.
[1332.00 → 1333.00] Yeah.
[1333.00 → 1337.00] Josh, you were supposed to be doing research for this episode.
[1337.00 → 1338.00] Yeah, it's research.
[1338.00 → 1339.00] This is research.
[1339.00 → 1340.00] This will be on the test at the end.
[1340.00 → 1342.00] I was watching videos for like five-year-olds.
[1342.00 → 1347.00] It was literally like, this was like for a 10-year-old, like, this is beyond that.
[1347.00 → 1349.00] Josh, let's stay on topic.
[1349.00 → 1350.00] Right, but that's it.
[1350.00 → 1353.00] That's my crash course in quantum computing for you done, guys.
[1353.00 → 1357.00] Okay, so I've got, I've got a question about them.
[1357.00 → 1359.00] So, I, so I get it.
[1359.00 → 1364.00] The, the thing that's very different about it is instead of ones and zeros, we have probability
[1364.00 → 1365.00] distributions.
[1365.00 → 1367.00] I feel like that's kind of like a big part of it.
[1367.00 → 1372.00] And then we can sample from those probability distributions like a lot of times, but it's
[1372.00 → 1377.00] better if we can make the probability distributions be more probable to give the answers that we
[1377.00 → 1378.00] want.
[1378.00 → 1379.00] Right?
[1379.00 → 1386.00] So, I have a shot to 56 algorithms.
[1386.00 → 1392.00] I write it for regular real computers that actually work and can go in consumers places
[1392.00 → 1395.00] and aren't like a government conspiracy like birds.
[1395.00 → 1396.00] I can do those.
[1396.00 → 1397.00] I write it at my house.
[1397.00 → 1398.00] I write it down.
[1398.00 → 1404.00] If I wanted to solve shot to 56 for quantum computers, we have to write a completely new
[1404.00 → 1411.00] style of algorithm that is all based around quantum gates and stuff like this.
[1411.00 → 1412.00] Yes.
[1412.00 → 1414.00] So they have higher level programming languages for, maybe, maybe we should go there and
[1414.00 → 1415.00] then I have questions about the last thing.
[1415.00 → 1416.00] No, no, I don't think so yet.
[1416.00 → 1420.00] I think those different, gates for people listening, maybe logic gates, you've got like
[1420.00 → 1422.00] and, or, not, this kind of things, right?
[1422.00 → 1423.00] They're logic gates in normal.
[1423.00 → 1425.00] That's how all computers are built, guys.
[1425.00 → 1426.00] We don't listen to how they're all built.
[1426.00 → 1427.00] We don't listen to how they're all built.
[1427.00 → 1428.00] Guys, we don't listen to how they're all built.
[1428.00 → 1430.00] We're not going to do any gatekeeping around here.
[1430.00 → 1431.00] Right, no gatekeeping.
[1431.00 → 1432.00] We're only ore gates.
[1432.00 → 1433.00] Ore gates only.
[1433.00 → 1434.00] I like Tors.
[1434.00 → 1435.00] Tors are nice.
[1435.00 → 1436.00] Yeah.
[1436.00 → 1437.00] Tors are nice.
[1437.00 → 1440.00] But on quantum computing, you have more gates.
[1440.00 → 1442.00] You have these different things entirely.
[1442.00 → 1443.00] Yes.
[1443.00 → 1444.00] And they don't even have the same logic.
[1444.00 → 1448.00] So one of them is, this is like a effectively it happens in like matrices, but they call
[1448.00 → 1452.00] it an demand or Hadamard, if I'm not going to do the French pronunciation.
[1452.00 → 1453.00] So the Hadamard.
[1453.00 → 1454.00] Thank you.
[1454.00 → 1455.00] Once, right?
[1455.00 → 1457.00] Because screw French pronunciations.
[1457.00 → 1461.00] I don't even get them wrong anyway, because that's not the correct pronunciation in my accent.
[1461.00 → 1462.00] And I'm like, oh, good God.
[1462.00 → 1464.00] We don't even like you.
[1464.00 → 1465.00] You don't, you're not, you weren't born in France.
[1465.00 → 1466.00] So it's fine.
[1466.00 → 1467.00] It's like, what can I do?
[1467.00 → 1468.00] I'm trying my best.
[1468.00 → 1469.00] They hate me anyway.
[1469.00 → 1470.00] So it's fine.
[1470.00 → 1471.00] Just by, yeah.
[1471.00 → 1473.00] So we got Hadamard thing.
[1473.00 → 1479.00] Hadamard is a normal Hadamard product in matrices is you just multiply each element by itself
[1479.00 → 1480.00] and that's it.
[1480.00 → 1485.00] So it's like a dot product effectively, but for matrices, but the Hadamard product for quantum
[1485.00 → 1489.00] mechanics, not quantum, quantum computing is effectively, you're changing, you're using
[1489.00 → 1494.00] this to change the basis vectors, the basis of the thing you're dealing with.
[1494.00 → 1495.00] So it effectively mixes.
[1495.00 → 1496.00] Trash.
[1496.00 → 1498.00] Basis vectors are like X, Y, and Z.
[1498.00 → 1499.00] They're, they point in a direction.
[1499.00 → 1500.00] Yeah.
[1500.00 → 1501.00] And then you're mixing them up a little bit.
[1501.00 → 1505.00] So instead of like having it this way, you're changing your basis to look like this or something.
[1505.00 → 1506.00] You're just rotating around.
[1506.00 → 1507.00] There we go.
[1507.00 → 1508.00] Effectively.
[1508.00 → 1510.00] And that's the what the Hadamard product does.
[1510.00 → 1511.00] Right.
[1511.00 → 1516.00] And then you can use that to make probability distributions look different.
[1516.00 → 1517.00] Right.
[1517.00 → 1518.00] That's my understanding.
[1518.00 → 1519.00] Yes.
[1519.00 → 1522.00] You can do, again, it's a simple, again, other things to add together.
[1522.00 → 1528.00] And most of these different gates are just different types of matrices at the end of the day.
[1528.00 → 1529.00] And they do different things.
[1529.00 → 1532.00] So that Hadamard, again, I'm doing it wrong.
[1532.00 → 1533.00] I'm wrong.
[1533.00 → 1535.00] It's effectively just as a slight rotation kind of thing.
[1535.00 → 1538.00] There's currently three whiteboards on TJ's camera right now.
[1538.00 → 1539.00] Trash, can you see this?
[1539.00 → 1540.00] Yep.
[1540.00 → 1541.00] Trash, can you see this?
[1541.00 → 1542.00] Yep.
[1542.00 → 1543.00] Okay.
[1543.00 → 1544.00] This is like X and Y, right?
[1544.00 → 1546.00] But really, you don't want to do that.
[1546.00 → 1551.00] You want to say that this one is like one or something like this and this one's two.
[1551.00 → 1552.00] That'll do.
[1552.00 → 1553.00] That'll do.
[1553.00 → 1554.00] Oh, right.
[1554.00 → 1555.00] Get those cats out there, man.
[1555.00 → 1556.00] Nice cats.
[1556.00 → 1557.00] I got my cats.
[1557.00 → 1558.00] I did my research.
[1558.00 → 1559.00] I'm using the bra as well.
[1559.00 → 1562.00] By the way, they are literally called bras and cats because Dirac was an autistic guy
[1562.00 → 1563.00] who thought it was funny.
[1563.00 → 1564.00] No!
[1564.00 → 1565.00] Bras and cats.
[1565.00 → 1566.00] I drew on my shirt.
[1566.00 → 1567.00] That's actually going to stay.
[1567.00 → 1569.00] That's 100% going to stay, and it's ruined now.
[1569.00 → 1570.00] Sorry.
[1570.00 → 1571.00] Oh, well.
[1571.00 → 1573.00] I'm actually, I'm going to have to call Michelle and get a new one.
[1573.00 → 1574.00] Okay.
[1574.00 → 1576.00] So you start, and you've got this guy.
[1576.00 → 1582.00] This represents a state vector for a quit, maybe.
[1582.00 → 1583.00] Yes.
[1583.00 → 1584.00] That's it.
[1584.00 → 1585.00] Yeah, yeah.
[1585.00 → 1586.00] This is good.
[1586.00 → 1587.00] Okay, got it.
[1587.00 → 1591.00] I'm trying to see where his knowledge ends because he's doing good so far.
[1591.00 → 1592.00] We're cooking.
[1592.00 → 1593.00] Chat.
[1593.00 → 1594.00] Okay, chat.
[1594.00 → 1596.00] Chat, if you're out here, comment, Dog, teach whiteboarding.
[1596.00 → 1597.00] Dog, thank you.
[1597.00 → 1598.00] Okay.
[1598.00 → 1600.00] So then we can do a Hadamard thing.
[1600.00 → 1603.00] We can reflect it across an axis.
[1603.00 → 1604.00] Then it looks like this.
[1604.00 → 1606.00] I think, I can't remember exactly the matrix, but it does affect me.
[1606.00 → 1607.00] It could do something like that.
[1607.00 → 1608.00] So we can move it around.
[1608.00 → 1609.00] Yeah, whatever.
[1609.00 → 1611.00] Far less confidence in that next line you drew.
[1611.00 → 1612.00] Okay.
[1612.00 → 1613.00] You're so right.
[1613.00 → 1614.00] I'm going to mix that.
[1614.00 → 1615.00] You're like, uh.
[1615.00 → 1616.00] You're so right.
[1616.00 → 1617.00] Thank you.
[1617.00 → 1618.00] You're absolutely correct.
[1618.00 → 1619.00] No.
[1619.00 → 1620.00] No.
[1620.00 → 1621.00] It's worse.
[1621.00 → 1624.00] I swear you're thinking about it too much now.
[1624.00 → 1625.00] I swear he's reading right off the screen.
[1625.00 → 1626.00] I think he's chatting.
[1626.00 → 1627.00] That's Tucson.
[1627.00 → 1628.00] That's it.
[1628.00 → 1629.00] That's it.
[1629.00 → 1630.00] That's it.
[1630.00 → 1631.00] But then what we can do.
[1631.00 → 1635.00] This one's not necessarily that helpful for finding out a better answer.
[1635.00 → 1636.00] We can also rotate them.
[1636.00 → 1639.00] I don't remember how we do that, but there are rotating gates that you can put stuff through.
[1639.00 → 1640.00] So imagine trash.
[1640.00 → 1643.00] You can get this arrow closer to this one.
[1643.00 → 1646.00] Eventually you could make it point at only cat two.
[1646.00 → 1652.00] So then the chances of getting the right answer are higher and higher and higher.
[1652.00 → 1655.00] And then we've solved the problem and I can hack your password.
[1655.00 → 1658.00] I don't know if that's right.
[1658.00 → 1659.00] How close am I Ginger Bill?
[1659.00 → 1665.00] I mean not the password hacking bit, but like you could literally, it's just linear algebra,
[1665.00 → 1666.00] man.
[1666.00 → 1667.00] It's just linear algebra.
[1667.00 → 1668.00] It's just linear.
[1668.00 → 1669.00] Loads of matrices.
[1669.00 → 1670.00] Yeah, but so are AI just linear algebra.
[1670.00 → 1671.00] Okay.
[1671.00 → 1672.00] Yeah.
[1672.00 → 1673.00] Everything's linear algebra at the end of the day, man.
[1673.00 → 1675.00] Everything's either linear algebra or wiggles.
[1675.00 → 1679.00] So this is how you guys are describing it, and it just makes it really confusing.
[1679.00 → 1681.00] Or at least this is how all quantum computers here.
[1681.00 → 1682.00] Here's my whiteboard.
[1682.00 → 1683.00] Okay.
[1683.00 → 1684.00] Now it's my time.
[1684.00 → 1685.00] That's a blackboard.
[1685.00 → 1688.00] What I'm talking about everything quantum, and I'm very confused by it is that you first
[1688.00 → 1692.00] start off with a state, and you somehow feed it a problem, right?
[1692.00 → 1696.00] You feed the quantum all the little gates, these little problems, and somehow it's able
[1696.00 → 1697.00] to take that problem.
[1697.00 → 1702.00] And then when you look at it, the probabilities are just aligned in the giant cloud space that
[1702.00 → 1706.00] is two to the N or whatever it is, uh, possibilities in here.
[1706.00 → 1707.00] It's just the correct N.
[1707.00 → 1711.00] It's the correct two to the N or two to the two to the N space.
[1711.00 → 1712.00] And it's just like, here's your answer.
[1712.00 → 1714.00] It's these 105 bits.
[1714.00 → 1717.00] And you're just like, how does it go to the correct answer?
[1717.00 → 1722.00] I can understand that leap where it goes from a pro probabilistically all the answers,
[1722.00 → 1725.00] but there's one once you observe it, and it's the correct one.
[1725.00 → 1726.00] Let me try.
[1726.00 → 1727.00] Let me try ginger bill.
[1727.00 → 1728.00] And then you can tell me where I go ahead.
[1728.00 → 1729.00] Go ahead.
[1729.00 → 1730.00] Okay.
[1730.00 → 1733.00] It all starts with the flux capacitor.
[1733.00 → 1734.00] Okay.
[1734.00 → 1735.00] Sorry.
[1735.00 → 1736.00] Okay.
[1736.00 → 1737.00] I'm kidding.
[1737.00 → 1738.00] I'm kidding.
[1738.00 → 1739.00] I'm kidding.
[1739.00 → 1740.00] I'm kidding.
[1740.00 → 1741.00] Let me try and answer it for real.
[1741.00 → 1742.00] I'm with you.
[1742.00 → 1743.00] This box that they put it in.
[1743.00 → 1744.00] For me.
[1744.00 → 1750.00] This is the thing that I think I'm getting, but I don't know for sure it, it has a custom
[1750.00 → 1755.00] algorithm to solve the question that you are trying to ask.
[1755.00 → 1756.00] Right.
[1756.00 → 1758.44] Build, just like an FPGA,
[1759.02 → 1761.04] field programmable gate array.
[1761.60 → 1764.62] That's literally, we build a custom computer
[1764.62 → 1767.30] to solve the problem that you want to put in.
[1767.50 → 1770.14] I built an FPGA that could play the game of life,
[1770.24 → 1771.34] where you would press buttons,
[1771.44 → 1772.54] and it would move you on stuff,
[1772.66 → 1773.64] and then you would press another button,
[1773.70 → 1775.16] you would go, or no, not game of life,
[1775.24 → 1776.04] shoots and ladders, sorry.
[1776.16 → 1777.88] I got confused because I know Prime loves game of life.
[1778.26 → 1778.52] I do.
[1779.10 → 1780.20] They could play shoots and ladders,
[1780.20 → 1781.84] and it would be like, you landed on 13,
[1782.20 → 1783.70] boom, you jumped all the way to 27.
[1784.26 → 1784.44] Boom.
[1784.58 → 1784.70] Right?
[1784.70 → 1786.94] And it was just, it was, but it was just an FPGA.
[1787.14 → 1788.68] It could only do that one thing.
[1789.24 → 1791.72] We will build quantum computers for now
[1791.72 → 1794.46] because we don't have a programming language
[1794.46 → 1797.70] for quantum computer that can solve particular problems.
[1798.42 → 1800.26] Maybe this willow chip from Google
[1800.26 → 1802.16] can be reprogrammed to do other things,
[1802.18 → 1803.56] or it has lots of gates or something
[1803.56 → 1804.56] that can let it do that.
[1805.12 → 1808.90] But like, so you have to build a custom quantum algorithm
[1808.90 → 1812.22] that can do basically a matrix transformation
[1812.22 → 1813.74] that takes some input
[1813.74 → 1815.42] and puts it into the output that you want.
[1815.62 → 1817.14] The thing that's different about it
[1817.14 → 1819.00] is it can do,
[1819.20 → 1821.30] not like a lot of them at once,
[1821.82 → 1822.86] but it can do,
[1823.00 → 1823.36] I don't know,
[1823.40 → 1824.52] I don't know how to describe it.
[1824.72 → 1825.42] So I don't know.
[1825.48 → 1826.40] There's my closest thing.
[1826.40 → 1828.14] It's not that it's all at once.
[1828.30 → 1828.56] This is,
[1828.62 → 1829.28] it's just that,
[1829.28 → 1831.44] that is the kind of mathematics you can do.
[1831.86 → 1832.22] Yes.
[1832.34 → 1832.70] Thank you.
[1832.70 → 1832.94] Right?
[1833.28 → 1834.92] It's just different
[1834.92 → 1836.54] is the better way of describing it.
[1836.54 → 1840.82] Yeah,
[1840.86 → 1841.68] it's hard to explain
[1841.68 → 1842.18] because it's like,
[1842.28 → 1842.50] it's like,
[1842.50 → 1843.44] that answered it.
[1843.66 → 1843.76] Okay.
[1844.80 → 1846.60] I'm more confusing ever right now.
[1846.92 → 1847.10] No,
[1847.14 → 1848.58] but the black box is not a
[1848.72 → 1849.08] like,
[1849.14 → 1851.50] I feel like when people say quantum computing,
[1851.70 → 1852.28] they're like,
[1852.34 → 1854.04] as soon as we get the quantum computer,
[1854.28 → 1855.30] passwords are dead.
[1855.30 → 1855.88] And you're like,
[1855.98 → 1864.58] we don't have an SHA-256 reverser quantum computer algorithm yet.
[1864.70 → 1864.88] Right?
[1864.94 → 1874.38] So we would have to still find a way to express that transformation in quantum computing gates
[1874.38 → 1876.90] or some higher level construct that could do that,
[1877.12 → 1880.28] that then could do the math to solve that question for you.
[1880.40 → 1881.66] And generally speaking,
[1881.74 → 1882.22] my understanding,
[1882.34 → 1883.16] maybe I'm wrong on this one,
[1883.20 → 1883.52] Ginger Bill,
[1883.52 → 1886.42] it's not that it solves it instantly,
[1887.34 → 1889.06] but that then,
[1889.18 → 1891.80] it's not like it's all of one time when we figure it out.
[1891.80 → 1892.06] No,
[1892.06 → 1893.22] now it's that there's some,
[1893.70 → 1894.76] instead of being like,
[1895.38 → 1896.26] SHA-256,
[1896.60 → 1898.90] and it's going to take a trillion years to solve it,
[1898.94 → 1899.14] it's like,
[1899.20 → 1900.66] now you could do it in like a day.
[1901.10 → 1904.34] To use the canonical example of a quantum algorithm with a Show's algorithm,
[1904.46 → 1904.58] right?
[1904.60 → 1906.96] Which is the one where you find the prime factors of an integer.
[1907.66 → 1908.74] On a quantum computer,
[1909.18 → 1911.20] you can factor like an integer n,
[1911.96 → 1912.26] right?
[1912.26 → 1915.14] And Show's algorithm can do this in polynomial time.
[1915.20 → 1915.48] In fact,
[1915.54 → 1917.54] I think it's proportional to the log of n,
[1918.20 → 1919.24] the time it takes.
[1919.88 → 1921.76] Whilst on a non-quantum computer,
[1922.30 → 1922.82] effectively,
[1922.96 → 1923.76] I think it's like,
[1924.26 → 1925.02] much,
[1925.12 → 1926.94] much slower than log n.
[1927.04 → 1927.16] I think,
[1927.30 → 1928.22] I don't think it's exponential,
[1928.36 → 1928.66] but it's like,
[1928.72 → 1929.58] maybe n factorial,
[1929.78 → 1930.66] or it could be something like that,
[1930.94 → 1931.38] which is,
[1931.38 → 1932.00] effectively,
[1932.08 → 1932.44] exponential.
[1933.68 → 1934.12] So it's very,
[1934.26 → 1934.56] very slow.
[1934.56 → 1935.66] I thought n factorial was bigger than exponential.
[1936.20 → 1936.72] It is,
[1936.84 → 1938.56] but it's close enough on the same order.
[1939.12 → 1939.38] Okay.
[1939.86 → 1941.56] I'm being lazy with my terms here.
[1942.94 → 1943.80] But in general,
[1943.86 → 1944.52] that means it's very,
[1944.62 → 1945.06] very slow,
[1945.16 → 1945.88] but the quantum one,
[1945.94 → 1946.60] they can do it again,
[1946.70 → 1947.14] log n,
[1947.32 → 1948.38] which means it's actually a lot,
[1948.46 → 1950.14] lot faster for this particular algorithm,
[1951.10 → 1953.52] is how it does it.
[1953.54 → 1954.72] And there is a way of doing it,
[1954.76 → 1957.18] but it has to be through the quantum algorithm.
[1957.32 → 1958.48] And the way you're doing it,
[1958.82 → 1960.82] it's effectively doing through this estimation thing.
[1960.82 → 1962.80] And a lot of them are,
[1963.74 → 1964.26] when you were saying,
[1964.32 → 1965.40] asking like the algorithm stuff,
[1965.46 → 1965.70] I'm doing,
[1965.92 → 1967.74] I'm trying to remember the show's algorithm off the top of my head,
[1967.94 → 1968.54] which is hard.
[1969.32 → 1970.44] And I'm also looking here,
[1970.48 → 1971.06] just even then,
[1971.10 → 1972.90] it's still not helpful with Wikipedia notes,
[1973.06 → 1975.20] because Wikipedia is written for PhDs.
[1977.56 → 1977.92] Yeah,
[1977.98 → 1978.44] but effectively,
[1978.44 → 1979.24] a lot of it is just,
[1979.24 → 1979.62] You have a doctor's coat on,
[1979.66 → 1980.22] you can read it.
[1980.74 → 1980.96] Yeah,
[1981.04 → 1982.14] this is a lab coat,
[1982.26 → 1983.54] this is actually my old lab coat,
[1983.54 → 1986.40] but made into a Halloween costume.
[1987.36 → 1987.76] So yeah,
[1988.04 → 1988.74] this is clearly,
[1988.84 → 1989.46] this is Halloween.
[1989.46 → 1990.14] There you go.
[1990.54 → 1991.98] Your career is now a joke.
[1992.98 → 1993.30] Yeah,
[1993.36 → 1993.64] it's a joke.
[1995.44 → 1995.80] But,
[1996.00 → 1996.90] it's not my career anymore,
[1997.44 → 1997.76] anymore,
[1997.82 → 1998.10] unfortunately.
[1998.28 → 1999.44] I don't know.
[1999.56 → 2000.52] I've had a lot of thought in it.
[2000.64 → 2000.76] Okay.
[2002.88 → 2003.20] But yeah,
[2003.26 → 2005.66] it's kind of one of those things where you just do a lot of the math,
[2005.70 → 2008.52] and you can break it down into these quantum logic gates,
[2008.76 → 2010.18] and such this way,
[2010.30 → 2012.36] but it just figured out what that algorithm is.
[2013.08 → 2013.44] So,
[2013.56 → 2014.02] the question is,
[2014.06 → 2016.04] how does it do this in the log n time?
[2016.62 → 2016.82] Well,
[2016.82 → 2017.38] it's kind of,
[2017.44 → 2019.44] it is kind of doing more to these estimations,
[2019.46 → 2020.78] estimations at once,
[2020.78 → 2023.96] which is why those probabilities work,
[2024.28 → 2025.92] and the ones that don't work effectively,
[2026.00 → 2027.04] they get filtered out.
[2027.64 → 2028.12] Another way of,
[2028.16 → 2029.20] another way of thinking about this through,
[2029.26 → 2029.82] is if I can,
[2031.12 → 2031.98] oh,
[2032.62 → 2034.14] you know when you do audio,
[2034.22 → 2034.76] and you've got an EQ,
[2035.14 → 2035.40] right?
[2036.46 → 2036.74] Yep.
[2037.48 → 2038.88] We do band pass filters,
[2038.98 → 2039.24] aren't you?
[2039.92 → 2040.28] Yeah.
[2040.70 → 2041.02] Good point.
[2041.02 → 2042.02] You're effectively doing that.
[2044.34 → 2046.10] That's how you filter out the stuff you want.
[2047.14 → 2047.38] So,
[2047.46 → 2048.34] if certain things come in,
[2048.38 → 2048.72] and they're like,
[2048.78 → 2049.86] they're well off the spectrum,
[2049.94 → 2050.68] they get filtered out,
[2050.74 → 2050.86] it's like,
[2050.90 → 2050.98] oh,
[2050.98 → 2052.46] they're not probably the right answer,
[2052.56 → 2053.12] nowhere near,
[2053.60 → 2054.68] they'll be much lower down,
[2054.84 → 2056.94] where the ones that might be close is the right answer,
[2057.02 → 2058.64] they'll get more amplified up.
[2059.08 → 2059.44] Right?
[2059.90 → 2061.86] This is like a Fourier transform thingy,
[2061.92 → 2063.20] a quantum Fourier transform specifically,
[2063.30 → 2063.50] but like,
[2063.54 → 2065.94] it's that kind of thingy-ma-bob.
[2067.04 → 2068.20] It's really hard to explain,
[2068.28 → 2070.12] because I'm not going into real complicated mathematics.
[2070.62 → 2071.40] I don't want to do that.
[2071.76 → 2073.10] Thank you for not doing that.
[2073.24 → 2074.08] Thank you for not doing that.
[2074.30 → 2075.44] I would have liked that.
[2075.46 → 2076.76] We'll do that on a separate episode.
[2076.78 → 2077.94] People watching this video in the comments,
[2078.04 → 2078.22] I'm like,
[2078.26 → 2078.74] I'm trying,
[2079.06 → 2079.44] guys,
[2079.54 → 2080.04] I'm trying.
[2080.72 → 2081.58] The thing is,
[2081.60 → 2083.00] no matter what you say,
[2083.52 → 2083.84] though,
[2083.96 → 2085.22] about quantum mechanics,
[2085.56 → 2086.10] quantum computers,
[2086.30 → 2087.80] somebody in the comment is going to say,
[2087.80 → 2087.98] well,
[2088.00 → 2088.86] they've already solved it,
[2088.90 → 2090.02] they've been lying to us all along.
[2090.08 → 2091.58] So somebody's going to be mad in the comments,
[2091.68 → 2092.24] no matter what.
[2092.44 → 2092.52] Yeah.
[2092.74 → 2092.88] True.
[2092.88 → 2093.64] You don't have to be worried.
[2093.84 → 2094.90] You can't keep them all happy,
[2095.04 → 2097.00] no matter how well you explain things.
[2097.30 → 2099.40] We need to go dumber right now.
[2100.68 → 2101.30] I don't know,
[2101.38 → 2103.06] but I actually don't know if we can.
[2104.20 → 2105.40] Follow-up question,
[2105.54 → 2106.78] follow-up question for this,
[2107.04 → 2107.36] Ginger bill,
[2107.48 → 2108.42] for Shores,
[2109.78 → 2114.30] it's not that we put in a number at the front
[2114.30 → 2117.18] into our mystical quantum computer box,
[2117.18 → 2118.96] and then in one shot,
[2119.48 → 2122.90] we're guaranteed to get out the prime factors,
[2123.26 → 2123.44] right?
[2123.66 → 2124.08] That's right,
[2124.14 → 2124.28] yeah.
[2124.80 → 2125.06] Okay,
[2125.14 → 2128.82] so then it runs multiple times with a new state vector,
[2129.16 → 2130.30] just like if we were,
[2130.44 → 2135.24] if we wrote a really dumb classical computer example of,
[2135.52 → 2135.78] like,
[2135.82 → 2138.06] I'm going to find the prime factors by just like,
[2138.12 → 2140.06] literally like guessing random numbers,
[2140.24 → 2140.40] and I'm,
[2140.48 → 2142.24] or I'm going to go start at zero,
[2142.24 → 2143.58] and I'm going to go to,
[2143.82 → 2143.94] well,
[2143.98 → 2144.50] obviously not zero,
[2144.56 → 2145.42] I'm going to start at one,
[2145.76 → 2146.92] I'm going to go all the way to here
[2146.92 → 2147.70] and see which one's,
[2147.80 → 2147.96] in fact,
[2147.96 → 2148.54] I'm going to start,
[2148.80 → 2149.90] and then we like,
[2150.00 → 2151.50] just keep guessing until we find them,
[2151.56 → 2152.74] because it's a search problem.
[2153.40 → 2153.52] Yeah.
[2153.70 → 2153.86] Right?
[2154.86 → 2156.24] And so there's just better search,
[2156.28 → 2157.82] or there's a better way to branch prune,
[2158.02 → 2158.78] is what you're saying,
[2158.84 → 2159.34] is that you can.
[2159.34 → 2159.66] Yes.
[2159.66 → 2161.52] Because when you think,
[2161.56 → 2162.50] when you think it's about statistical,
[2162.64 → 2162.76] right,
[2162.80 → 2163.08] because again,
[2163.14 → 2163.68] with the quantum stuff,
[2163.72 → 2165.44] there's a lot of noise due to the stuff.
[2166.20 → 2166.56] Earlier,
[2166.86 → 2168.56] classical computers had a lot of noise to them as well,
[2168.60 → 2169.00] by the way.
[2169.56 → 2171.84] It's just that nowadays we've gotten so good at this,
[2172.04 → 2172.26] in fact,
[2172.30 → 2172.38] well,
[2172.38 → 2172.84] not really,
[2173.38 → 2174.92] but we've gotten better at it nowadays,
[2175.02 → 2176.02] that you don't get the noise.
[2177.06 → 2177.96] Sometimes you hit it,
[2178.06 → 2178.16] like,
[2178.24 → 2179.58] especially like the newer RAM stuff,
[2179.64 → 2180.64] where they're so crammed together,
[2180.72 → 2181.92] like the transistors are,
[2182.44 → 2183.32] where they start to get,
[2183.40 → 2183.50] like,
[2183.54 → 2185.60] you get error happening with the RAM,
[2185.82 → 2185.96] like,
[2186.02 → 2186.48] even in classical,
[2186.58 → 2188.18] because quantum effects start happening,
[2188.66 → 2188.90] right?
[2189.66 → 2190.18] Um,
[2190.34 → 2190.84] they effectively,
[2191.12 → 2191.86] things get noisy,
[2192.00 → 2193.64] the electrons jump between everything,
[2193.76 → 2194.50] and I say electrons,
[2194.62 → 2194.84] but I mean,
[2194.88 → 2195.86] everything gets fuzzy.
[2196.30 → 2196.96] So you get,
[2197.28 → 2197.86] that's why you need,
[2197.92 → 2198.00] like,
[2198.04 → 2199.40] error correcting memory a lot of the time,
[2199.46 → 2199.82] sometimes,
[2200.26 → 2201.28] to get rid of that.
[2202.48 → 2202.84] Uh,
[2202.92 → 2203.80] but when in quantum,
[2203.94 → 2204.12] it's like,
[2204.16 → 2204.86] it's fundamentally,
[2205.24 → 2205.48] yeah,
[2205.54 → 2206.44] everything's just noisy,
[2206.56 → 2207.02] and you're trying,
[2207.08 → 2208.02] and if you do multiple times,
[2208.10 → 2210.82] those multiple runs will then clean things up.
[2210.94 → 2212.68] So think of it as effectively as like a
[2213.74 → 2214.08] uh,
[2214.24 → 2214.96] like,
[2215.16 → 2216.58] path tracing or something like that.
[2217.06 → 2217.84] And then our,
[2218.22 → 2218.46] our,
[2218.46 → 2219.50] as we do more,
[2219.50 → 2220.12] our iterations,
[2220.80 → 2222.62] our state vectors,
[2222.82 → 2225.30] probability ends up looking more like,
[2226.34 → 2227.86] instead of being like,
[2228.24 → 2228.56] you know,
[2228.64 → 2231.12] we have a 0.3,
[2231.28 → 2232.16] 0.4,
[2232.30 → 2233.28] 0.2,
[2233.42 → 2234.68] that's 0.1.
[2235.36 → 2235.84] We like,
[2235.94 → 2237.54] end at something like,
[2237.66 → 2237.82] oh,
[2237.88 → 2238.78] we're pretty sure it's,
[2238.90 → 2239.84] this one is nine,
[2240.02 → 2240.94] or I guess it would be like,
[2241.64 → 2242.10] five,
[2242.26 → 2242.84] five,
[2243.18 → 2244.18] 0.0,
[2244.18 → 2245.18] 0.0,
[2245.18 → 2245.76] and then like,
[2245.82 → 2246.42] 0.45.
[2246.76 → 2247.06] Like,
[2247.10 → 2247.82] if we had two,
[2247.90 → 2249.44] two slots that we needed to go to,
[2249.48 → 2249.64] we'd be like,
[2249.70 → 2249.82] oh,
[2249.84 → 2249.96] well,
[2249.96 → 2250.30] that's,
[2250.64 → 2250.86] actually,
[2250.90 → 2251.66] these don't go to zero,
[2251.74 → 2251.84] though.
[2251.84 → 2252.62] They'd be like one,
[2252.70 → 2253.34] or something like that.
[2253.40 → 2253.50] Yeah,
[2253.56 → 2253.88] very small,
[2253.94 → 2254.24] very small,
[2254.30 → 2254.40] yeah.
[2254.54 → 2255.76] Because we can make them zero,
[2255.84 → 2256.74] that would be not right.
[2256.80 → 2257.96] But we can make them tiny,
[2258.06 → 2258.48] and then we're like,
[2258.54 → 2258.68] oh,
[2258.74 → 2260.08] when we get out of the thing,
[2260.08 → 2260.66] absolute zero?
[2261.38 → 2262.02] Absolute zero,
[2262.10 → 2262.62] can't do it.
[2264.76 → 2265.72] Absolutely not.
[2265.98 → 2266.24] Actually,
[2266.32 → 2267.36] because the
[2267.36 → 2267.92] the hopper,
[2268.00 → 2268.22] bloody,
[2268.34 → 2268.60] bloody,
[2268.60 → 2269.22] bloody thing.
[2269.74 → 2269.84] Right?
[2270.08 → 2270.20] Yeah.
[2271.12 → 2272.00] It's your turn.
[2273.44 → 2273.80] Yep.
[2275.24 → 2275.64] Uncertainty,
[2276.00 → 2277.28] is actually intrinsic to the world.
[2277.32 → 2278.24] It's not like the quantum thing.
[2278.56 → 2279.36] It literally is,
[2279.48 → 2281.56] what is the level of your measuring tool?
[2282.06 → 2283.20] If you've got like a ruler,
[2283.30 → 2284.26] significant figures.
[2284.90 → 2285.08] Yeah,
[2285.16 → 2285.28] yeah.
[2285.54 → 2286.24] You've always got like,
[2286.30 → 2286.70] literally like,
[2286.72 → 2287.78] if your ruler goes to,
[2287.84 → 2288.12] I don't know,
[2288.60 → 2288.70] in,
[2289.10 → 2289.90] say,
[2289.90 → 2290.40] millimetres,
[2291.46 → 2292.16] the error on that,
[2292.20 → 2292.56] is going to be like,
[2292.60 → 2293.26] half a millimetre,
[2293.44 → 2293.66] right?
[2293.76 → 2294.90] When you can't be any more accurate,
[2294.90 → 2295.40] than like,
[2295.40 → 2295.84] half a millimetre.
[2296.92 → 2297.20] Okay.
[2297.88 → 2299.66] Let's do 30 seconds of an inch,
[2299.86 → 2300.10] right?
[2300.28 → 2300.44] Oh,
[2300.54 → 2301.04] thank you,
[2301.04 → 2301.06] finally.
[2301.06 → 2302.04] So in 30 seconds of an inch,
[2302.52 → 2302.70] yeah?
[2302.84 → 2303.20] Finally.
[2303.66 → 2304.64] If you have 30 seconds of an inch,
[2304.66 → 2305.44] or 16th of an inch,
[2305.48 → 2306.34] let's say 16th of an inch,
[2306.38 → 2307.08] on your tape measure,
[2307.16 → 2307.30] right?
[2307.34 → 2308.34] Because you usually go down to 16th of an inch,
[2308.34 → 2308.44] Yeah,
[2308.46 → 2310.10] then obviously you have a 30-second error.
[2310.60 → 2311.52] You've got a 30-second error,
[2311.64 → 2311.90] right?
[2312.02 → 2312.84] On any of your measurements.
[2313.44 → 2313.96] So fundamentally,
[2314.18 → 2314.76] your error,
[2315.12 → 2316.32] is on your measuring stick.
[2316.32 → 2318.42] You can't get rid of this uncertainty.
[2318.76 → 2320.20] Your uncertainty is fundamentally there.
[2320.26 → 2321.32] This is not like a quantum thing.
[2321.38 → 2323.66] This is just a measuring stick thing.
[2324.44 → 2328.10] And you could hypothetically get less and less and less to make it more accurate,
[2328.46 → 2330.54] but you get more accurate in the thing that you're measuring.
[2331.10 → 2333.62] The thing that quantum mechanics brings in is this actually,
[2333.76 → 2334.16] there's a
[2334.46 → 2335.64] something associated with it.
[2335.66 → 2337.68] You would start losing that information as well.
[2337.92 → 2338.60] Like you can't go,
[2338.72 → 2340.32] you can get more accurate on one thing,
[2340.80 → 2342.40] but once you get very,
[2342.50 → 2344.04] very close to this like fundamental limit,
[2344.10 → 2344.78] the thing gets fuzzier,
[2345.10 → 2345.24] right?
[2345.26 → 2345.88] The other thing goes,
[2346.08 → 2347.50] the uncertainty of the other thing,
[2347.84 → 2348.80] and if it's position,
[2349.18 → 2349.78] momentum goes.
[2349.86 → 2350.48] If it's time,
[2350.60 → 2351.30] energy goes,
[2351.62 → 2351.84] right?
[2353.12 → 2354.48] So they're the kind of,
[2354.62 → 2355.36] the different things,
[2355.44 → 2356.32] your uncertainty.
[2356.56 → 2357.80] So that's another thing I want to be very clear.
[2357.80 → 2360.10] The uncertainty principle is everywhere.
[2360.30 → 2361.66] You do it in real life.
[2362.12 → 2362.64] Like it's not just quantum.
[2362.64 → 2364.74] I got a good example from real life.
[2365.56 → 2365.96] Trash,
[2366.02 → 2367.24] I know you'll relate to this one.
[2367.76 → 2369.46] If your kids are playing in a different room,
[2369.94 → 2373.10] they act different from if you're in the same room with them.
[2373.92 → 2374.96] Under observation,
[2375.22 → 2376.94] the children act differently.
[2377.34 → 2378.96] That's the same thing with electrons.
[2379.78 → 2380.08] Okay.
[2380.74 → 2382.10] I don't know if that's actually a good example.
[2382.10 → 2383.10] So if I go look at an electron,
[2383.22 → 2383.88] it's going to slow down?
[2384.34 → 2384.90] It's going to,
[2384.90 → 2386.30] it's going to play really nice.
[2386.46 → 2387.22] Slow down over there.
[2387.22 → 2389.08] Like nice with its brother and sister.
[2390.28 → 2390.90] So I just,
[2391.10 → 2393.42] they're not probably looking at like a bunch of electrons.
[2393.64 → 2394.68] They're acting differently now.
[2395.70 → 2396.06] Yes.
[2396.10 → 2397.58] They're acting like they didn't do anything.
[2397.90 → 2399.64] They'll have that weird cancel dance.
[2400.10 → 2400.82] Or they're just like this.
[2401.24 → 2401.56] Me?
[2402.20 → 2402.50] Oh,
[2402.76 → 2402.96] hey,
[2403.06 → 2403.46] hey dad.
[2404.10 → 2405.10] We're just hanging out.
[2405.18 → 2406.04] It's totally normal here.
[2406.30 → 2407.62] I'm just going to start walking around my house.
[2407.70 → 2407.90] Hey,
[2408.16 → 2408.78] I see you.
[2409.14 → 2409.88] See you over there.
[2413.10 → 2413.46] Okay.
[2413.46 → 2416.04] I've got a follow-up question about the next part of quantum computers.
[2416.04 → 2417.40] I don't understand ginger film.
[2417.94 → 2422.92] What are people planning on actually using them for besides spending a lot of research money?
[2424.40 → 2425.80] That's a very good question.
[2426.30 → 2426.88] Thank you.
[2427.30 → 2427.80] And the answer is,
[2427.84 → 2430.12] I think it's just spending a lot of research money currently.
[2430.68 → 2430.98] Yep.
[2430.98 → 2432.94] But a lot of it is like,
[2433.04 → 2433.30] again,
[2433.36 → 2434.20] they want to break encryption.
[2434.46 → 2434.62] A lot,
[2434.76 → 2435.18] like again,
[2435.26 → 2436.56] Shores ALGOL is a good example of this.
[2436.66 → 2439.22] If they can break a lot of basics like RSA encryption,
[2439.78 → 2441.14] you've broken it.
[2442.08 → 2442.40] You can have all the big points.
[2442.40 → 2444.64] Now I know there is some encryption which is like quantum,
[2444.82 → 2446.24] like safe already.
[2447.24 → 2447.54] I just,
[2448.14 → 2448.18] but.
[2448.24 → 2448.92] Elliptical hash?
[2449.62 → 2449.94] Yeah.
[2450.06 → 2450.80] Or elliptical curve?
[2451.12 → 2451.30] Sorry.
[2451.36 → 2451.84] Whatever they are.
[2451.88 → 2453.04] Elliptical curve madness.
[2453.04 → 2456.04] Some of them stuff is like,
[2457.56 → 2457.88] you know,
[2457.94 → 2459.12] it's impossible to break quantum computers.
[2459.22 → 2460.68] They just don't have an advantage anymore.
[2461.80 → 2463.28] So a lot of this is they just try.
[2463.70 → 2464.56] It's because it's like,
[2464.60 → 2467.98] you need step-by-step process and the resolution of each step is now.
[2468.48 → 2468.84] Oh,
[2468.90 → 2469.74] that's really smart.
[2470.60 → 2471.44] I don't know if that's true,
[2471.48 → 2474.04] but I think it's something along those lines where there's like a
[2474.04 → 2477.38] a dependency problem that becomes really difficult for it.
[2478.50 → 2478.86] Yeah.
[2478.86 → 2480.44] And I know there's certain other algorithms because again,
[2480.46 → 2481.36] it's all probabilistic.
[2481.56 → 2483.50] Some of the algorithms also do like,
[2483.76 → 2483.96] you know,
[2483.96 → 2485.24] like a random walk.
[2485.24 → 2486.72] Have you ever heard of a random walk before?
[2487.34 → 2487.86] Monte Carlo.
[2488.24 → 2488.44] Boom.
[2488.70 → 2489.16] Like Monte Carlo.
[2489.26 → 2489.32] Yeah.
[2489.34 → 2490.58] But random walk for people who don't know,
[2490.68 → 2492.30] imagine a drunk man in a field.
[2492.70 → 2494.50] He will walk randomly eventually,
[2494.64 → 2497.22] but eventually he will get out of the field.
[2497.98 → 2499.40] After a certain amount of time.
[2499.96 → 2501.36] Give him enough time.
[2501.50 → 2503.02] Put me in a field right now.
[2503.20 → 2503.68] I'll see if I can.
[2503.88 → 2504.04] Wait,
[2504.18 → 2504.98] right now.
[2505.08 → 2505.68] I'm going to sleep.
[2505.68 → 2506.40] That's in two dimensions,
[2506.54 → 2506.84] by the way.
[2506.86 → 2507.70] That's in two dimensions.
[2508.22 → 2509.06] And then when you get to three,
[2509.14 → 2509.42] it's fine.
[2509.54 → 2509.84] And after,
[2510.16 → 2510.66] but the thing is,
[2510.66 → 2512.84] there's these called quantum walks,
[2512.90 → 2513.06] right?
[2513.10 → 2513.64] Which is slightly,
[2514.58 → 2516.28] it's not a random man in a field at this point.
[2516.34 → 2517.00] It's a very quantum,
[2517.12 → 2517.80] tiny little thing.
[2518.06 → 2518.44] Not really,
[2518.50 → 2518.94] but it's just like,
[2519.00 → 2519.96] it does quantum stuff,
[2520.18 → 2520.40] right?
[2520.56 → 2523.16] And there are a lot of algorithms that help when you do like quantum walk
[2523.16 → 2525.00] things,
[2525.66 → 2525.98] right?
[2527.14 → 2527.62] So,
[2527.98 → 2530.20] that's another one to use with quantum things.
[2530.20 → 2531.34] And they can make it go much,
[2531.40 → 2533.88] much faster with quantum algorithms than they can do with classical.
[2535.24 → 2536.72] I'm just trying to think of anything else,
[2536.80 → 2537.96] which I can describe.
[2539.58 → 2539.80] Well,
[2539.88 → 2540.02] here,
[2540.14 → 2541.24] maybe to help jog your memory,
[2541.36 → 2542.82] I did draw this picture of trash.
[2543.18 → 2545.06] He is very confused right now.
[2545.06 → 2550.28] That might be the thumbnail.
[2551.74 → 2554.52] I tried to give you anime eyes.
[2554.88 → 2556.32] I'm not very good at drawing.
[2556.52 → 2557.76] Those are terrifying.
[2557.92 → 2558.24] Thank you.
[2558.32 → 2558.50] Thank you.
[2558.58 → 2559.78] Right into my soul.
[2559.78 → 2563.26] All right.
[2563.26 → 2563.50] All right.
[2563.50 → 2563.74] All right.
[2563.74 → 2563.76] All right.
[2563.76 → 2564.24] So let's,
[2564.46 → 2568.06] I want to talk about the willow thing because obviously the example that they
[2568.06 → 2573.16] gave was that they're going to help do predict of various structures of
[2573.16 → 2573.56] some sort.
[2573.62 → 2574.04] I think it was,
[2574.26 → 2575.32] it's not protein structures.
[2575.32 → 2579.24] It was like structures for specific organic compounds.
[2579.24 → 2580.34] If I remember correctly,
[2580.46 → 2581.92] I can't remember exactly what,
[2582.00 → 2582.62] what was their,
[2582.70 → 2583.54] uh,
[2583.56 → 2584.06] what was their,
[2584.16 → 2584.52] uh,
[2584.52 → 2585.14] examples,
[2585.30 → 2589.64] but does that mean based on everything you've just said that the willow chip
[2589.64 → 2592.20] really truly is like a single serve chip,
[2592.20 → 2596.26] that it can only do this predictive thing or are they retro,
[2596.26 → 2599.38] are they reprogrammable like field programmable Gatorade?
[2599.50 → 2599.64] I,
[2599.86 → 2601.52] I don't know fully,
[2601.52 → 2603.90] but I think they're probably single purpose chips currently.
[2604.56 → 2605.04] Wow.
[2605.20 → 2605.40] Okay.
[2605.40 → 2605.94] And these chips,
[2606.02 → 2608.96] you have to also run at like negative two 71.
[2610.04 → 2610.32] Yeah.
[2610.32 → 2610.50] Yeah.
[2610.50 → 2610.60] Yeah.
[2610.60 → 2611.04] Like very,
[2611.10 → 2612.10] very cold Celsius.
[2612.62 → 2613.34] And what is it?
[2613.36 → 2616.56] Negative four 86 Fahrenheit or whatever it is like that.
[2616.84 → 2617.04] No,
[2617.06 → 2617.46] we don't,
[2617.56 → 2619.00] we don't use those units.
[2619.02 → 2619.26] Okay.
[2619.32 → 2619.62] Celsius.
[2619.78 → 2619.92] Oh,
[2619.92 → 2620.16] okay.
[2620.24 → 2620.40] Okay.
[2620.40 → 2621.40] We can use Calvin though.
[2621.84 → 2622.06] Yeah.
[2622.06 → 2622.24] Yeah.
[2622.24 → 2623.32] It's like one.
[2623.32 → 2624.18] Big fan of the clothes.
[2624.36 → 2624.48] Yeah.
[2624.80 → 2625.00] Yeah.
[2625.28 → 2626.34] Much less than one actually,
[2626.44 → 2626.74] but yeah.
[2628.08 → 2628.40] Yeah.
[2628.70 → 2629.02] Yeah.
[2629.64 → 2630.40] I was going to,
[2630.40 → 2630.70] I was going to,
[2630.70 → 2631.50] I was going to call that out,
[2631.56 → 2632.10] but I didn't want to.
[2632.58 → 2632.82] Yeah.
[2633.00 → 2633.28] Very,
[2633.36 → 2634.48] very cold is what I'm saying.
[2634.56 → 2634.74] Yeah.
[2635.10 → 2636.58] Because they want to minimize the noise.
[2636.84 → 2637.98] They want to minimize the noise.
[2637.98 → 2639.10] They have to get it very cold.
[2639.68 → 2641.82] They want no noise and thing like that.
[2641.96 → 2642.20] Okay.
[2643.24 → 2644.58] So when you say they have to research,
[2644.68 → 2649.08] that means every single problem that potentially contains quantum supremacy,
[2649.08 → 2652.80] they have to first like hand construct,
[2652.92 → 2653.46] not just like,
[2653.54 → 2655.72] these are not FPGAs where they're more general purpose.
[2655.78 → 2658.36] They actually have to do like ASICs for every single problem,
[2658.68 → 2660.14] except in the quantum whale.
[2660.14 → 2660.46] I think so again,
[2660.74 → 2661.46] which is much more confusing.
[2661.46 → 2664.64] People tell me I'm completely wrong, and they're probably right being completely wrong.
[2664.98 → 2665.40] Cause again,
[2665.48 → 2666.56] this is not my field.
[2666.80 → 2668.28] I know I've got the lab coat,
[2668.66 → 2670.88] but it doesn't mean it's actually my field.
[2670.96 → 2672.18] He's a compiler dev these days.
[2672.48 → 2672.60] Okay.
[2672.60 → 2674.28] Do you know any reason why,
[2674.28 → 2674.82] um,
[2675.32 → 2677.60] like generalized programming languages can't,
[2677.66 → 2679.52] or currently don't exist for this?
[2679.64 → 2680.98] Like how is there not just some,
[2681.98 → 2682.74] I assume,
[2682.86 → 2683.46] cause all the problems in some sense are the same.
[2683.46 → 2684.86] I think there probably are,
[2685.26 → 2687.74] but they're probably the equivalent of assembly at the moment.
[2687.74 → 2695.02] We haven't had that revolution to get to like the equivalent of like C or Pascal for computers yet.
[2695.08 → 2695.62] Or the algorithm.
[2695.62 → 2696.08] Or Odin.
[2697.08 → 2698.66] Because the thing is modern,
[2698.82 → 2700.26] like normal programmers things,
[2700.34 → 2700.90] they're all classical.
[2701.04 → 2702.80] They're based on classical logic,
[2703.52 → 2703.66] right?
[2703.74 → 2704.32] Get ANDs,
[2704.42 → 2704.86] not,
[2704.98 → 2705.34] ORS,
[2705.44 → 2705.92] oars,
[2706.52 → 2707.32] that kind of thing.
[2707.82 → 2709.56] So they do have some stuff though.
[2710.06 → 2710.18] I just,
[2710.18 → 2710.32] yeah,
[2710.32 → 2711.74] they probably have some stuff already,
[2711.74 → 2713.56] which is why they represent all the gates,
[2713.64 → 2717.70] but it's effectively like drawing circuit diagrams at the end of the day is what they're doing.
[2717.74 → 2719.50] So they have an open source Python,
[2719.50 → 2720.86] uh,
[2721.18 → 2721.90] CIRC circuit,
[2722.06 → 2724.54] but it is basically like what you're saying though.
[2724.60 → 2724.78] Yeah.
[2724.78 → 2725.56] As I said,
[2725.60 → 2727.52] it's effectively assembly language level.
[2727.60 → 2727.76] Right.
[2727.86 → 2728.18] Not,
[2728.92 → 2729.30] um,
[2729.30 → 2730.60] you construct the circuit.
[2730.80 → 2731.24] It looks like,
[2731.44 → 2732.92] you're constructing the circuit with Python.
[2733.02 → 2735.24] It's not like Python is being run on these machines.
[2735.24 → 2735.56] Yes.
[2735.62 → 2735.78] Right.
[2735.84 → 2736.00] Yeah.
[2736.00 → 2736.10] Yeah.
[2736.10 → 2737.36] Python to construct the thing.
[2737.40 → 2738.26] So it's kind of like,
[2739.08 → 2739.38] effectively,
[2739.38 → 2740.86] you're just writing a compiler.
[2741.58 → 2741.86] Um,
[2741.92 → 2742.20] yes.
[2743.12 → 2743.82] And that's why,
[2743.88 → 2745.82] so I think the reason why they haven't found this yet,
[2745.86 → 2746.56] because also it's like,
[2746.70 → 2746.80] they,
[2746.88 → 2747.52] I don't need it.
[2747.52 → 2749.30] Like think back in the day when I was von Neumann,
[2749.78 → 2750.50] not a joke.
[2750.56 → 2753.22] Von Neumann believed assembly language was to,
[2753.30 → 2754.16] it was not programming.
[2754.22 → 2757.74] So the only real person should literally write the machine code.
[2758.64 → 2759.66] Like he believed like,
[2759.70 → 2759.92] Oh yeah,
[2759.98 → 2760.20] you should,
[2760.60 → 2761.68] if you're not doing real program,
[2761.74 → 2762.56] unless you do machine code.
[2762.56 → 2763.66] I do love that.
[2763.66 → 2764.80] I do love that von Neumann was,
[2764.88 → 2765.16] uh,
[2765.40 → 2769.30] it was like effectively just like a Twitter rage baiter back in the day.
[2769.34 → 2769.66] Just like,
[2769.70 → 2769.84] yeah,
[2769.90 → 2771.06] that's not real programmers.
[2771.26 → 2771.92] That's not real programmers.
[2772.62 → 2772.86] Dude,
[2773.02 → 2775.00] I would love seeing him on X.
[2775.16 → 2775.84] Say students,
[2775.94 → 2777.16] but like one of his postgrads saying,
[2777.22 → 2777.38] you know,
[2777.42 → 2777.82] you shouldn't be making,
[2777.88 → 2778.66] why are you making an assembly?
[2778.76 → 2779.84] Just write the machine code.
[2779.92 → 2780.30] Come on.
[2780.30 → 2782.70] I also did,
[2782.78 → 2783.10] by the way,
[2783.16 → 2784.62] just look up Willow.
[2784.86 → 2786.30] According to some searching,
[2786.62 → 2791.02] less than 20 millikelvins is where it needs to run at.
[2791.34 → 2791.68] Pretty cold.
[2791.90 → 2792.76] Very cold.
[2793.78 → 2794.42] So is there,
[2794.42 → 2794.82] is there,
[2794.82 → 2798.42] is there a future where people can actually run quantum computers or is this
[2798.42 → 2800.66] forever in Sergey Brin's basement?
[2800.82 → 2801.64] Like you just can't,
[2802.12 → 2803.68] you have to be the ultra,
[2803.68 → 2807.34] ultra wealthy company to be able to have any access to this in the next 50 years.
[2808.04 → 2809.32] So the answer is,
[2809.74 → 2810.26] uh,
[2810.30 → 2814.22] most likely most people's basements for the next few decades,
[2814.30 → 2816.20] unless if they get like,
[2816.32 → 2816.50] uh,
[2816.50 → 2818.94] let's say photonic based ones better.
[2819.14 → 2821.50] Cause usually they can work at multiple temperatures or whatever.
[2821.70 → 2824.64] Or if they found out a room temperature semiconductor.
[2825.88 → 2826.32] That,
[2826.58 → 2826.66] Oh,
[2826.74 → 2828.98] well X was really hopping with that.
[2829.08 → 2830.04] When was that last year?
[2830.58 → 2831.14] Not semiconductor,
[2831.42 → 2832.00] superconductor,
[2832.06 → 2832.24] right?
[2832.86 → 2833.04] Sorry.
[2833.10 → 2833.48] Superconductor.
[2833.54 → 2833.66] Sorry.
[2833.74 → 2833.80] Yeah.
[2833.80 → 2834.16] Superconductor.
[2834.22 → 2834.34] Sorry.
[2834.34 → 2834.52] Okay.
[2834.60 → 2835.94] It got him with an S.
[2835.94 → 2836.42] It's close enough.
[2836.58 → 2836.60] Dude,
[2836.60 → 2838.54] my semiconductors are going hard right now at room temperature.
[2838.64 → 2839.48] I don't know what you're talking about.
[2839.48 → 2840.38] Right.
[2840.46 → 2841.34] So very soon.
[2841.66 → 2842.78] Semi superconductor.
[2842.86 → 2843.14] It's not good.
[2843.20 → 2843.72] Why am I saying this?
[2843.80 → 2844.06] Get it right.
[2844.44 → 2844.76] Superconductor.
[2844.82 → 2845.00] Right.
[2845.68 → 2846.60] And because at the moment,
[2846.72 → 2847.16] most of them,
[2847.28 → 2848.80] there are some superconductor based,
[2848.80 → 2849.20] uh,
[2849.20 → 2850.08] quantum computings,
[2850.22 → 2850.96] computers out there.
[2851.02 → 2851.44] But again,
[2851.44 → 2852.06] you have to have them very,
[2852.16 → 2852.58] very cold.
[2854.06 → 2854.38] Interesting.
[2854.60 → 2855.14] If you can get them room temperature.
[2855.14 → 2857.14] That's why people are so stoked about that.
[2857.14 → 2859.10] I thought it was just like about making trains go superfast.
[2859.32 → 2859.34] Oh,
[2859.36 → 2859.50] no,
[2859.50 → 2859.58] no,
[2859.58 → 2859.68] no.
[2859.80 → 2859.88] Like,
[2859.98 → 2860.14] yeah,
[2860.16 → 2861.64] but the thing is about if you have superconductors,
[2861.76 → 2863.30] you've got zero resistance,
[2863.46 → 2864.02] zero impedance.
[2864.60 → 2866.20] So you can literally have no engine.
[2867.30 → 2867.62] Yeah.
[2867.70 → 2868.38] You could have everything.
[2868.74 → 2869.08] It's amazing.
[2869.28 → 2871.12] They already have conductors on trains,
[2871.24 → 2871.36] bro.
[2871.64 → 2873.42] And they're super in my book.
[2873.48 → 2873.84] Okay.
[2875.42 → 2875.98] It's just,
[2876.04 → 2876.56] it'd be amazing.
[2876.66 → 2879.00] Like the amount of energy you get from a power station is insane,
[2879.10 → 2880.06] but I'm not doing this joke.
[2880.16 → 2881.30] I'm not playing along teach.
[2882.30 → 2884.08] You made the same face trash.
[2884.08 → 2884.36] Dev.
[2886.50 → 2886.98] Also,
[2887.10 → 2887.54] you're just like,
[2888.12 → 2888.34] huh?
[2888.52 → 2891.34] Like I just watched it just divide by zero for a second.
[2892.96 → 2893.40] All right.
[2893.40 → 2893.56] Teach.
[2893.60 → 2894.18] That was pretty good.
[2894.26 → 2894.76] That was pretty good.
[2894.80 → 2894.98] Okay.
[2895.40 → 2897.88] I literally thought that's the joke you were making.
[2898.00 → 2900.94] I thought you were saying the trains' thing.
[2901.36 → 2903.74] For doing the conductor joke.
[2903.74 → 2903.94] No,
[2903.96 → 2904.12] no,
[2904.12 → 2904.24] no.
[2904.26 → 2907.00] I was just being serious because I thought it was just about like being able to transfer
[2907.00 → 2908.50] things superfast and super easily.
[2909.40 → 2911.56] I thought you were setting me up for it.
[2911.72 → 2911.84] Like,
[2912.22 → 2912.48] yo,
[2912.72 → 2913.12] all right,
[2913.18 → 2914.40] I'm bumping over here.
[2914.48 → 2914.66] Like,
[2914.70 → 2915.78] be ready to spike this.
[2920.28 → 2920.68] Okay.
[2921.16 → 2922.70] So is it really just like,
[2923.84 → 2924.14] okay,
[2924.20 → 2924.46] I'll,
[2924.46 → 2925.88] I'll just put my cards on the table.
[2925.88 → 2931.10] It seems to me like a crazy conspiracy to try and break the internet and be able to get
[2931.10 → 2932.30] back doors and everything.
[2932.48 → 2934.66] That's why people are super interested in it.
[2934.74 → 2935.42] Like I don't,
[2935.50 → 2936.30] that's not the main one,
[2936.34 → 2936.70] but there's like,
[2936.74 → 2937.92] there are loads of other things like good.
[2938.02 → 2939.48] The other one they were talking about is like,
[2939.54 → 2939.72] yeah,
[2939.86 → 2940.90] molecules and such.
[2940.90 → 2941.14] Right.
[2941.26 → 2944.54] So this isn't the exact paper that they're talking about in there.
[2944.62 → 2944.72] The
[2944.72 → 2947.14] the actual paper that Google published at the moment,
[2947.70 → 2948.02] which is,
[2948.36 → 2950.34] I'm going to say the title because it sounds fancy.
[2950.34 → 2950.62] Anyway,
[2951.00 → 2954.34] observation of constructive interference at the edge of quantum periodicity.
[2956.40 → 2958.38] They did use the term ergodic in there.
[2958.50 → 2960.38] And I had to look up what ergodic meant.
[2960.50 → 2961.26] And then when I looked it up,
[2961.30 → 2962.32] I had no idea what it meant.
[2962.42 → 2962.64] It's like,
[2962.64 → 2963.50] it's a fancy word.
[2963.52 → 2964.52] I've never read the definition.
[2964.66 → 2964.98] I was like,
[2965.04 → 2966.16] can't figure that one out.
[2966.72 → 2967.00] Yeah.
[2967.00 → 2968.18] I wouldn't worry too much.
[2968.58 → 2969.10] Hold on.
[2969.48 → 2969.80] For,
[2969.86 → 2970.62] for those that don't know,
[2970.68 → 2971.30] let me just give you,
[2971.40 → 2972.46] let me just give you like a
[2972.46 → 2973.86] just a quickie in this paper.
[2973.96 → 2974.18] Hold on.
[2974.20 → 2974.90] I have it up here,
[2975.20 → 2975.54] right here.
[2975.74 → 2976.24] This is,
[2976.32 → 2977.60] this is the thing with ergodic.
[2977.92 → 2978.16] Uh,
[2978.16 → 2978.86] it goes like this.
[2979.18 → 2980.32] As entanglement grows,
[2980.34 → 2982.12] both with size or a whole,
[2982.24 → 2985.92] as entanglement grows with system size or evolution time,
[2986.28 → 2988.48] the resulting dynamics are often ergodic.
[2988.98 → 2989.54] And I was just like,
[2989.58 → 2991.46] I don't know what that word means.
[2991.50 → 2992.42] I was trying to read the paper.
[2993.00 → 2997.84] And ergodic is relating to or denoting systems or processes with the property
[2997.84 → 3000.20] that given such a sufficient time,
[3000.20 → 3004.40] they include or impinge on all points in a given space and can be represented
[3004.40 → 3007.32] statistically by a reasonably large selection of points.
[3008.32 → 3009.48] That was way too many words.
[3009.48 → 3009.62] Again,
[3009.68 → 3011.54] go back to the drunk man in a field.
[3012.12 → 3013.80] Eventually he'll hit every single point in the field.
[3013.86 → 3014.76] If he doesn't escape it.
[3015.78 → 3016.14] Right?
[3016.60 → 3016.96] Yeah.
[3017.20 → 3017.38] Real.
[3017.70 → 3017.90] Okay.
[3017.98 → 3018.06] Yeah.
[3018.06 → 3019.34] That's another way of explaining that.
[3019.34 → 3019.80] I can follow that one.
[3019.94 → 3020.78] I can follow that one.
[3020.88 → 3021.10] Okay.
[3021.20 → 3021.40] Yeah.
[3021.96 → 3022.32] See,
[3022.46 → 3022.74] see,
[3022.74 → 3025.78] bring it down to the drunk man in the pub level.
[3026.26 → 3027.88] I'm going to start saying that all the time.
[3027.88 → 3028.80] On the entire board.
[3029.06 → 3029.28] Okay.
[3029.44 → 3029.72] Correct.
[3029.92 → 3030.22] Yes.
[3031.04 → 3031.20] Yeah.
[3031.20 → 3031.76] That's what it means.
[3031.82 → 3031.96] Yeah.
[3032.78 → 3033.04] Okay.
[3033.14 → 3033.58] That's all it is.
[3033.58 → 3035.02] And when they say state in this case,
[3035.04 → 3035.52] or a space,
[3035.60 → 3036.12] when they say space,
[3036.16 → 3036.74] they don't mean literal,
[3036.88 → 3037.92] like a space in a field.
[3038.12 → 3039.10] They literally mean like,
[3039.18 → 3039.28] Oh,
[3039.28 → 3040.54] it could be like these three bits.
[3040.80 → 3041.12] Like,
[3041.16 → 3042.22] could it be in all three bits,
[3042.30 → 3043.00] different states of that?
[3043.06 → 3043.96] That's all that means.
[3043.96 → 3047.74] It's like a very abstract conception of what a space is.
[3048.74 → 3049.30] The possible,
[3049.50 → 3051.78] like probability space or the state space.
[3051.78 → 3053.24] I love how you keep saying words.
[3053.40 → 3054.12] And it's just,
[3054.32 → 3056.94] I think I'm like hard coded on my clarity at this point.
[3057.76 → 3058.20] Yeah.
[3058.24 → 3059.42] I'm so used to believing.
[3059.66 → 3059.84] Yeah.
[3059.88 → 3060.56] All these words.
[3060.64 → 3061.84] There are too many words.
[3061.98 → 3062.64] It makes sense.
[3063.76 → 3063.98] Yeah.
[3064.06 → 3064.24] Okay.
[3064.24 → 3065.62] I don't like how he's just like,
[3065.64 → 3066.40] I don't know anything.
[3066.60 → 3068.50] And then he started saying a bunch of smart things.
[3068.62 → 3068.96] I was like,
[3069.44 → 3071.76] I was watching videos too.
[3071.90 → 3072.42] I guy,
[3072.50 → 3073.58] I'm pretty much a quantum expert.
[3073.58 → 3074.86] I like everyone else on Twitter.
[3074.96 → 3078.26] I spent one day researching it and I know everything.
[3078.62 → 3079.10] These are my,
[3079.10 → 3080.36] these are my notes.
[3081.44 → 3084.68] Superposition entanglement can be both values at once.
[3084.82 → 3085.64] Has to be cold.
[3086.04 → 3087.80] Those are like fucking stuff.
[3087.98 → 3089.00] That's a lot.
[3089.00 → 3091.34] That was my summary of everything I learned.
[3091.70 → 3093.12] And then we went far beyond that.
[3093.20 → 3093.36] I was like,
[3093.38 → 3093.50] yeah,
[3093.50 → 3094.86] I can't be in this conversation anymore.
[3095.70 → 3096.12] Trash.
[3096.18 → 3096.96] Those are good notes.
[3097.08 → 3097.46] Honestly,
[3097.84 → 3098.74] it most,
[3098.92 → 3099.28] every,
[3099.48 → 3103.44] like every quantum computing article should start with those because
[3103.44 → 3104.38] even just,
[3104.72 → 3104.80] Hey,
[3104.80 → 3105.54] you're going to have to,
[3105.62 → 3106.44] as far as we can tell,
[3106.52 → 3108.08] keep this at basically zero.
[3108.40 → 3108.90] You're like,
[3109.04 → 3109.34] Oh,
[3109.76 → 3111.54] so not everyone's going to have one in their basement.
[3111.80 → 3112.00] Like,
[3112.04 → 3113.14] it's already like,
[3113.20 → 3114.30] you're just not going to happen.
[3114.42 → 3115.24] At least for a while.
[3115.62 → 3116.60] I'm going to start saying ergodic.
[3117.60 → 3119.06] That's a big learning trash.
[3119.16 → 3119.84] Put that one in too.
[3119.84 → 3121.62] But that is just a fancy word.
[3122.42 → 3125.62] They're just stupid physicists using stupid words is all I'm saying.
[3125.76 → 3126.04] Okay.
[3126.80 → 3127.18] By the way,
[3127.18 → 3130.64] I also brought props today because I actually have got some molecules.
[3130.64 → 3130.84] Oh,
[3130.96 → 3131.38] exactly.
[3131.52 → 3131.66] Yeah.
[3132.10 → 3132.60] I have loads.
[3132.60 → 3132.96] What are those?
[3133.08 → 3133.40] Cubits?
[3133.48 → 3134.02] What you got there?
[3134.54 → 3134.72] Yeah.
[3134.88 → 3134.94] Yeah.
[3134.94 → 3135.18] Right.
[3135.66 → 3135.86] Oh,
[3135.92 → 3136.12] no,
[3136.16 → 3137.04] I've just broken this one.
[3137.12 → 3137.46] Oh no.
[3137.76 → 3138.44] Where do I put that back?
[3138.58 → 3138.72] See,
[3138.90 → 3139.94] if that was science,
[3139.94 → 3140.72] there we go.
[3141.72 → 3142.30] This one,
[3142.52 → 3143.70] I think some people might know this.
[3143.70 → 3144.60] This is just glucose.
[3144.70 → 3145.02] It's sugar.
[3145.22 → 3145.80] That's just sugar.
[3146.22 → 3147.14] I had no idea that was glucose.
[3147.48 → 3147.62] Dude,
[3147.70 → 3147.94] trash.
[3148.02 → 3148.84] You should know that one,
[3148.92 → 3149.00] bro.
[3149.40 → 3150.12] I eat it.
[3150.16 → 3150.80] I consume it.
[3150.88 → 3151.34] I don't know what it's like.
[3151.34 → 3151.98] From this stream,
[3152.06 → 3152.56] it's adrenaline,
[3152.88 → 3153.06] right?
[3153.10 → 3154.00] I'm just making some props.
[3154.80 → 3155.12] Nice.
[3155.12 → 3155.44] Oh,
[3155.44 → 3155.94] nice.
[3156.28 → 3156.74] So there you go.
[3156.74 → 3157.20] There's adrenaline.
[3158.38 → 3158.74] Okay.
[3158.78 → 3164.44] So then explain why do quantum computers matter for seeing the shape of these?
[3164.86 → 3168.20] So a lot of these things is that not those particularly there,
[3168.26 → 3171.34] but we'll say it was something like a protein specifically because a lot of,
[3171.34 → 3171.94] um,
[3171.94 → 3175.50] like medicine is based around figuring out proteins and their shapes of them.
[3175.90 → 3177.98] Because they may know the chemicals like representation,
[3177.98 → 3179.42] but they don't actually know how it's oriented.
[3179.68 → 3183.00] Now I know there's a lot of people doing that with like manually doing this and
[3183.00 → 3183.30] such,
[3183.30 → 3187.00] but if you can get a quantum algorithm to actually just figure it out,
[3187.36 → 3189.28] that's much better.
[3189.80 → 3190.20] Right.
[3190.52 → 3191.08] Weird enough,
[3191.18 → 3193.08] AI is doing a perfect job at the moment of this.
[3193.82 → 3194.18] Um,
[3194.30 → 3194.46] yeah.
[3194.66 → 3195.24] That's one place.
[3195.32 → 3196.28] AI has been perfect at.
[3196.80 → 3197.18] Yeah.
[3197.40 → 3197.58] Yeah.
[3197.58 → 3198.32] Because it's effectively,
[3198.56 → 3198.90] again,
[3199.02 → 3199.74] it's statistical,
[3199.74 → 3202.08] this periodicity thing,
[3202.70 → 3203.32] figuring out all this.
[3203.42 → 3205.98] It's a searching algorithm and quantum stuff is perfect for searching for
[3205.98 → 3206.28] things.
[3206.50 → 3208.08] That's where that the quantum space is all doing.
[3208.12 → 3208.30] It's like,
[3208.32 → 3211.40] it's doing all the different searches around by probability.
[3211.72 → 3214.88] So if you can find the right orientation and like mapping of a certain
[3214.88 → 3215.34] molecule,
[3215.54 → 3216.54] then it helps.
[3216.58 → 3217.02] Like again,
[3217.14 → 3217.48] here's,
[3217.52 → 3218.04] here's adrenaline.
[3218.42 → 3218.60] Look,
[3218.66 → 3219.74] there's a floppy tail here.
[3220.06 → 3221.72] And imagine this was a fancy thing.
[3221.78 → 3223.04] Like sometimes it could be the orientation.
[3223.20 → 3223.26] Like,
[3223.28 → 3223.36] Oh,
[3223.38 → 3226.74] this is the lowest energy level in this orientation rather than this one,
[3226.78 → 3228.86] which is very like high energy or something.
[3229.40 → 3231.22] So you're trying to figure out that makes sense.
[3231.54 → 3231.78] Yeah.
[3232.66 → 3235.04] I'm kind of doing it,
[3235.08 → 3235.68] but I got props.
[3235.78 → 3236.02] Okay.
[3236.34 → 3236.52] Yeah.
[3236.52 → 3237.00] It's just cool.
[3237.00 → 3237.24] Okay.
[3237.24 → 3238.84] So I'll,
[3238.84 → 3240.76] let me just walk it back to make sure I'm understanding.
[3241.36 → 3242.54] We've got molecules.
[3242.74 → 3243.42] They exist.
[3243.62 → 3244.92] We believe in molecules.
[3244.92 → 3248.66] I'm following so far the shape they are actually makes a difference.
[3248.66 → 3251.98] Cause like we do stuff like inhibitors and receptors and all this other
[3251.98 → 3252.44] crazy stuff.
[3252.54 → 3254.38] They got to like match up next to each other,
[3254.38 → 3256.20] like in physical real space.
[3256.20 → 3260.44] Like it actually matters whether it's a curly Q or whether it's a straight
[3260.44 → 3262.54] line for the medicine to work.
[3262.60 → 3265.30] Otherwise it like doesn't block the thing, or it does block the thing.
[3265.30 → 3265.66] Yep.
[3266.20 → 3266.46] Okay.
[3266.56 → 3269.88] So then we're saying we got to figure out what they look like.
[3269.90 → 3271.78] Cause that actually matters for us to try it.
[3271.78 → 3273.34] And we got to try like a lot of different kinds,
[3273.34 → 3276.70] maybe adding one little more little guy here or doing one little guy over
[3276.70 → 3277.52] here or something else.
[3277.86 → 3279.20] It's going to change the shape a lot.
[3279.58 → 3282.62] What's the most likely shape that they're going to be so that they can do
[3282.62 → 3284.30] the medicine thing or whatever.
[3284.56 → 3284.68] Right.
[3285.12 → 3286.00] That's a good answer.
[3286.22 → 3286.48] Okay.
[3286.64 → 3289.50] And so then we're saying we have this huge search problem that
[3289.50 → 3291.74] follows a bunch of probabilistic rules.
[3291.74 → 3296.08] That seems like a good example of where maybe we could find or narrow the
[3296.08 → 3296.86] search space.
[3297.46 → 3299.58] Like in the bouncing ball example,
[3299.58 → 3301.28] which we didn't get to show Casey today,
[3301.28 → 3305.32] but maybe we'll get a separate clip of showing Casey that and just put it
[3305.32 → 3306.44] into the episode right here.
[3306.58 → 3306.98] I don't know.
[3307.42 → 3307.78] They're like,
[3307.84 → 3310.20] this is 13,000 times faster for this random thing.
[3310.28 → 3310.64] So you're saying,
[3310.74 → 3311.02] okay,
[3311.56 → 3313.84] we could search for the shapes of the molecules.
[3314.50 → 3315.56] Like in this example,
[3315.68 → 3320.14] 13,000 times faster than we would with old classical computers.
[3320.14 → 3323.56] So we could test like a lot more different kinds of drugs faster and more
[3323.56 → 3323.92] cheaply.
[3323.92 → 3325.72] And then we could make new medicine.
[3325.94 → 3326.08] Yeah.
[3326.08 → 3326.36] This is,
[3326.42 → 3326.52] yeah,
[3326.52 → 3328.20] this is another pole point of quantum computers.
[3328.32 → 3328.42] Yeah.
[3328.46 → 3329.48] It's one of those where there is like,
[3329.52 → 3332.24] it's effectively most of these are searching algorithms.
[3332.66 → 3333.02] Got it.
[3333.02 → 3333.32] When you think,
[3333.38 → 3335.62] look at all most of the quantum algorithms are all sorts of forms of
[3335.62 → 3336.28] searching algorithms.
[3336.54 → 3336.86] Right.
[3337.96 → 3338.28] Okay.
[3338.28 → 3340.30] So does that mean that the
[3340.40 → 3341.34] you know how there's like the
[3341.60 → 3344.86] I donate my computer to medical science, and it goes, and it does a bunch of
[3344.86 → 3346.20] protein looking and all that.
[3346.46 → 3346.56] Yeah.
[3346.62 → 3348.56] Is that effectively because I mean,
[3348.56 → 3349.92] because even if Willow was a thing,
[3349.98 → 3351.66] it only runs in Larry's basement.
[3352.36 → 3352.76] Therefore,
[3353.48 → 3357.30] the donating your computer to science is still producing an absolute term.
[3357.30 → 3357.58] Yeah.
[3357.94 → 3361.00] Even though it's 13,000 times faster than a supercomputer.
[3361.00 → 3361.54] It's just like,
[3361.58 → 3361.66] well,
[3361.66 → 3362.94] we have a million people doing it.
[3362.98 → 3363.48] So it's like,
[3363.88 → 3366.28] this one always wins because it's just so much easier.
[3366.28 → 3366.34] Yeah.
[3366.34 → 3366.72] At the moment,
[3366.78 → 3367.24] at the moment,
[3367.30 → 3369.06] but the whole point is if you get these bigger,
[3369.48 → 3370.56] faster and everything,
[3370.62 → 3373.08] because that 13,000 times one is they're talking about this specific
[3373.08 → 3373.58] algorithm,
[3374.42 → 3376.32] which I think on their particular paper,
[3376.32 → 3377.92] but in like the articles I was reading,
[3377.92 → 3378.96] not the paper itself,
[3379.00 → 3380.02] they were calling it quantum echoes.
[3380.38 → 3381.48] What it means is they're like,
[3381.56 → 3383.94] it's how fast you can scramble this data,
[3384.02 → 3384.96] then unscramble it.
[3385.46 → 3387.38] That's effectively the algorithm they're talking.
[3387.44 → 3388.00] It's like a scrambling,
[3388.10 → 3389.50] unscrambling that you got eggs,
[3389.56 → 3390.02] you scramble it,
[3390.06 → 3391.46] then you figure out how to unscramble the eggs.
[3392.14 → 3394.18] And then they're,
[3394.18 → 3398.34] they may be able to do it 13,000 times faster than the biggest supercomputer at the
[3398.34 → 3398.52] moment,
[3398.58 → 3398.88] apparently,
[3399.22 → 3400.02] which is impressive.
[3400.80 → 3401.30] Mm-hmm.
[3401.62 → 3402.28] But again,
[3402.28 → 3404.90] it's this very specific algorithm they designed it for.
[3405.84 → 3406.16] Yeah.
[3406.26 → 3407.62] And if you need to change the algorithm,
[3407.76 → 3409.66] you'd have to rehab the chip and everything.
[3409.84 → 3412.38] So there is like limitations in time and change and,
[3412.38 → 3414.06] and unknowns in the problem.
[3414.16 → 3415.14] So every time you hit a roadblock,
[3415.20 → 3415.42] you're like,
[3415.48 → 3415.68] all right,
[3415.70 → 3416.70] back to the classicals,
[3416.70 → 3417.62] because we've got to do a year.
[3417.66 → 3419.96] And I actually wonder what failure rate for those chips are,
[3420.04 → 3423.00] like how many chips they have to be made to make them work.
[3423.56 → 3424.38] Because I know like in Silicon,
[3424.62 → 3425.22] like a lot of chips is bad.
[3425.22 → 3425.26] Well,
[3425.26 → 3426.60] they say statistically in the U S entanglements don't,
[3426.68 → 3426.80] you know,
[3426.80 → 3428.86] like 50% of entanglements end in separation.
[3428.86 → 3429.98] So I'm not sure how,
[3430.10 → 3432.08] how long these chips actually last for.
[3432.32 → 3432.46] Yeah.
[3432.50 → 3432.90] Me neither.
[3433.12 → 3433.30] I mean,
[3433.34 → 3433.66] too much.
[3433.78 → 3435.60] Is that a real statement that you just said?
[3435.74 → 3438.38] One-person relationship goes cold.
[3438.52 → 3438.84] Oh,
[3439.44 → 3439.96] oh,
[3440.12 → 3440.52] okay.
[3440.96 → 3441.62] As soon as he said it,
[3441.64 → 3442.98] I just got so confused.
[3444.46 → 3446.42] My eyes just like widened on that.
[3446.54 → 3446.70] I was like,
[3446.74 → 3448.98] did I miss something?
[3449.10 → 3450.38] Why is it only in the U S?
[3450.44 → 3451.16] This is crazy.
[3452.90 → 3453.10] Dude,
[3453.10 → 3453.90] that's pretty much,
[3453.90 → 3457.52] that's pretty much the plot of the dark forest trilogy.
[3458.86 → 3459.58] Oh,
[3459.94 → 3465.80] it is kind of sad that all my quantum knowledge comes from the dark.
[3465.90 → 3466.76] It comes from that.
[3466.84 → 3467.62] The three body problem.
[3467.84 → 3468.04] Hey,
[3468.10 → 3469.20] that's a good book.
[3469.92 → 3470.52] It's a good book.
[3470.58 → 3470.70] Yeah.
[3470.72 → 3473.26] But is this also like a Christopher Nolan document,
[3473.36 → 3474.64] a documentary or is it real?
[3475.72 → 3476.82] It's also a documentary.
[3476.82 → 3477.54] Which one's weird?
[3477.62 → 3478.22] The book.
[3479.70 → 3479.88] No,
[3479.94 → 3480.40] not the show.
[3480.40 → 3481.18] The show is terrible.
[3481.60 → 3482.14] The show made it.
[3482.14 → 3482.78] I learned.
[3483.14 → 3484.22] I've only seen the show.
[3484.36 → 3484.96] I didn't read the book.
[3485.60 → 3485.84] No,
[3486.00 → 3486.70] I liked the show.
[3486.96 → 3487.84] Because I didn't read the book.
[3487.84 → 3489.80] You have to say that,
[3489.86 → 3490.02] bro.
[3491.16 → 3494.68] The show has to be even more confusing without the book.
[3494.72 → 3495.50] It's like super,
[3495.56 → 3496.20] like I was watching.
[3496.26 → 3496.42] I'm like,
[3496.48 → 3498.20] what the hell is even happening here?
[3498.26 → 3498.52] Anyway.
[3498.58 → 3498.76] Okay.
[3498.76 → 3499.46] We got to get back.
[3499.52 → 3501.14] We got to get back on topic here.
[3501.14 → 3501.94] We can't be talking about that.
[3502.02 → 3502.52] That show.
[3504.36 → 3505.76] I don't even know what the topic should be.
[3506.48 → 3507.06] I was like,
[3507.06 → 3508.32] so where do we go from this?
[3509.72 → 3510.08] Okay.
[3510.32 → 3510.90] I've got,
[3511.08 → 3511.36] uh,
[3511.36 → 3512.34] I'll do another one then.
[3512.34 → 3512.78] Um,
[3513.30 → 3516.84] what are the odds that we have a
[3517.56 → 3518.02] like,
[3518.06 → 3520.34] or maybe a better answer or a question would be,
[3520.42 → 3522.30] what is the timeline you expect?
[3522.30 → 3525.34] Cause so what I found very funny is Google is like,
[3525.34 → 3526.16] bro,
[3526.16 → 3530.14] this is the first time anyone's ever even done anything with a quantum computer.
[3530.14 → 3530.58] Yeah.
[3530.58 → 3531.68] That's like what they said.
[3531.78 → 3532.64] I felt like it was like,
[3532.68 → 3535.72] this is the first time anything's ever been done.
[3535.72 → 3542.12] And it's way faster than a classical computer at solving this thing that only quantum computers would care about,
[3542.26 → 3542.82] which I was like,
[3542.84 → 3543.14] okay,
[3543.24 → 3543.58] sure.
[3543.66 → 3544.12] Fair enough.
[3544.76 → 3545.08] Um,
[3545.24 → 3545.84] so like,
[3545.86 → 3546.50] let's say,
[3547.16 → 3547.50] I mean,
[3547.52 → 3553.78] they may throw a billion dollars at something to make it help them find a particular drug.
[3553.78 → 3553.94] So,
[3554.02 → 3554.54] but that does,
[3554.68 → 3554.80] I,
[3554.94 → 3555.40] in my mind,
[3555.40 → 3556.28] that doesn't really count.
[3556.28 → 3562.86] That's just like saying we spent a bunch more money on something to do what we could have done with regular computers.
[3562.86 → 3563.94] Like imagine how many,
[3564.08 → 3567.86] how many AWS lambdas you could rent for a billion dollars,
[3567.98 → 3568.14] right.
[3568.16 → 3568.82] To run your thing.
[3569.00 → 3569.62] So like,
[3569.70 → 3575.32] where do you have any guess or any feeling of when like a commercial application,
[3575.44 → 3576.54] not a research project,
[3576.58 → 3577.90] like a commercial application is like,
[3578.00 → 3578.10] Oh,
[3578.10 → 3581.02] we rented our Google's willow chip for a week.
[3581.02 → 3586.10] So we could run drug tests, and it was cheaper for us than the equivalent,
[3586.20 → 3586.74] you know,
[3586.80 → 3587.70] classical computer.
[3587.90 → 3588.50] Is there like a time?
[3588.50 → 3588.98] Could you even rent it out?
[3589.28 → 3589.68] Right.
[3589.76 → 3590.62] Because wouldn't that be the problem?
[3590.62 → 3593.92] Every drug test would have to be like unique and bespoke and hand.
[3594.00 → 3596.28] They have some stuff to run some,
[3596.28 → 3599.66] like some amount of reprogrammability onto the chips,
[3599.72 → 3599.88] I think,
[3599.88 → 3601.00] but it's not like a
[3601.38 → 3602.98] you can't write like a for loop.
[3603.04 → 3606.14] You're putting like the gates and connecting them, and they probably have some stuff.
[3606.20 → 3609.42] So I think it's not literally full rehab every single time.
[3610.80 → 3611.44] But I don't,
[3611.56 → 3614.54] I have no idea on the timeframe is all I can say is that's,
[3614.54 → 3614.82] that's,
[3614.86 → 3615.40] that's my answer.
[3615.50 → 3616.18] I have no idea.
[3616.78 → 3617.00] Okay.
[3617.00 → 3619.52] I was in an interesting talk in 2010,
[3619.52 → 3621.38] which was like the
[3621.38 → 3623.56] the future of quantum computing.
[3624.06 → 3625.72] And it was at MSU.
[3625.72 → 3627.62] And he was talking about by 2025,
[3627.62 → 3631.38] the government was saying that you should be like more quantum secure.
[3632.06 → 3633.26] And by 2028,
[3633.26 → 3634.12] you should be like,
[3634.38 → 3637.66] you should not have any SAS left was kind of the timeframe.
[3637.66 → 3641.82] And so now we're kind of arriving to this time when it's looking like things are actually kind of falling into place where,
[3641.82 → 3642.30] yeah,
[3642.30 → 3643.26] maybe in three to five years,
[3643.32 → 3644.04] something could be,
[3644.16 → 3644.42] you know,
[3644.68 → 3645.70] they could start hacking,
[3645.88 → 3646.14] you know,
[3646.20 → 3647.98] maybe only like one K RSA,
[3648.08 → 3648.90] even though we're at four K,
[3648.96 → 3649.34] but that's not,
[3649.42 → 3652.26] that's only going to take an extra couple of bits before we're at the next level.
[3652.52 → 3653.34] And so I was,
[3653.38 → 3654.30] I was very curious.
[3655.86 → 3656.22] If,
[3656.44 → 3658.10] if you believe in his hypothesis,
[3658.10 → 3659.44] which the guy standing there was,
[3659.52 → 3660.86] he made a really great hypothesis,
[3660.86 → 3663.64] which was if the government tells you by this time,
[3663.68 → 3664.44] you should be secure.
[3664.72 → 3666.88] The government already has that technology.
[3667.56 → 3669.58] And it's just like a way ahead of the curve.
[3669.58 → 3674.26] Do you think that the government actually has good quantum technology at this point?
[3674.32 → 3674.80] It's just not,
[3674.96 → 3675.24] you know,
[3675.28 → 3677.94] releasing Area 51 space lasers and shit,
[3678.04 → 3679.14] or is it just like,
[3679.20 → 3679.96] or is this all fake?
[3682.70 → 3683.58] That's a good question.
[3683.62 → 3683.90] Actually.
[3684.50 → 3684.72] Yeah.
[3685.00 → 3688.88] Sometimes the government has technology before the public does a long time before.
[3689.60 → 3689.76] Yeah.
[3690.10 → 3691.12] But the question is,
[3691.14 → 3691.32] is,
[3691.46 → 3692.34] do they have this?
[3692.46 → 3692.78] And I,
[3693.82 → 3696.16] sometimes the government also just has like random advice,
[3696.16 → 3697.70] which is like pulled out of nowhere.
[3697.70 → 3698.70] Um,
[3699.46 → 3700.50] like they sometimes do this,
[3700.56 → 3701.18] like just sell it.
[3701.26 → 3701.28] Oh,
[3701.28 → 3702.16] we'll make sure up to date.
[3702.22 → 3702.32] Like,
[3702.36 → 3702.44] yeah,
[3702.46 → 3704.04] make sure it's by 2028 guys.
[3706.14 → 3706.88] I don't know.
[3706.96 → 3707.28] It's like,
[3707.30 → 3708.22] they're still running COBOL.
[3708.30 → 3709.34] Make sure you're up-to-date everybody.
[3710.48 → 3710.80] Yeah.
[3711.90 → 3713.78] But they might do.
[3713.90 → 3714.74] This is the thing.
[3714.98 → 3715.74] If they do,
[3715.86 → 3716.74] we aren't going to know.
[3716.88 → 3717.88] And if I did know,
[3717.94 → 3718.90] I wouldn't be able to say anyway,
[3718.92 → 3720.66] because I'd be probably under the official secrets act.
[3721.28 → 3721.64] So,
[3721.76 → 3723.74] which I have already signed before for a previous job,
[3723.74 → 3724.20] but like,
[3724.34 → 3724.56] yeah.
[3725.62 → 3725.90] Yeah.
[3725.90 → 3729.26] Ginger pill confirms government conspiracy online.net right now.
[3729.74 → 3731.96] Secret secrets are no fun.
[3732.12 → 3732.92] If I knew,
[3733.58 → 3733.78] I,
[3733.88 → 3735.38] I probably won't be able to tell you.
[3735.90 → 3736.86] And if I did,
[3737.06 → 3737.58] didn't know,
[3737.70 → 3738.84] I still got a great point.
[3739.00 → 3740.38] I got to put my tinfoil hat on.
[3740.48 → 3741.12] We all need tinfoil hats.
[3741.78 → 3744.26] You're helping us understand quantum computers right now.
[3744.26 → 3744.62] Exactly.
[3745.02 → 3745.66] You know,
[3745.70 → 3746.52] here's how you measure it.
[3746.64 → 3748.36] Like there might be an actual state of me knowing.
[3748.80 → 3750.60] It's just you're knowing of it is,
[3750.92 → 3750.94] uh,
[3750.94 → 3753.10] you've only got a probabilistic under knowing of it.
[3753.10 → 3753.42] That's it.
[3753.48 → 3753.72] That's it.
[3753.80 → 3754.26] That's it.
[3754.26 → 3757.26] I got an ergodic keyboard right here.
[3759.66 → 3760.42] That's my manager.
[3760.52 → 3761.52] Can I buy some ergodic,
[3761.52 → 3761.80] uh,
[3761.80 → 3762.50] office furniture?
[3763.50 → 3763.88] Trash,
[3763.96 → 3764.86] trash then.
[3765.32 → 3765.78] He's like,
[3765.80 → 3766.02] I want,
[3766.12 → 3767.70] I need some ergodic supplies.
[3767.90 → 3768.38] The manager says,
[3768.46 → 3768.76] okay.
[3769.12 → 3771.60] Trash orders a bunch of alcohol and goes,
[3771.70 → 3773.16] gets drunk in the field.
[3773.48 → 3775.14] Just walk around in my backyard.
[3775.88 → 3777.12] That's a way to learn physics.
[3777.12 → 3778.52] You're going to get so ergodic right now.
[3778.52 → 3779.36] This is,
[3779.48 → 3779.66] bro,
[3779.84 → 3781.68] you want to get ergodic this weekend?
[3781.68 → 3785.44] I'm impinging all the points in a given space.
[3787.40 → 3787.96] All right.
[3788.64 → 3789.52] I don't have any other questions.
[3789.52 → 3790.60] We need to know about quantum.
[3790.72 → 3792.02] I would just like to say that I,
[3792.04 → 3793.60] I left with some new knowledge.
[3794.28 → 3794.68] Oh,
[3794.84 → 3797.30] but I mostly left with the same questions I've always had.
[3798.68 → 3799.08] Yeah.
[3800.08 → 3800.44] Okay.
[3800.88 → 3801.22] So this,
[3801.30 → 3802.40] this technology really,
[3802.52 → 3805.36] because we never even got to like the fact that there's people that are
[3805.36 → 3806.02] throwing out terms.
[3806.10 → 3806.92] I've seen this happen,
[3806.92 → 3808.20] especially with like a lot of the clickbait.
[3808.26 → 3811.06] Like I'm going to trick my uncle into believing something videos,
[3811.06 → 3811.86] which is just like,
[3811.90 → 3815.52] just wait until the quantum AI revolution happens.
[3815.52 → 3815.94] Is that,
[3816.08 → 3819.28] I assume that's not a real thing in any sort of capacity.
[3819.52 → 3819.92] No.
[3820.04 → 3822.84] And that everything they're saying is just words that are too,
[3822.98 → 3825.18] I just assume they're just two words next to each other.
[3825.18 → 3826.14] That sound very fancy,
[3826.14 → 3828.36] but have no actual value or meaning.
[3828.36 → 3829.12] Okay.
[3829.76 → 3830.90] It does seem like,
[3830.98 → 3834.24] if you ever hear the word quantum talking about anybody who's not a
[3834.24 → 3834.50] physicist,
[3835.28 → 3836.96] just assume they're bullshitting you.
[3837.30 → 3837.70] Hmm.
[3837.96 → 3838.14] Okay.
[3838.24 → 3838.90] Pretty much always.
[3839.36 → 3839.54] Right.
[3839.70 → 3841.22] Do you think ginger bill though,
[3841.22 → 3845.86] since AI is like a big matrix multiplication thing of,
[3846.10 → 3846.44] you know,
[3847.16 → 3849.24] probability distributions like that,
[3849.28 → 3852.94] there could be potentially like someday AI,
[3853.10 → 3854.26] like a quantum AI.
[3854.26 → 3856.98] Maybe they would do that in the day,
[3857.08 → 3857.36] but I mean,
[3857.36 → 3858.70] anytime soon at the moment,
[3858.80 → 3859.52] assume it's right.
[3859.62 → 3859.98] Yes.
[3860.50 → 3860.68] Yeah.
[3860.68 → 3861.26] That makes sense.
[3861.34 → 3861.86] That makes sense.
[3861.88 → 3862.06] TJ,
[3862.16 → 3865.54] is it really just probability distributions or hear me out?
[3865.58 → 3868.32] Is it just a really confusing compression algorithm?
[3869.16 → 3869.94] Which one?
[3870.70 → 3871.04] AI.
[3872.62 → 3873.10] Yes.
[3873.54 → 3874.74] It's very lossy compression.
[3874.74 → 3877.32] I think it's a very lossy compression algorithm, actually.
[3877.86 → 3879.10] I think AI is,
[3879.44 → 3882.42] I would say it's more of a
[3883.00 → 3886.68] it maps ideas into higher dimensional spaces.
[3886.68 → 3889.70] And then it points in certain directions towards those things,
[3889.70 → 3892.92] which that's why it makes me feel more like quantum stuff.
[3892.92 → 3894.68] Because it also has a state vector.
[3894.68 → 3896.12] Like,
[3896.22 → 3898.50] and that's why words get associated with each other.
[3898.50 → 3900.80] Because they're near each other in the same space.
[3901.70 → 3904.76] But I don't work at open AI.
[3905.22 → 3910.12] So Sam Altman hasn't told me if we've achieved AGI internally or not.
[3910.12 → 3912.64] I'm just doing this for the love of the game.
[3912.78 → 3913.24] He'll tell you,
[3913.30 → 3913.64] don't worry.
[3913.76 → 3915.08] You can get sort of video directly.
[3915.22 → 3916.06] I'm saying that already.
[3916.50 → 3916.90] Yeah,
[3916.90 → 3917.18] true.
[3917.74 → 3918.14] Yes.
[3918.88 → 3919.24] All right.
[3919.28 → 3919.54] Well,
[3919.92 → 3920.84] I guess,
[3921.04 → 3924.40] I guess I'll have to tell my uncle about quantum AI being a lie.
[3927.42 → 3928.18] Which by the way,
[3928.20 → 3929.30] is how I heard about all this.
[3929.34 → 3929.66] Just like,
[3929.74 → 3929.84] dude,
[3929.90 → 3932.32] what the hell is all this quantum AI business?
[3932.50 → 3932.70] And I'm like,
[3932.78 → 3933.08] brother,
[3933.12 → 3933.90] I don't understand those.
[3933.94 → 3935.22] I'll call my individually.
[3935.22 → 3936.02] I struggle with,
[3936.08 → 3936.94] let alone together.
[3937.82 → 3940.84] I'll call my closest thing to a quantum physicist friend.
[3940.84 → 3942.62] And we'll work on this together.
[3945.74 → 3947.84] Thank you for answering the age-old Facebook question.
[3947.96 → 3948.12] So,
[3948.14 → 3949.14] that should really help.
[3949.48 → 3951.98] I'll report back on my mom's wall right now.
[3952.32 → 3952.56] Mom,
[3952.62 → 3953.62] we don't have to worry.
[3957.04 → 3958.54] I forgot they called it a wall.
[3959.70 → 3960.72] That's a good poll.
[3960.84 → 3961.96] I don't even think I could have done that.
[3963.24 → 3964.80] I've not been on Facebook in over a decade,
[3964.96 → 3965.74] but do you still have to like,
[3965.78 → 3968.72] people say that what their status is and such like that anymore?
[3969.36 → 3969.86] Or no?
[3969.86 → 3971.08] People still use that thing.
[3971.14 → 3971.48] I don't.
[3971.68 → 3973.10] I'm logging into Facebook right now.
[3973.24 → 3975.12] I'm going to say on,
[3975.30 → 3975.92] whoops,
[3976.20 → 3977.24] on a podcast.
[3978.04 → 3979.08] I did try it.
[3979.16 → 3979.90] I did try.
[3980.00 → 3981.32] Like I logged back into Facebook.
[3981.32 → 3983.52] Because I just got so curious just to like,
[3983.58 → 3984.08] see it does.
[3984.12 → 3984.88] It still exists.
[3985.04 → 3988.68] And I went back there, and I realized the old things that I set myself up as
[3988.68 → 3991.74] are still like what I'm defined as on Facebook.
[3992.02 → 3992.24] Oh,
[3992.40 → 3995.00] so it says I'm in a domestic partnership with my wife.
[3995.82 → 3996.22] And,
[3996.32 → 3997.16] uh,
[3997.16 → 3997.68] what's it called?
[3997.92 → 3999.12] And I'm still,
[3999.26 → 4001.42] I'm still a rocket scientist at Jesus.
[4001.94 → 4002.22] Nice.
[4002.28 → 4004.98] Jesus incorporated is where I work as a rocket scientist.
[4005.10 → 4005.44] Here you go,
[4005.48 → 4005.76] guys.
[4006.76 → 4007.44] On a podcast.
[4007.60 → 4008.22] On a podcast.
[4008.42 → 4008.70] Like.
[4009.14 → 4009.38] Oh,
[4009.44 → 4009.56] right.
[4009.62 → 4010.50] You can still do it.
[4010.98 → 4011.38] Wow.
[4011.38 → 4012.62] Okay.
[4013.38 → 4014.84] Dangerous game pulling up your,
[4014.84 → 4015.50] your Facebook.
[4016.00 → 4017.60] I was pretty sure it was fine.
[4019.22 → 4019.70] Fine.
[4020.76 → 4021.24] Wow.
[4021.32 → 4021.60] Okay.
[4021.72 → 4024.88] I don't have anything on there that is cancellable.
[4024.88 → 4029.42] I've got lots of embarrassing posts from me and my then girlfriend,
[4029.60 → 4030.90] now wife from high school.
[4031.44 → 4031.88] Oh,
[4031.96 → 4033.26] I miss you so much.
[4033.98 → 4034.86] 4 PM.
[4034.86 → 4035.44] Like we've been,
[4035.58 → 4036.76] haven't seen each other in an hour.
[4036.86 → 4038.24] Have to post it on each other's walls.
[4038.24 → 4040.82] I haven't seen each other since your high school math class together.
[4041.02 → 4041.94] Just an hour earlier.
[4042.24 → 4042.68] Yes.
[4042.92 → 4045.86] So I'm in sports class right now.
[4045.90 → 4048.12] I just really spiked a volleyball thought about you.
[4048.76 → 4049.48] It's tough.
[4049.56 → 4051.10] It is painful to read.
[4051.20 → 4054.78] I did download my Facebook export a while ago and just poked around.
[4054.88 → 4055.38] Inside.
[4057.06 → 4057.62] What is it?
[4057.64 → 4058.92] Just like a great blog.
[4059.80 → 4061.30] You can download everything,
[4061.56 → 4061.80] trash,
[4061.92 → 4062.28] everything,
[4062.38 → 4063.16] all your DMS,
[4063.26 → 4063.68] all your posts,
[4063.82 → 4064.20] everything.
[4064.84 → 4065.90] And let me tell you,
[4065.94 → 4067.48] you do not want to do that trash.
[4067.56 → 4071.18] You are going to be the biggest loser of all time.
[4071.18 → 4072.52] I want to take that.
[4072.66 → 4074.86] And then I want to do a little fine-tuning.
[4077.62 → 4078.90] Prime 10 years ago.
[4081.68 → 4083.48] Teen prime GPT.
[4085.54 → 4086.18] Prime book.
[4086.96 → 4087.58] Prime book.
[4088.18 → 4088.32] Yeah.
[4088.40 → 4088.66] Okay.
[4088.72 → 4089.00] Well,
[4089.00 → 4089.30] this was,
[4089.44 → 4090.92] this has been absolutely fantastical.
[4091.00 → 4091.72] So thank you very much,
[4091.80 → 4092.42] Bill,
[4092.48 → 4093.12] for being on here.
[4093.46 → 4093.90] You know,
[4093.98 → 4097.60] I would say that the biggest takeaway hopefully everybody has is that all
[4097.60 → 4101.26] those posts and articles that you see all the time are just a bunch of,
[4101.26 → 4101.66] uh,
[4102.30 → 4105.22] probably just a bunch of hogwash for at least the next decade is what it
[4105.22 → 4105.68] sounds like.
[4105.98 → 4106.44] You never know.
[4106.50 → 4108.94] Maybe there'll be some amazing breakthrough that will change the entire
[4108.94 → 4109.64] field completely.
[4109.64 → 4111.12] But if the field is just iterations,
[4111.36 → 4112.88] we're just going to be,
[4113.00 → 4113.18] uh,
[4113.18 → 4115.78] we're going to be waiting a long time until we see anything fantastic.
[4116.02 → 4118.20] Thank you everybody for being a part of the standup ginger bill.
[4118.28 → 4118.82] As always,
[4118.88 → 4119.98] you are fantastic.
[4120.52 → 4123.20] Ginger bill made Odin because C sucks.
[4123.34 → 4125.40] Check out Odin Lang.org.
[4125.86 → 4126.18] Yeah,
[4126.18 → 4126.44] that's it.
[4126.50 → 4126.84] That's it.
[4126.94 → 4127.26] Dot org.
[4127.36 → 4127.50] Okay,
[4127.54 → 4127.70] good.
[4127.76 → 4128.66] That was like a Ron Burgundy.
[4129.04 → 4131.54] I couldn't remember if it's dot com or dot org.
[4131.92 → 4133.68] I'm Charles Barkley.
[4133.68 → 4137.10] I'm Charles Barkley, and I'm an asshole.
[4137.18 → 4137.70] What does he say?
[4137.86 → 4138.10] I mean,
[4138.16 → 4139.52] dot com works apparently as well.
[4139.80 → 4140.26] So yeah,
[4140.32 → 4141.40] dot org or dot com doesn't matter.
[4141.94 → 4142.10] Oh,
[4142.14 → 4142.30] nice.
[4142.30 → 4143.20] You got both of them.
[4143.58 → 4143.70] Okay.
[4144.46 → 4144.76] Nice.
[4145.10 → 4145.34] Uh,
[4145.34 → 4146.76] and then of course we have Teen.
[4146.80 → 4148.20] I don't know if you know who Teen is,
[4148.28 → 4150.74] but he produces courses for boot.dev,
[4150.88 → 4152.90] boot.dev slash Teen.
[4152.98 → 4153.24] Correct.
[4153.76 → 4156.78] I would use promo code BTW for both of us.
[4157.00 → 4157.12] Well,
[4157.14 → 4157.80] I was going to get there.
[4157.86 → 4159.02] I was going to get M.
[4159.06 → 4159.60] Night Shaman.
[4160.32 → 4160.68] Oh,
[4160.80 → 4161.46] with a twist.
[4161.72 → 4161.86] Yeah.
[4162.70 → 4163.02] Uh,
[4163.08 → 4163.42] all right.
[4163.42 → 4164.10] I am prime.
[4164.20 → 4164.50] Of course,
[4164.56 → 4166.00] I'm just going to order the boxes.
[4166.12 → 4166.42] I see.
[4166.66 → 4167.22] I am prime.
[4167.36 → 4169.02] I also have courses on boot.dev,
[4169.08 → 4170.06] boot.dev slash prime.
[4170.12 → 4171.52] But if you like Teen and I equally,
[4171.62 → 4174.74] you can do boot.dev slash by the way for 25% off.
[4174.82 → 4176.36] And both Teen and I will get paid.
[4176.74 → 4177.02] Lastly,
[4177.02 → 4178.58] we have with us trash dev,
[4178.96 → 4179.46] trash dev.
[4179.46 → 4182.00] I don't have anything I can promote of you other than your Twitter.
[4182.12 → 4185.96] Go check out trash his Twitter where he will promote anything and everything.
[4186.12 → 4188.02] So just slide a DM and be like,
[4188.06 → 4188.16] Hey,
[4188.24 → 4188.94] currency.
[4189.62 → 4190.06] I'm a cheap,
[4190.06 → 4190.62] I'm a cheap,
[4190.62 → 4191.46] he'll sell that.
[4191.98 → 4193.38] He works for summer.
[4193.42 → 4194.02] It's buddy.
[4194.40 → 4195.44] Send him some summer.
[4195.56 → 4197.36] I'm seeking a food sponsorship.
[4197.52 → 4197.56] Like,
[4197.64 → 4197.94] seriously,
[4198.08 → 4199.60] I think that's my next calling.
[4199.86 → 4200.36] Not even kidding.
[4200.52 → 4205.32] I will let you have a food sponsorship on this,
[4205.42 → 4205.86] uh,
[4205.86 → 4206.98] on this podcast.
[4207.28 → 4209.88] Ad infinitum with no money attempted to grab into it.
[4209.90 → 4210.90] If you can bring it your own,
[4211.28 → 4212.02] completely separate,
[4212.10 → 4213.08] bring your own sponsor.
[4213.30 → 4214.30] Beat BYOS.
[4214.96 → 4218.04] Make sure it's human food sponsorship as well.
[4218.08 → 4218.46] Okay.
[4219.36 → 4219.68] No,
[4219.68 → 4219.88] uh,
[4219.88 → 4221.02] no bully sticks and stuff.
[4221.12 → 4222.02] No bully sticks.
[4222.02 → 4222.50] Exactly.
[4222.50 → 4226.70] I don't think that intro made it onto the recording.
[4226.86 → 4227.72] So they're not going to,
[4227.82 → 4229.26] they're not going to know why that's a joke.
[4229.38 → 4229.76] It's great.
[4230.36 → 4230.50] Yeah.
[4230.56 → 4231.12] They're just going to hear that.
[4231.18 → 4231.32] I'll be like,
[4231.32 → 4232.12] all right.
[4232.28 → 4233.72] Thank you very much for joining us.
[4233.80 → 4234.88] This is the standup.
[4235.24 → 4235.92] Bye everybody.
[4235.92 → 4237.50] Move up today.
[4239.24 → 4242.40] Vibe called errors on my screen.
[4243.76 → 4245.24] Terminal coffee.
[4246.30 → 4247.52] And help.
[4248.24 → 4250.18] Live in the dream.
