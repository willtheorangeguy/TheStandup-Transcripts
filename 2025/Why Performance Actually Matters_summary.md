• Personal anecdotes about experiencing online chat rooms and relationships as children
• The speaker and their friends were catfished by an adult on a Dragon Ball Z chat room when they were 16 years old.
• The person had obtained the speaker's phone number from the internet and called them, causing panic and distress.
• The speaker and their friends learned a hard lesson about online interactions and safety after this incident.
• This conversation is part of a podcast discussion on performance.
• Habits in high school, including playing video games for long hours and sleeping through classes
• The speaker's mom had prophetic dreams as a child, one of which predicted the internet and global connectivity
• Another dream predicted the end of the world, with people rushing to something, but the specifics are unclear
• The speaker's mom also experienced a bizarre dream where the world was covered in silver bands allowing instant travel

• Possibility of inviting wife on the podcast to share stories about TJ in high school
• Dial-up sound likened to Skrillex music
• Inspiration for music from dial-up experience
• Discussion of performance issues in software and hardware
• Criticism of layering and inefficiency in modern software development
• Argument that complexity has not increased, but rather layers of abstraction have hindered performance
• Proposal to simplify and optimize software architecture
• Software is artificially complicated due to layering unnecessary complexity on top of simple systems
• Many modern technologies, such as Docker containers and interpreted languages, are not necessary for performance or stability
• The focus on convenience and ease of development has led to a lack of concern for efficiency and resource usage
• This artificial complication has resulted in slow software that wastes resources and contributes to e-waste
• Corporate environments often prioritize speed over efficiency, leading to the propagation of complex systems.
• The speaker believes many software issues can be attributed to a lack of performance care and standardization.
• They argue that most people are not at fault, but rather the platform or standards they work with.
• Standard bodies like W3C have failed to prioritize performance, leading to suboptimal solutions.
• Management needs to take responsibility for prioritizing speed and low system resource usage.
• Engineers should be complaining about slow performance to drive change.
• The core issue lies in the underlying substrate (e.g., React) that is not optimized for performance.
• Addressing this requires a shift in mentality, where everyone involved takes care of performance issues.
• The speaker notes that they've never seen a case where performance optimization doesn't correlate with increased user retention.
• A past experience involved optimizing a game on PlayStation to make it seem instant, but users were skeptical due to their prior experiences with slowness.
• This experience highlights how pervasive the problem of user expectations being shaped by prior experiences is.
• The speaker notes that internal politics and performance can be disconnected from consumer-facing performance expectations.
• Most bottlenecks in software are typically found on the server side rather than UI or JavaScript, with rare exceptions.
• There has been an increase in pushing for better performance, partly due to the echo chamber effect of Twitter and passionate individuals sharing their experiences.
• Recent developments like Node and Bun show that there is still room for improvement in performance, even among established technologies.
• Cell 6 was a notorious example of prioritizing video trailers over user experience at Netflix.
• The company once prevented users from accessing the app until a trailer finished downloading.
• Management concluded that performance did not matter due to long loading times on TV.
• A test showed that reducing memory usage by turning off predictive play delay led to increased revenue and user satisfaction.
• There's a difference between an out-of-app spinner (tolerance for longer wait times) and in-app spinner (expectation of no loading).
• The speed at which users can access content affects their behavior, with too much speed leading to skipping over recommended content.
• Supermarkets and retail stores often display less desirable items at eye level to encourage browsing
• Performance improvement can greatly enhance user enjoyment, but may not always be a design priority
• There is a fine line between making an app too engaging vs. focusing on core functionality
• Map apps with poor performance are frustrating and hinder the overall user experience
• Consumers value performance and would rather have a new phone with better specs than just improved camera quality
• The market is indicating that performance matters, but the industry's focus on new features over optimization creates unnecessary e-waste.
• The concept of "hardware catching up" and its limitations
• The issue of latency and round trips to cloud servers for calculations
• The argument that engineers build complex experiences without optimizing for performance
• The idea that software can be written faster than hardware can improve, leading to poor user experiences
• Examples of outdated graphics and physics simulations in modern applications
• The concept of single-threaded code acceleration and its limitations
• The myth that hardware is twice as fast every 18 months
• Single-threaded code performance has plateaued
• Hardware designers struggle to achieve performance increases through shrinking process sizes
• JavaScript is capped out for single-threaded performance gains due to lack of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimization in most code
• Not all users upgrade to new hardware, so developers must balance performance with compatibility concerns
• Perception and affordability can be major barriers to adoption of new technology, including software
• Difficulty with software fluency and performance
• Impact of Silicon Valley bubble on understanding average user experiences
• Differences between GPU and CPU processing
• Importance of performance experts in developing substrates for development
• Need for default parallelization and optimization in web development
• Making performance optimization automatic by default
• Importance of considering performance at the lowest level (substrate) and propagating it upwards
• Reducing performance issues from one hundredth to half-speed would greatly improve responsiveness
• Need for a shift in mentality from "ship as fast as possible" to caring about performance and quality
• Desire for people to care more about their craft and put effort into optimizing performance.
• Performance expectations on Twitter
• Slowness of certain features, such as mentions
• Normalization of poor performance as "normal"
• User apathy and lack of expectation for improvement
• Comparison to other platforms' performance
