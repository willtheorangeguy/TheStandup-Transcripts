[0.00 --> 7.28]  I'm gonna tell the greatest story ever to Casey, and he is gonna he is going to be the happiest person after hearing this
[12.00 --> 18.96]  Uh, anyways, I'm sorry now this all started because Casey was explaining a build process he made for rad, right?
[18.96 --> 25.74]  Am I correct on that for rad game tools and it was a it was terrible and it ruined and they're still using it to this day
[25.74 --> 31.88]  And it's still awful. He recreated pre processor macros, but with a build system is what it sounded like to me
[31.88 --> 36.78]  It's just like hey, we're gonna do imports but with with with comments
[36.78 --> 46.36]  Whatever you're imagining right now. It was worse, right? Whatever whatever the worst build system is you can imagine
[46.36 --> 48.46]  I paid one that was worse
[48.46 --> 52.38]  So I we've had I and I've experienced some pretty bad build system
[52.38 --> 55.50]  So that's that's something to be said right there, but I've never experienced it in the sea world
[55.50 --> 60.06]  So this has to be a new a new level of magic. Yeah, it was pretty great magic. I'm sorry
[60.06 --> 60.62]  All right
[60.62 --> 61.74]  All right, yes
[61.74 --> 62.94]  Garfield big garfield
[62.94 --> 69.26]  So anyways, this reminded us of the story of tom now you may not be familiar with this casey, but tom i'm not
[69.98 --> 72.54]  He's a genius and we're talking about
[73.18 --> 77.90]  Super level pro like protege level super genius
[77.90 --> 83.02]  Okay, this guy is the smartest man in the room in any room. He's in and who is this?
[83.02 --> 86.62]  How do you know this tom or oh, we're gonna get there casey, okay?
[86.94 --> 88.86]  Lore has been written about tom, okay?
[88.86 --> 94.54]  That's all you know is that there's stories on stories on stories about tom being a super genius
[96.06 --> 99.98]  All right, but the story i'm really gonna tell is actually about a about a kid named jake
[99.98 --> 106.06]  And he's not a genius like it by all accounts people would not consider jake a genius
[106.78 --> 108.30]  But this is jake's run-in
[108.78 --> 109.34]  with tom
[109.98 --> 111.26]  the literal genius
[112.06 --> 112.30]  Now
[113.26 --> 120.46]  Obviously jake if you're not familiar jake just got a job and he got a job working on some brand new technologies and he was very excited
[120.46 --> 125.10]  He was young. He was an intern. It's at an unnamed company. So we don't get to know those details
[125.10 --> 127.10]  But it's with node
[127.10 --> 132.22]  json the web we're talking about some cutting-edge stuff back in the early, you know
[132.22 --> 138.94]  20 tens, okay people were excited. I can see tj over there already doing the give me a deal. Okay, he was oh, yeah
[138.94 --> 143.82]  You got you got javascript running on the server. My venture capital wallets are burning
[143.82 --> 145.26]  Exactly
[145.26 --> 148.22]  So on on on his first day
[148.22 --> 153.34]  He was talking with one of the non-technical members kind of getting set up and at the very end of the
[153.34 --> 158.70]  Conversation after explaining how excited he is they made a really odd comment, which was said uh, well
[159.18 --> 162.38]  You know the good news is everything we do is built on svn
[163.10 --> 165.98]  It's gonna be great. You're gonna love it. And so he's like, oh, okay
[167.26 --> 170.14]  Sure, I don't I don't really know what that means but whatever for those by the way
[170.38 --> 172.62]  I know I have a lot of zoomers in chat svn
[173.34 --> 178.70]  Is like a predecessor to get is probably the easiest way to explain it. I don't want to go into any more details
[179.34 --> 182.14]  This is so super virgin nix users
[182.14 --> 184.86]  It's super virgin nix users
[184.86 --> 187.10]  All right
[187.10 --> 191.42]  Well, so let's go into part one. Are you ready for this one?
[191.82 --> 199.58]  json based domain specific language so he gets thrust into a project and the project uses something called j diesel
[199.58 --> 202.30]  His boss says don't worry take the next couple weeks
[202.30 --> 207.82]  I want you to just become familiar with the project and uh, you probably you can ask for help
[208.30 --> 210.30]  But honestly given your background
[210.30 --> 213.42]  You're not even gonna need to ask for help. You got this
[213.42 --> 217.42]  Now can I just pause for one second here and point out that I?
[217.98 --> 218.94]  I
[218.94 --> 219.98]  already
[219.98 --> 221.02]  love
[221.02 --> 222.70]  everything about this because
[222.70 --> 226.14]  Jay diesel is such a good acronym
[226.70 --> 228.14]  I am like like
[228.14 --> 230.86]  Like like I love it like I
[230.86 --> 235.58]  Should have named something that I will try to make it there's there's
[236.22 --> 237.42]  Sorry
[237.42 --> 238.70]  I was muted. I was muted. I
[238.70 --> 239.42]  You
[239.42 --> 243.10]  I forgot I was muted. Okay, I was gonna make the comments
[243.10 --> 245.90]  Sorry, there's someone definitely at the jersey shore named j diesel right now
[245.90 --> 250.06]  Yes, that's exactly what i'm thinking i'm like hey, what's up j diesel?
[250.38 --> 254.94]  Like it's so good. Okay, you do one of those like like those claps where you hit
[254.94 --> 256.14]  He's just get out of the j diesel
[256.14 --> 262.30]  It goes on for like seven years and you're like when are you guys gonna stop saying hello like yeah, okay
[262.86 --> 267.26]  If I could be that cool, I could never be that cool cool. Obviously being new at the company
[267.26 --> 269.26]  What's the first thing you do?
[269.26 --> 271.26]  Well, you download tortoise svn
[272.78 --> 274.06]  Okay, walk
[274.06 --> 280.62]  Or thought it's or thought it was all this time. It's a tail as it really is and you uh
[281.58 --> 283.10]  You get the project you check it out
[283.10 --> 286.14]  But something happened when he checked out the project
[287.98 --> 291.26]  Estimated time of completion two days what?
[292.38 --> 295.82]  Wait, hold on. So just for the record
[296.78 --> 300.62]  Like all of the witness jonathan blow will be on tomorrow
[301.18 --> 304.14]  Yeah, all of that was checked into svn
[304.78 --> 312.70]  That's a giant 3d game the whole thing. How did they make it take two days to check out something from tortoise svn?
[313.10 --> 316.86]  Uh, casey, it's called the weekend like don't you know like every friday
[317.82 --> 319.82]  Check out see you guys on monday
[320.86 --> 325.82]  All right, okay, all right. They didn't call it hair svn. Okay, you got to make sure you take it out
[326.30 --> 332.14]  But low and steady wins the race. Okay, it's not that slow. So what have what's going on here jake?
[332.46 --> 333.34]  Well, you know, date
[333.34 --> 335.82]  That's a great question because jake had the exact same question
[335.82 --> 339.98]  He went to his co-worker and was just like man. This is taking two days. Am I doing something wrong?
[339.98 --> 346.14]  Yeah, uh, should I not use tortoise like well, what do I do here and they said oh no, this is actually this is expected
[346.14 --> 347.26]  This is very normal
[347.90 --> 349.90]  You should just play solitaire
[350.46 --> 356.78]  So solitaire he did and solitaire he continued and solitaire all the way to the end
[356.78 --> 359.90]  It's pretty nice, right?
[359.90 --> 361.98]  It's a good first week time
[361.98 --> 366.14]  Oh, yeah, that's a good first week is all you know what I mean like that's nice
[366.14 --> 371.42]  He's rolling. He has the project. He's making inroads with co-workers. He's feeling pretty good
[371.42 --> 375.82]  And so now's the time for him to shine. He's young. He's impressionable
[375.82 --> 378.78]  He's ready to put in the hours burn the midnight oil
[379.34 --> 383.10]  So he's gonna open up a random file, okay?
[384.30 --> 387.42]  But when he opens up the random file, he notices there's no comments
[388.38 --> 395.02]  There's nothing with it. He starts looking at a bunch of these weird json files trying to figure out what the heck's going on
[395.74 --> 399.58]  He doesn't get this he what is this what casey? What is this?
[399.58 --> 402.14]  That's that's looking
[403.34 --> 405.74]  I don't know what that is the you know
[406.38 --> 407.98]  Push the stack not a genius
[407.98 --> 413.26]  I don't want to interrupt this but i'll just say that functions 899 900 901
[413.98 --> 416.86]  I want to talk about that later because I got I got
[417.50 --> 423.50]  A mini rant we can talk about after that. So i'm remembering i'm remembering that functions array right there
[423.90 --> 425.34]  Okay, keep going
[425.34 --> 426.30]  Keep it going roll
[426.30 --> 432.30]  And then he opened up related files that had the same kind of name like customers json versus
[433.10 --> 436.30]  Customer.js and you just see it filled with a bunch of stuff
[437.02 --> 441.58]  But there's no comments anywhere nobody has left any breadcrumbs
[441.58 --> 448.62]  And there's all these function calls and things that are just making no sense. Nothing seems to be complete every file is completely
[448.62 --> 452.22]  Just filled with stuff that doesn't seem to exist
[452.46 --> 455.02]  And it was very very confusing for him
[456.70 --> 457.74]  So this is jake
[458.86 --> 464.22]  He has to do something that none of us want to do when we first landed a job and we just opened the code base
[464.22 --> 470.06]  We have to go to our co-worker and we're gonna have to ask for help and just look
[470.46 --> 476.06]  Like an idiot right off the bat like I can't even read the project help me read the project. So of course
[477.10 --> 480.70]  He goes to his co-worker and he goes hey, man, I I need some help
[480.70 --> 485.02]  I need you to kind of help me with what's happening this project because I feel genuinely confused
[485.02 --> 487.02]  I'm confused
[487.02 --> 492.14]  Oh, hold on. Sorry. I clicked the wrong page. This is this is while jake was working on batman
[493.58 --> 496.70]  2 or something. I don't i'm just looking at jake here. It was a while ago
[497.34 --> 503.90]  It was a while back. Yeah, it was a much earlier marvel film. Yeah, okay. Oh, sorry dc. Oh, sorry
[503.90 --> 506.06]  So his co-worker was like you just don't get it yet
[506.62 --> 508.62]  See the thing is is that j diesel
[508.86 --> 513.90]  It was written by tom and he's a super genius and he wrote j diesel all by himself
[514.86 --> 519.34]  And so basically that customers dot json file is just metadata used to put together
[520.22 --> 521.18]  the customer class
[521.98 --> 524.22]  And then he waited for jake to get it
[525.98 --> 527.26]  Jake did not get it in fact
[529.10 --> 529.82]  Jake did not
[530.70 --> 536.06]  So then he asked the only what's the next most logical question if you don't understand how code works
[536.54 --> 538.86]  And you can't just simply read it and understand it. What's your most
[539.26 --> 541.26]  What's the most logical conclusion you can do?
[541.26 --> 542.54]  Ask jtpt
[542.54 --> 544.54]  Yes, didn't exist
[544.54 --> 548.22]  It didn't exist at this time. It didn't it didn't exist vegan. What do you mean?
[548.22 --> 548.78]  Ask jeeves
[551.18 --> 556.38]  Well, of course you ask well, how do I run it? I'm just gonna debug it. I'm gonna figure some things out
[557.02 --> 558.46]  Well, scott laughed
[558.46 --> 562.30]  Okay, his co-worker laughed right as his face and said you wouldn't want to just run it
[562.30 --> 566.46]  It takes a couple days for a new deployment to finish starting up
[566.46 --> 568.46]  Jay diesel can be a little slow
[568.46 --> 572.46]  Slow but it's really powerful like super powerful
[572.46 --> 573.50]  Like I said tom
[573.50 --> 575.50]  He's a genius
[575.50 --> 577.50]  What is going on?
[577.50 --> 579.50]  This is nuts
[579.50 --> 583.98]  How do you think jake feels right now? Okay, he's confused too
[586.14 --> 586.78]  Part two
[586.78 --> 588.38]  Jay diesel
[589.18 --> 589.82]  In action
[589.82 --> 591.82]  I hope you guys are ready
[591.82 --> 593.82]  I hope you guys are ready
[593.82 --> 597.82]  If this isn't a jersey shore scene i would be so pissed this needs to be something
[597.82 --> 599.82]  He's at the beach pumping iron
[599.82 --> 602.78]  You know i'm not gonna do jersey shore bacon. You know it's against my religion. We already know this
[602.78 --> 606.70]  Oh, I also feel like j diesel kind of reminds me of vin diesel
[606.70 --> 610.14]  So i'm wondering if does this thing have a nickname like triple x or anything?
[610.14 --> 615.98]  You know what? It would be good, but it's all about family here. Okay, okay, c okay
[616.54 --> 618.30]  It's all about all about family
[619.66 --> 623.98]  So jake and his confusion he did the the next most likely thing you should do
[626.62 --> 628.94]  That's a real jake that's a real jake
[630.62 --> 635.42]  So what did you do well, he asked his co-worker can you at least walk me through
[635.42 --> 638.86]  What's going on because I am confused?
[639.98 --> 642.14]  Well, his co-worker he laughed again
[643.98 --> 645.42]  These young guys
[645.42 --> 651.26]  All right, so the genius part this is the genius part you know where it says class can you see that right there in the json file?
[651.82 --> 653.02]  Okay, good
[653.02 --> 655.02]  Well, that's the class name
[655.02 --> 658.70]  As you can see that's how this works and now do you see where it says functions?
[659.74 --> 660.54]  Yes, those
[660.54 --> 665.66]  Those those are subversion links to all the functions that make up that class
[667.82 --> 668.22]  What
[668.22 --> 672.78]  That's precisely what jake said he said
[673.50 --> 678.78]  I don't quite get this but I fear that I might get this and I don't want it to be true
[678.78 --> 685.58]  Yeah, i'm more i'm less scared about me having gotten that wrong than I am about me having gotten that right
[686.78 --> 687.82]  Precisely yeah
[687.82 --> 691.66]  So his co-worker seeing jake remain confused was like okay
[691.66 --> 695.74]  So you see how you have that customers.json and the customers.js file?
[695.74 --> 700.30]  The json file is the metadata and the js file has the code
[700.30 --> 706.38]  So you so the list of functions in the json file tells j diesel to look up those revisions
[706.78 --> 709.58]  Of the js file to find what functions are available
[709.58 --> 715.10]  And in that case the actual code and the revisions are located at svn revision 568
[715.66 --> 716.54]  899
[716.54 --> 718.06]  900
[718.06 --> 719.18]  901
[720.14 --> 721.42]  And the list keeps on going
[721.42 --> 722.54]  What
[722.54 --> 725.26]  Now hold on before you speak
[725.82 --> 731.98]  I don't jake stop being confused. I'm trying to finish this up here each revision of the customer js has one
[732.46 --> 734.46]  function
[734.46 --> 740.70]  So to add all functions you have to check all you have to do is check in your new code with the updated json metadata
[741.26 --> 742.62]  file with the new revisions
[743.66 --> 752.14]  Whenever something makes a function call to the customer object j diesel uses the list of function revisions to check out all of the actual functions
[752.78 --> 753.90]  Until it finds a match
[754.54 --> 755.50]  Do you understand it now?
[757.50 --> 758.54]  Yes, I
[759.34 --> 759.58]  Do
[761.74 --> 763.74]  And i'm mildly terrified
[765.18 --> 765.74]  Oh well
[765.74 --> 766.70]  Can I just ask
[767.90 --> 769.10]  One quick question
[769.82 --> 772.06]  Uh, what's the name of my co-worker again?
[772.06 --> 774.22]  Sorry, I forget his name is scott
[774.22 --> 774.54]  Scott
[775.74 --> 778.46]  If you're asking those kind of questions casey you're really behind
[778.46 --> 779.74]  Okay, yes
[779.74 --> 781.02]  So far behind, okay
[781.82 --> 782.62]  So scott
[784.14 --> 785.10]  I just
[785.10 --> 788.70]  Want to know when you say subversion revision number
[789.26 --> 793.02]  Do you literally mean that if I were to go fix
[793.66 --> 795.34]  say a bug in
[796.06 --> 799.02]  Revision 902 in this list for example
[799.34 --> 802.62]  And I checked it in and it became revision 3157
[803.18 --> 807.02]  I would have to go into this list and replace 902
[807.58 --> 809.10]  With 3157
[809.66 --> 815.66]  Otherwise, it would continue to use the old code that I had rechecked in a replacement for already
[816.46 --> 821.58]  You know, our manager did tell me that we had a hot new guns in here that could really pick up the project
[821.82 --> 824.70]  And it sounds like you are really understanding your stuff
[825.42 --> 825.50]  Oh
[825.50 --> 825.90]  No
[827.98 --> 829.82]  Casey you were built for this bro
[829.82 --> 831.34]  You were literally built for this
[831.34 --> 831.66]  Casey
[831.66 --> 832.78]  Jay diesel
[832.78 --> 834.22]  No, I'm confused this
[834.22 --> 837.10]  This is fine casey. Are you committing more than one function at a time?
[838.22 --> 838.70]  That's
[838.70 --> 842.14]  Well, even if I am only committing one function at a time
[842.14 --> 847.98]  So now I have to check in also the other I have to check in both files every time
[847.98 --> 852.70]  And of course multiple people might have to check in this file
[853.50 --> 855.90]  Because they're updating different functions
[856.78 --> 857.58]  Oh, first
[857.58 --> 863.02]  Casey you tell us you don't like clean code and now you're telling us you don't like clean revision
[863.02 --> 864.46]  I know man
[864.46 --> 865.98]  I don't know
[865.98 --> 866.94]  Wow, okay
[866.94 --> 871.10]  Well, let's do this. Keep going jay diesel. Let's let's uh
[871.66 --> 873.90]  This is like the chronicles of ridiculous
[873.90 --> 875.02]  Well, anyways
[875.90 --> 878.62]  Jake had the same response. He just said I
[879.98 --> 880.62]  Think so
[881.26 --> 881.58]  Yeah
[882.62 --> 886.62]  And his co-worker of course just said like I said tom he's a genius
[886.94 --> 888.30]  Okay, you see tom right here
[888.86 --> 892.54]  Yeah, man, he's a genius this lets you track every function that has ever
[893.18 --> 898.38]  Existed you can add new functions by overwriting a js file and adding a new revision to the json
[898.38 --> 901.18]  You can remove a function just by removing its revision number
[901.18 --> 906.70]  From the function list and it's still there in history inactive, but never lost
[908.54 --> 910.70]  Scott stood let me know if you have any more questions
[910.70 --> 911.66]  He left
[911.66 --> 912.78]  Jake's test
[918.62 --> 921.66]  Part three rise and grind
[921.66 --> 925.34]  Oh, this is about they started a terminal based coffee company
[927.66 --> 930.38]  That's actually what I was thinking when I made this tj
[931.18 --> 933.18]  So
[934.22 --> 937.74]  For jake no obstacles too big. He's young. He's virile
[937.74 --> 941.10]  He's ready to just just go out there and absolutely
[942.54 --> 943.18]  Crush
[943.18 --> 944.14]  the universe
[945.02 --> 950.62]  And so of course as soon as he realizes as he starts inspecting the code and really starts combing through it that this is
[950.62 --> 952.78]  Actually just a simple web portal
[953.26 --> 956.22]  For customers to be able to update their personal information
[956.22 --> 958.22]  But thanks to the complexity of j diesel
[958.22 --> 961.18]  What should take minutes now takes days
[961.18 --> 966.06]  A true 10x engineer this tom fella is and so
[966.06 --> 971.26]  So of course jake being a good citizen decides you know what?
[971.26 --> 973.10]  I can fix her
[973.10 --> 976.94]  I can get in here and I can make real changes that will help everybody
[976.94 --> 981.18]  So he started going through all the code familiarizing himself
[981.18 --> 985.58]  He started checking in a couple code comments letting people know what's going on
[986.14 --> 990.38]  Throughout the code and how they can kind of trace everything and even upon just looking at the code
[990.38 --> 994.38]  There was obvious bugs things that just will break
[994.38 --> 998.46]  So of course he started to even fix those check in new ones
[998.46 --> 1002.22]  Really making some amazing changes jake
[1002.22 --> 1004.14]  Is a good citizen
[1004.14 --> 1008.38]  Common jake w common jake w absolutely amazing
[1008.38 --> 1014.86]  Part four
[1017.34 --> 1017.66]  Tom
[1019.18 --> 1025.26]  Is tom still at this fictional company that is definitely not a company that you any of you have ever worked at
[1025.26 --> 1029.02]  Casey he's the only one who knows how this works we cannot buy your top
[1029.50 --> 1031.10]  Jay diesel casey
[1031.10 --> 1033.26]  I'm saying but is he still there or has he left
[1034.30 --> 1038.22]  Of this company we've never received an update from anybody who worked at this company
[1038.22 --> 1039.34]  At the time of this story
[1039.34 --> 1041.42]  At the time of the story at the time of the story
[1041.42 --> 1043.50]  Yes at the time of the story he was the lead engineer
[1044.30 --> 1044.70]  Okay
[1047.02 --> 1047.50]  All right
[1049.50 --> 1050.38]  That's fine
[1053.18 --> 1061.26]  Jake arrives Monday morning feeling great okay he he has made a lot of changes he's done a lot of good work
[1061.74 --> 1067.10]  Wrapped up the previous week worked well into the weekend and now he's arriving Monday morning
[1067.82 --> 1069.74]  But things were a miss things were odd
[1070.86 --> 1073.42]  People were running around people were freaking out
[1073.42 --> 1081.34]  Scott as you have recently learned his co-worker runs by and says the database got scrambled and he just keeps on going
[1081.34 --> 1085.42]  People are freaking out people are trying to figure out stuff and all of a sudden jake here's you
[1087.10 --> 1089.42]  And he turns around and sees tom
[1089.42 --> 1093.90]  And tom says hey jake you're jake right the new guy
[1095.50 --> 1095.74]  Yeah
[1097.10 --> 1097.58]  I am
[1098.78 --> 1101.42]  What's going on you broke j diesel
[1101.42 --> 1103.26]  By the way my name's tom
[1105.98 --> 1107.02]  And i'm a genius
[1107.02 --> 1107.90]  What
[1109.18 --> 1111.18]  Jake is confused what
[1112.30 --> 1112.46]  I
[1112.46 --> 1113.18]  I
[1113.18 --> 1113.34]  I
[1113.34 --> 1115.02]  I didn't i didn't i didn't do anything
[1115.02 --> 1115.42]  I
[1115.42 --> 1117.26]  How could i have broken it
[1118.30 --> 1124.70]  You broke j diesel i'm reporting you to the bosses and i'm having you fired and tom's
[1125.26 --> 1125.98]  turned around
[1125.98 --> 1129.26]  And stormed off leaving jake confused
[1130.46 --> 1132.06]  And jake just sat there in silence
[1134.06 --> 1135.02]  What has happened
[1135.02 --> 1139.90]  How did i break everything
[1142.22 --> 1142.86]  Part five
[1143.82 --> 1144.46]  The meeting
[1145.18 --> 1146.94]  This is a really good story by the way
[1147.74 --> 1149.18]  Thank you i didn't write it
[1149.18 --> 1151.10]  I'm full i really invested right now
[1151.98 --> 1156.38]  In the story of jake like like i'm like i i need to know this conclusion
[1157.34 --> 1158.70]  Oh the conclusion
[1160.54 --> 1165.18]  Let's just say everything is just so beautiful it's so so beautiful okay
[1166.70 --> 1171.18]  Well they have the grand meeting everybody gets there to have the grand meeting and discuss
[1172.30 --> 1179.02]  And one of the vps turn and look jake right in the ocular nerve and says tell us what you did to jake
[1179.18 --> 1179.50]  Diesel
[1180.30 --> 1184.54]  Now jake of course says i i don't i don't think i did anything i've only been here for two weeks
[1185.18 --> 1189.98]  Trying to learn j diesel how the customer portal works i don't even i don't even know how to deploy it
[1191.90 --> 1197.50]  Tom interjects in there and says you made few commits to subversion he was very upset about this
[1197.50 --> 1201.82]  Right because some things obviously happened jake did make some commits he made some comments he made some good stuff
[1201.98 --> 1209.02]  He said well, yes, I i added a few code comments trying to tom just jumps right in and says
[1209.18 --> 1214.86]  You can't use comments and j diesel tom shouted that's what broke it
[1214.86 --> 1219.66]  No
[1219.66 --> 1220.86]  No
[1220.86 --> 1221.82]  No
[1221.82 --> 1222.38]  No
[1224.38 --> 1225.26]  Jake stayed silent
[1226.06 --> 1227.42]  He's just trying to process
[1227.42 --> 1227.58]  No
[1227.58 --> 1227.74]  No
[1228.30 --> 1228.70]  Don't
[1228.70 --> 1229.02]  This
[1229.02 --> 1229.66]  No
[1229.66 --> 1231.02]  This cannot be true
[1231.02 --> 1232.14]  Are you
[1232.14 --> 1238.22]  This is true as far as we know as far as we've done as far as we can tell casey this is this is a real thing
[1238.78 --> 1243.26]  Casey if you write good code you shouldn't need comments all right my code self documenting
[1243.26 --> 1244.06]  Thank you
[1245.34 --> 1246.22]  Kind of a code smell
[1246.78 --> 1247.66]  Yeah, it's honestly
[1248.54 --> 1251.82]  It's kind of a sign right now casey kind of telling on yourself right now
[1253.90 --> 1254.30]  Okay
[1255.34 --> 1257.42]  He remains silent just trying to process
[1258.38 --> 1260.86]  How comments could wipe out a customer database
[1261.50 --> 1264.14]  All right, like tom continued after the pause
[1265.02 --> 1268.38]  I haven't added comment support to j diesel
[1269.10 --> 1271.18]  So the runtime executes
[1272.22 --> 1274.22]  Comments like normal code
[1274.94 --> 1278.62]  You must have had a couple database updates in the comments
[1279.34 --> 1279.98]  He asks
[1281.26 --> 1285.02]  Tom obviously being the genius zeros in on what could have been
[1285.82 --> 1286.46]  the problem
[1289.02 --> 1289.42]  What
[1290.14 --> 1290.94]  Jake of course
[1292.78 --> 1294.22]  He responds with well
[1294.22 --> 1297.42]  Yeah, I put a couple short syntax examples
[1297.42 --> 1300.86]  In a comment to to clarify and then tom
[1301.34 --> 1302.94]  Bursts up onto his feet and says
[1302.94 --> 1303.42]  I
[1303.42 --> 1304.62]  knew it
[1305.34 --> 1306.46]  You broke it
[1306.46 --> 1312.30]  He turned to the vp and said I can't deal with coders who don't understand the system
[1312.30 --> 1313.98]  You either fire jake
[1315.50 --> 1316.46]  or I quit
[1319.58 --> 1320.70]  Drops the microphone
[1320.70 --> 1324.14]  Leaves the meeting
[1324.14 --> 1326.06]  VP sitting there
[1326.62 --> 1328.62]  The upper crust of the management
[1329.18 --> 1333.42]  Baffled by jake's decisions to take down the customer database
[1333.42 --> 1337.98]  So the vp representative
[1338.54 --> 1340.70]  And hr start talking right there in front of jake
[1340.70 --> 1342.06]  They don't even act like he exists
[1342.06 --> 1345.26]  They just start talking about jake as if he was sitting there
[1345.58 --> 1349.66]  And they say I think our only course of action here is pretty clear
[1350.62 --> 1355.10]  Tom is a programming virtuoso and our best resource
[1355.98 --> 1358.22]  And jake just deleted the database
[1359.82 --> 1361.10]  We have to fire jake
[1367.66 --> 1369.42]  So jake went on to greener pastures
[1370.38 --> 1371.26]  He left the place
[1372.46 --> 1375.02]  Never to think about j diesel or tom again
[1375.02 --> 1377.74]  And now jake lives a much happier life
[1378.38 --> 1380.94]  Programming in a regular code base that is not insane
[1382.06 --> 1385.66]  And that is the story of tom
[1387.26 --> 1388.30]  The super genius
[1388.86 --> 1389.90]  Tom's a genius
[1389.90 --> 1392.78]  Tom is in fact a genius
[1392.78 --> 1393.90]  Let's see it in chat
[1393.90 --> 1394.86]  Tom's a genius
[1394.86 --> 1396.78]  Tom is a genius
[1396.78 --> 1400.94]  This is going to end with and tom's full name is
[1401.58 --> 1403.26]  Tonald github or something
[1403.26 --> 1404.06]  I don't know like
[1404.70 --> 1407.42]  Tom's full name the primogen
[1407.42 --> 1408.70]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[1408.70 --> 1410.94]  By the way, my name is tom if you didn't know that
[1412.70 --> 1414.14]  My real name is tom
[1414.70 --> 1415.74]  I just don't stream
[1415.74 --> 1416.38]  Thank you
[1417.66 --> 1418.70]  Tom Heimer
[1418.70 --> 1421.10]  All right, I wanted to read that
[1421.10 --> 1422.30]  I wanted to kind of give you that
[1423.18 --> 1425.50]  That a story because your your your build system
[1426.62 --> 1431.66]  It was comments that were executing code which just it just it reminded me of tom
[1431.66 --> 1434.22]  And prime we said there
[1434.22 --> 1435.66]  I don't remember if we said it
[1435.66 --> 1441.82]  We'll have to pull the footage or if casey said it one of us said that either casey you said i'm a genius when you were making it
[1441.82 --> 1443.98]  That's how you felt or we said you were a genius
[1444.38 --> 1449.58]  And that's why we were saying that was like the next level connection to this story
[1449.58 --> 1452.30]  Yes, well if the only difference is
[1453.02 --> 1455.02]  Here that like uh
[1455.02 --> 1459.98]  Everyone was very embarrassed about it afterwards which doesn't seem to have happened to tom
[1461.02 --> 1464.22]  Tom is apparently just fine with it
[1464.22 --> 1465.58]  That's because tom's a genius
[1465.58 --> 1468.14]  Tom is apparently a genius yes
[1469.02 --> 1471.50]  Honestly case though you should adopt some of these coding practices
[1471.50 --> 1474.94]  I would say get comments out of your code because I did read an announcement
[1474.94 --> 1479.10]  GitHub's gonna announce next week. They will be charging more for comments in the code base
[1479.50 --> 1482.62]  So if you can just get into the good habit of removing them
[1482.62 --> 1484.78]  They're charging per line of code hosted
[1484.78 --> 1487.34]  Yeah per line of code hosted so every piece of documentation
[1487.34 --> 1488.62]  Per line of code hosted per minute of course
[1488.62 --> 1490.14]  It's a very confusing thing
[1491.18 --> 1495.02]  So I guess if i'm reading between the lines here
[1496.06 --> 1497.82]  And obviously since this is a
[1499.02 --> 1504.46]  Not a story certainly that happened to anyone here you're just recounting an abstract story about two people
[1505.58 --> 1510.70]  One named tom and one named jake who don't have any connection to the real world in any way
[1510.70 --> 1511.02]  Correct
[1511.82 --> 1512.62]  Um
[1512.94 --> 1515.26]  It is kind of hard for me to
[1516.54 --> 1519.90]  Understand how that code was written
[1520.70 --> 1522.46]  Like so it
[1523.42 --> 1525.74]  The parser doesn't fail
[1526.54 --> 1527.82]  When it hits a comment
[1528.62 --> 1530.70]  It just ignores the comment
[1531.58 --> 1533.58]  And and the parser is
[1533.58 --> 1536.22]  It's actually like someone re-implemented
[1536.22 --> 1537.74]  A javascript
[1538.30 --> 1543.18]  Runtime of their own because they're not using an existing one or it would have handled comments
[1543.82 --> 1546.30]  So they re-implemented the javascript
[1548.22 --> 1548.94]  Runtime
[1550.22 --> 1550.70]  Parse
[1550.70 --> 1553.02]  It's it's not you're making it entirely too hard
[1553.02 --> 1553.82]  Yeah, I am
[1553.82 --> 1554.14]  Casey
[1554.14 --> 1555.74]  Casey does
[1557.74 --> 1559.10]  Just answer me the simple question
[1559.10 --> 1559.74]  Yeah
[1559.74 --> 1561.66]  Does the line have select on it?
[1563.82 --> 1564.14]  Okay
[1564.14 --> 1564.94]  So
[1564.94 --> 1565.74]  So
[1565.74 --> 1572.06]  Is what you're saying it basically just searches for the word select then takes everything to the end of the line and runs it or something like that?
[1572.06 --> 1574.06]  That's all I'm saying is hey
[1574.06 --> 1574.30]  Okay
[1574.30 --> 1574.54]  Okay
[1574.54 --> 1575.74]  If it has select on it
[1575.74 --> 1576.86]  It's code
[1576.86 --> 1578.62]  That sounds like a database query to me
[1579.42 --> 1579.74]  Or
[1580.70 --> 1584.22]  Multi-line comments and it's doing something line by line
[1584.22 --> 1585.34]  That's the other one
[1585.90 --> 1587.18]  That I think is pretty possible
[1587.18 --> 1589.58]  Guys let's be easy on Casey too
[1589.58 --> 1590.30]  Tom's a genius
[1590.30 --> 1593.90]  Casey's not going to understand his intricate system right away
[1593.90 --> 1594.62]  Yeah
[1594.62 --> 1595.82]  Okay, that's a good point
[1595.82 --> 1596.22]  That's a good point
[1596.22 --> 1598.38]  I can't just drop in here and ask you know
[1598.78 --> 1602.06]  These these sort of pedestrian questions of a genius mind
[1603.18 --> 1607.66]  That is just way past any of us here on this on this podcast
[1607.66 --> 1608.62]  I I agree with that
[1608.62 --> 1609.02]  This is
[1609.02 --> 1611.18]  I want to know what everyone's thoughts are
[1611.18 --> 1616.70]  What are the chances they had a singular backup at any time of production?
[1619.10 --> 1620.14]  I would assume no
[1620.14 --> 1624.78]  No, just based on the VP and everybody's reaction to the customer data being deleted
[1624.78 --> 1626.54]  That was a hard no right there
[1627.74 --> 1628.70]  I was gonna say so this is
[1628.70 --> 1629.74]  That would be so stressful
[1629.74 --> 1632.54]  This is one of those ones where someone's like this system's insane
[1632.54 --> 1634.46]  And you just hit him with uh uh
[1634.46 --> 1636.38]  You want me to look up Chesterton's fence all right?
[1636.38 --> 1638.38]  There's a reason why all right?
[1638.38 --> 1640.38]  I don't have time to give you the lore
[1640.38 --> 1640.94]  Yeah
[1640.94 --> 1643.10]  But trust me it's there all right?
[1643.10 --> 1643.74]  Yeah
[1643.74 --> 1645.26]  We
[1645.26 --> 1647.82]  We use a uh
[1647.82 --> 1651.98]  We use a negative three negative two negative one backup strategy
[1652.78 --> 1653.98]  Uh for this
[1654.70 --> 1660.46]  And uh you know so that means if anything happens we just don't have any copies of the database anymore
[1661.42 --> 1662.38]  Yeah, see prime
[1662.38 --> 1665.26]  I see I would have been the guy that would have kept a backup earlier
[1665.26 --> 1667.42]  But then I found out in my young junior career
[1667.42 --> 1672.54]  The like security gets really mad when you make a backup of production database on your computer
[1672.54 --> 1678.22]  Like they hated I was like guys i'm being safe and they said so all of the real phone
[1678.22 --> 1683.34]  I'm, like yeah, the real phone number so so what it's what if we accidentally lose the database?
[1683.34 --> 1687.02]  I have it and they told me to get it off my computer and um
[1687.82 --> 1690.78]  Yeah, that uh big it that sounds actually really reasonable
[1692.38 --> 1694.70]  So what are you doing with that on your computer?
[1695.98 --> 1697.02]  Try to save the company
[1697.02 --> 1703.02]  I I do want to I do want to put in some kind of a way that we can do like a hard break here
[1703.66 --> 1706.86]  At some point because I want to talk about this
[1706.86 --> 1712.30]  This is actually somewhat of a more serious topic. I wanted to talk about that function array thing
[1712.30 --> 1714.30]  We'll do the hard break right here about this
[1714.30 --> 1716.70]  So I want to make a way that because because what i'm well
[1717.26 --> 1719.66]  Meta talk about it first, too. So can we do a hard break?
[1719.66 --> 1722.46]  Yeah, yeah, let me just do a really quick very simple hard break
[1722.46 --> 1729.02]  Hey, if you're joining us on youtube, you're gonna have to listen to the full episode on spotify link in the description
[1729.42 --> 1734.78]  Thanks for joining us at the stand-up. Thank you very much for having casey vegan and tj on the stand-up
[1735.02 --> 1738.30]  If you're not familiar with casey's work check out computer enhance.com
[1738.94 --> 1742.22]  Also, we might post some of the clips on stan on uh different channels
[1742.22 --> 1744.38]  So check that link in the description, too true
[1744.78 --> 1745.74]  So I
[1746.54 --> 1753.34]  I am going to try and say everything i'm about to say in the same kind of tom jake way because I don't want
[1753.90 --> 1754.70]  to
[1754.70 --> 1756.70]  create any drama
[1756.70 --> 1757.90]  God
[1757.90 --> 1760.06]  Because this will wait for whatever this story is
[1760.38 --> 1764.54]  This will create this will create so much drama even probably me pseudonym this
[1765.10 --> 1767.66]  Because it's like it would be like youtuber drama, right?
[1769.26 --> 1771.26]  Oh, I've seen some so i'm just gonna
[1771.26 --> 1775.58]  It's a shocking story when you get youtuber drama primogen quickly. We need a thumbnail
[1775.90 --> 1779.58]  Picture of tom he's done. Okay, two texts. He's done
[1783.34 --> 1785.34]  Red text on bottom
[1787.42 --> 1789.42]  You're fired
[1790.70 --> 1792.86]  So i don't watch
[1793.82 --> 1795.82]  Very much programming
[1796.14 --> 1800.38]  YouTube what i just don't right and the reason for that is
[1800.38 --> 1801.82]  Now you're kind of saying that lie
[1801.82 --> 1803.18]  It hurts a little bit
[1803.18 --> 1805.18]  Wow, casey
[1805.18 --> 1805.58]  Sorry
[1806.94 --> 1808.78]  Uh, and the reason for that's pretty obvious, right?
[1808.78 --> 1811.34]  Like I just don't have time to do that
[1811.34 --> 1814.94]  So when i'm going to go watch youtube, I watch something like
[1815.58 --> 1817.98]  Totally unrelated to work, right?
[1817.98 --> 1819.98]  I don't go watch programming youtube
[1820.54 --> 1824.86]  Eddie, you know, I don't know i'm sure if I was younger like if you know when I was growing up
[1824.86 --> 1828.54]  I would have watched programming youtube all the time because oh my god
[1828.54 --> 1832.70]  It's exactly what I missed when I was little like how do you do this?
[1832.70 --> 1836.70]  Or what are the real programmers doing like it's such an amazing resource
[1837.74 --> 1838.78]  When you're younger
[1838.78 --> 1839.34]  Thanks, Casey
[1839.34 --> 1839.90]  Thanks, Casey
[1839.90 --> 1842.70]  You don't need the post plays, okay?
[1842.70 --> 1846.14]  No, i'm serious. I'm dead serious when I was little
[1846.14 --> 1847.90]  This is what I would have loved right?
[1847.90 --> 1850.70]  But when you're older you're just like i'm gonna go watch
[1851.26 --> 1856.30]  Freaking beard meets food or something like i'm gonna go watch some guy eat go like to a restaurant
[1856.54 --> 1862.14]  And eat like 5 000 chicken wings and just because like I i'm don't want to you know
[1862.54 --> 1866.14]  If you work at the mcdonald's you don't want to come home and eat a box of mcnuggets, right?
[1866.14 --> 1868.06]  That's just how that works sometimes
[1868.62 --> 1871.50]  So anyway, I don't watch very much programming youtube
[1871.50 --> 1875.90]  So i'm not necessarily always aware of all the things that are going on
[1877.02 --> 1883.74]  But a couple months back there was some drama that I will not refer to specifically
[1885.02 --> 1885.34]  and
[1886.86 --> 1893.90]  One of the people involved with the drama is sort of in game development programming
[1895.58 --> 1895.90]  and
[1895.90 --> 1899.10]  a second youtuber
[1899.10 --> 1900.38]  who
[1900.38 --> 1903.58]  sort of a second youtuber has hit the story
[1903.58 --> 1905.10]  i'm
[1905.10 --> 1907.42]  i'm dying on the inside like
[1907.42 --> 1908.46]  like
[1908.46 --> 1909.90]  a second youtuber
[1910.94 --> 1917.26]  decides to sort of capitalize on the drama that's going on with this first youtuber by
[1919.02 --> 1922.70]  doing like a code review of that person's code
[1922.70 --> 1923.90]  yeah, right now
[1925.26 --> 1925.66]  okay
[1926.78 --> 1927.42]  and now
[1927.42 --> 1930.22]  being the dick that I am
[1932.06 --> 1934.38]  I watched this video because i'm like
[1934.94 --> 1942.30]  all right like i'm gonna watch this guy do a code review because like i would be very snarky about most people's code reviews, right?
[1943.34 --> 1947.58]  so i watched this code review and one of the things that the person is like
[1947.58 --> 1948.78]  like
[1948.78 --> 1951.42]  he's like on a very high horse about
[1951.42 --> 1953.42]  the fact that this code
[1953.42 --> 1954.14]  has
[1954.14 --> 1954.94]  numbers
[1954.94 --> 1956.70]  like that function array in it
[1957.42 --> 1958.46]  to refer to
[1959.26 --> 1959.74]  like
[1959.74 --> 1960.78]  random things like
[1960.78 --> 1961.34]  oh, you know
[1961.34 --> 1963.82]  it's got number 328 is some
[1963.82 --> 1966.54]  index into a table of dialogue or something like that
[1966.54 --> 1968.54]  and the person's like
[1968.54 --> 1969.34]  this is just
[1969.34 --> 1970.22]  obviously
[1970.22 --> 1973.50]  demonstrates that this person has no idea what they're doing
[1973.50 --> 1976.22]  and couldn't possibly be a professional programmer
[1976.22 --> 1979.02]  and it's just a charlatan and a fraud and all these sorts of things
[1979.02 --> 1980.06]  and i just want
[1980.06 --> 1982.70]  i was wishing i had the button of like
[1982.70 --> 1985.74]  i can interject into other people's youtube streams to just be like
[1986.54 --> 1987.02]  i'm like
[1987.58 --> 1988.38]  actually
[1989.74 --> 1990.46]  actually
[1990.46 --> 1991.26]  right
[1991.26 --> 1992.38]  hard actually
[1992.38 --> 1993.98]  hard actually
[1993.98 --> 1994.86]  i'm like
[1995.66 --> 2003.42]  if you are at the point in your career where you think an uncommented bare table of numbers
[2003.42 --> 2008.62]  showing up in the middle of code shows that someone isn't a professional programmer
[2009.66 --> 2014.14]  you're the person who isn't a professional programmer, right?
[2014.14 --> 2015.26]  you've never had to get
[2015.26 --> 2016.94]  every fucking code face
[2017.66 --> 2019.74]  has some shit like that in it
[2020.70 --> 2024.30]  and there's always an explanation and it's always bad
[2024.30 --> 2026.70]  but that's what happens
[2026.70 --> 2027.10]  all right
[2027.10 --> 2027.74]  like
[2027.74 --> 2029.42]  that is what happens
[2029.42 --> 2032.06]  so actually it's the other way around
[2032.06 --> 2034.06]  like you're the novice
[2034.06 --> 2036.30]  and you're the one without the work experience
[2036.30 --> 2038.22]  if you look at something like that
[2038.22 --> 2041.18]  and say that it's like evidence that this is unshippable
[2041.18 --> 2041.98]  i'm like
[2041.98 --> 2043.90]  go to any freaking web cup
[2043.90 --> 2044.70]  go to google
[2044.70 --> 2045.42]  go to amazon
[2045.42 --> 2045.98]  whatever
[2045.98 --> 2048.14]  we'll find that code for you my friend
[2048.14 --> 2049.10]  it's in there
[2049.50 --> 2050.94]  it's running the thing you're
[2050.94 --> 2053.02]  it's probably in youtube's code base
[2053.02 --> 2055.10]  that you use to upload this
[2055.10 --> 2056.38]  has one of those in there
[2056.38 --> 2056.70]  all right
[2057.58 --> 2059.98]  so that's what that reminded me of when you saw that function
[2059.98 --> 2060.62]  i was like
[2060.62 --> 2061.02]  yup
[2061.02 --> 2063.10]  i know that list of numbers
[2063.10 --> 2063.34]  right
[2063.34 --> 2064.22]  yes
[2064.22 --> 2064.70]  anyway
[2064.70 --> 2066.70]  first off i do know the video you're talking about
[2066.70 --> 2067.74]  and i knew that
[2067.74 --> 2074.86]  i wasn't gonna i wasn't gonna enjoy the video in any regards because at the beginning he pulls out books as his evidence for his authority
[2074.86 --> 2078.06]  it's just like one of those clean code
[2078.06 --> 2078.78]  and he's just like
[2078.78 --> 2079.90]  he just pulled out clean
[2079.90 --> 2081.66]  no he did not pull out clean code
[2081.66 --> 2082.62]  no
[2082.62 --> 2087.74]  it's just like brother that's a great that's like a crazy way to start anything be like i read books
[2087.74 --> 2088.38]  it was nuts
[2088.38 --> 2089.02]  you don't
[2089.02 --> 2091.74]  i get my ready every time i want to have an argument
[2091.74 --> 2093.98]  i don't know you guys you guys don't have yours ready
[2093.98 --> 2098.70]  the only the only book i keep ready on mine is i just keep that one ready to go at all times but uh
[2098.70 --> 2101.10]  you're gonna feel a gossiping father
[2101.10 --> 2105.10]  i just keep whenever i need some advice for the family this is what that helps me out
[2105.10 --> 2106.70]  this is not going on spotify right
[2106.70 --> 2107.10]  josh
[2107.10 --> 2109.10]  censor that book please
[2109.10 --> 2112.06]  censor that book josh
[2112.06 --> 2113.10]  yes
[2113.10 --> 2115.42]  i'm just
[2115.42 --> 2117.10]  i'm getting ready for the next stage of my life
[2117.10 --> 2119.10]  oh my gosh
[2119.10 --> 2119.58]  yeah
[2119.58 --> 2122.54]  it was so funny you actually made the stream chat break
[2122.54 --> 2125.98]  sorry i gotta get a new stream chat this thing breaks constantly
[2125.98 --> 2131.90]  that's amazing so what is it's like what is chapter one of that book like how to put a pill into a drink
[2131.90 --> 2137.50]  what's the what's what's the start of fatherhood what's the reco on that one
[2138.38 --> 2139.90]  okay a dramatic reading of father
[2139.90 --> 2143.98]  yeah chapter one is at some point your date will wake back up
[2145.02 --> 2150.46]  the the the opening chapter is called the baffling question i'll let you guys guess what it's about okay
[2150.46 --> 2156.22]  okay all right uh wait on the code review thing i will say i love the idea i kind of want to just
[2156.22 --> 2162.14]  join a new company just so i can be like my first code review i'm gonna produce a youtube video instead
[2162.14 --> 2168.62]  and just like can you do code review and right away it's just like trash look at this trash code
[2168.62 --> 2173.82]  this if statement what an idiot and it's like stop uploading youtube videos for the github
[2173.82 --> 2179.50]  that i'll get fired right away but it'll be funny we should companies should have prime go in and we
[2179.50 --> 2184.70]  can look at a terrible piece of code and then they can tell us why it has to be that way that would
[2184.70 --> 2190.38]  actually be fun yeah yeah because there's there's always bad code and a lot of it was just like well
[2190.38 --> 2195.98]  you know we are under some pressure and things were this way and this one service wasn't quite right so
[2195.98 --> 2202.70]  we had to or it's uh or it's like we've refactored it three times and we got back to the same code
[2202.70 --> 2208.62]  every time we started we did a refactor and then it was the same exact piece of code so we deleted the
[2208.62 --> 2216.46]  we deleted that branch and moved on next year's new new recruits they tried the same thing they all died
[2216.46 --> 2222.38]  right here here's here's the here let me let me give an analogy for any really like new programmers
[2222.38 --> 2227.90]  out there who are watching this if you've ever watched a professional baseball game
[2228.46 --> 2232.62]  right if you know anything about baseball at all or you played little league or whatever
[2233.66 --> 2241.66]  so if you are in little league and they're teaching you how to hit they're going to be like okay you
[2241.66 --> 2245.90]  you know you put your back foot here in the the batter's box put your front foot out and you're
[2245.90 --> 2249.74]  going to put your weight like this you're going to hold the bat like this right you're going to step
[2249.74 --> 2253.58]  forward and you're going to you know do this thing and all that they're they're coaching you on all
[2253.58 --> 2262.30]  this stuff and keep your head down right that's what people tell you about code review or what they
[2262.30 --> 2268.54]  do in a code review you watch an actual major league hitter and the instructions would be like okay first
[2268.54 --> 2273.66]  you take your batting gloves off like 67 times and put them back on then you like you know make the sign
[2273.66 --> 2279.34]  of the cross and like adjust the gold chain or whatever then you like do some crazy thing like
[2279.34 --> 2284.94]  like like like hold the bat way the hell up here and then you like corkscrew it around and then but
[2284.94 --> 2290.38]  finally you sort of get back into a real actual swing and you hit a home run right and you win the
[2290.38 --> 2296.62]  freaking game and you're an amazing batter right the same exact thing is true of coding all the crap that
[2296.62 --> 2303.42]  they tell you about all this stuff then you go look at some coder who's like absolutely bonkers crazy
[2303.42 --> 2309.50]  amazing and like wrote like tom the inner loop like not tom like a really good programmer and it's like
[2309.50 --> 2315.18]  you look and it's like all the variable names are like one letter right it's just like they have what
[2315.18 --> 2321.18]  they got into and the way that they code and they're really good at it and it's not the pristine thing
[2321.18 --> 2327.02]  that's the best you know practices advice that's just that's the reality of it it's exactly like major
[2327.02 --> 2333.26]  league baseball right it just it doesn't work the instructional way so it's okay like those things
[2333.26 --> 2339.50]  are always sort of general guidelines that we're trying to push you towards more readable more
[2339.50 --> 2346.22]  maintainable code but the reality of programming is dirtier than that that's just how it is uh so it's
[2346.22 --> 2350.30]  okay well there's a divide i see this on the internet all the time it's always it's a lot of times people
[2350.30 --> 2355.66]  who are like haven't had their job yet that's usually and they're excited they love code they're trying
[2355.66 --> 2359.90]  to get smart sometimes they're in school sometimes they're just youtube fiends and they're just like
[2359.90 --> 2364.78]  why wouldn't you just take the extra time to make the code perfect why wouldn't you just always make
[2364.78 --> 2369.42]  it right and it's like okay they're called deadlines they're called managers it's all a lot of factors
[2369.42 --> 2373.82]  that will never ever ever let you do that in the real world but you just don't know until you get a job
[2373.82 --> 2378.70]  and then you get a job and four years later you're a different person and you laugh at those kids and
[2378.70 --> 2384.38]  then the next new crop comes up and it happens again it's it's never anything i'll tell you i can literally
[2384.38 --> 2391.66]  tell you so the like jeff roberts the guy who ran rad game tools easily one of the best programmers ever
[2392.22 --> 2398.54]  all the code is basically just like that it's like a bunch of like every variable is one letter
[2398.54 --> 2403.98]  it's all just kind of like lined up like it's it's not that easy to read this code and you'd be like
[2403.98 --> 2408.22]  that's ridiculous how can anyone work with code like that it's insane like how do you maintain it how
[2408.22 --> 2416.62]  do you go back and read it he wrote the compression algorithms for one of the products that i did
[2416.62 --> 2422.94]  basically all the other code for he gave it to me sorry what is it called no it's it was granny the
[2422.94 --> 2430.06]  3d animation system okay it had a compressor built in and he gave me that code he gave me that code uh when
[2430.06 --> 2437.90]  he finished making it it went into the project my project there was never a bug ever in the entire not
[2437.90 --> 2446.30]  once i never had to even open those files that's just how good it is he just gives you this like here's
[2446.30 --> 2451.58]  a complete compressor i wrote for scratch completely for your project and only your project i've only ever
[2451.58 --> 2458.06]  done my coding and my testing on it it shipped to customers never broke once in the entire time i mean that
[2458.06 --> 2466.22]  for five years i maintained that project and it never broke once so it's just like the reality is
[2466.22 --> 2472.78]  sometimes people are just very very good at doing code the way they do it and if they get the results
[2472.78 --> 2479.74]  that's fine don't you know then at the same time you get j diesel or something right the system worked
[2479.74 --> 2485.58]  casey if everyone would just follow along it was fine until j came along yeah just because at runtime when
[2485.58 --> 2488.86]  a customer wants to change information you have to do an svn lookup to find out the function does
[2488.86 --> 2495.02]  not mean it wasn't perfect tortois oh we know our code is always matching our actual committed code
[2495.02 --> 2502.62]  oh no that's integrity yeah yeah anyway or it's one tj on your story about rewriting it yeah i know
[2502.62 --> 2506.70]  i've told the story once before but when i was working on falcor there was a piece of requesting
[2507.26 --> 2511.26]  that really bothered me because i was like dude this code's ugly and this was still during my time where
[2511.26 --> 2515.74]  i thought i could just write really great code all the time and so during this like hey this code is
[2515.74 --> 2521.42]  ugly phase uh for requesting so it was a data fetcher in javascript that would try to match what's
[2521.42 --> 2526.78]  already on the tv and then what's like the minimum amount of data it needs to request next so that way
[2526.78 --> 2531.34]  all the things doing like all the components being like hey i need to display these 20 titles it goes
[2531.34 --> 2535.10]  okay i already have 17 of the titles i'm gonna make a request for the remaining three right so it was a
[2535.10 --> 2540.70]  pretty clever piece of array manipulation is all it was and so i do this this whole like
[2540.70 --> 2544.54]  rewrite of the requesting because i'm like this is bad and at first i'm like dude look how much better
[2544.54 --> 2549.10]  mine is already the code's way more readable it's all these kind of things and then i'm like oh crap
[2549.10 --> 2552.62]  i forgot this one case and so then i added in this next case i'm like okay it's like a little bit closer
[2552.62 --> 2556.86]  but still it's way more readable and like oh crap i forgot this one case and by the time i all
[2556.86 --> 2562.38]  crapped i forgot this one case at the end it was almost a line for line rewrite of exactly what
[2562.38 --> 2574.06]  and then that's when i realized i'm the problem no that's when you realized i was so smart before
[2574.06 --> 2579.18]  and i'm still really smart you got the wrong conclusion from that prime yeah yeah yeah all
[2579.18 --> 2583.02]  right and then of course since we're kind of talking about this and people coding this has
[2583.02 --> 2587.66]  been my favorite tweet for the last couple weeks or the last week i just keep thinking about it over
[2587.66 --> 2592.22]  and over and over again the inner tweet goes like this just found out this all right just found
[2592.22 --> 2598.86]  out that since this i've become a top 50 user devin globally pushing 60 trs a day ask me anything
[2599.50 --> 2604.62]  now remember uh devin if you don't know it's like this kind of like uh it's like an interesting update
[2605.42 --> 2613.02]  interesting update that's pretty interesting hunter an interesting update the team is starting to move
[2613.02 --> 2618.30]  away from ai coding completely devin claude because it's so much harder to review the ai code than writing
[2618.30 --> 2624.86]  things themselves it's like my it's it's my favorite it it is my favorite it's just so funny
[2624.86 --> 2631.34]  to be like dude i'm pushing 60 prs a day actually my team kind of got upset it was like how it started
[2631.34 --> 2637.90]  how it's going that was the perfect like self self-created one of those the the funny thing too is
[2637.90 --> 2643.10]  that's exactly the amount of time they said before software engineering is dead they're like oh six months
[2643.10 --> 2647.82]  from now we're not going to have software developer jobs and they're like we we actually deleted all
[2647.82 --> 2655.18]  the stuff we tried when we said that this definitely ends up like south park where it's like they're
[2655.18 --> 2659.50]  like oh my god he's pushing 60 prs a day it's too much i just have to use ai to review it but i can't
[2659.50 --> 2664.06]  tell him and then he's over there using ai and both of them are just like oh my god i hate this we're
[2664.06 --> 2670.54]  both just ai each other and we're not telling each other yeah all right well there you go so casey how
[2670.54 --> 2677.74]  do you feel you've learned the story of tom how was it i mean this is this is the thing right like
[2680.06 --> 2688.38]  we've all been there we've all we've all been j diesel and here's the thing i just feel fortunate
[2689.02 --> 2697.98]  that for that my j diesel phase the worst thing that happened was that build utility right i never i never
[2698.94 --> 2707.90]  shipped anything quite so horrible as as the entire company's customer database is now running externally
[2707.90 --> 2715.50]  on this disaster thing that i made right uh so i feel like it's definitely it's there but for the
[2715.50 --> 2721.26]  grace of god go i i think is the phrase that people often use for something like this it's like you're
[2721.26 --> 2728.54]  gonna have some phase in your programming career where you just go down a rat hole or rabbit hole
[2728.54 --> 2732.78]  i guess as people more commonly called i've always called it a rat hole or you know i guess i grew up
[2732.78 --> 2737.74]  maybe massachusetts it's a rat hole we have more rats than rabbits i don't know what's going on over
[2737.74 --> 2744.46]  there more rats than rabbits um so you know you go down this thing and you get this wild hair and you're
[2744.46 --> 2749.26]  like this is going to be awesome i'm so smart but you just don't have the experience to realize that
[2749.26 --> 2756.22]  you're really actually being pretty stupid it happens to everybody at some point some people
[2756.22 --> 2762.70]  like tom are too much of a genius to ever pull out of it so they just stay that way and become head of
[2762.70 --> 2769.74]  of engineering and their companies like engineering is terminally screwed um but yeah like the rest of us
[2769.74 --> 2775.58]  like it's just you hope you get out of that phase before anyone really does start relying like before
[2775.58 --> 2780.06]  you hope you don't end up in a situation where there's nobody smarter around you to like go oh
[2780.06 --> 2786.78]  that's nice casey like uh just let's not do that and then you know in a year or two you've gotten
[2786.78 --> 2792.46]  better and you know better right uh so i'm just fortunate i never did anything quite so terrible i guess
[2792.46 --> 2797.50]  is what i would say uh but i came close yeah you know there's something very funny about that which is that
[2797.50 --> 2805.98]  uh we all get the chance to do that in some at some capacity yeah but having people tell you you're
[2805.98 --> 2810.62]  a programming virtuoso would reinforce the cycle of what you're doing is actually the correct thing
[2810.62 --> 2815.34]  like you could actually you could go your whole life thinking you're doing the right thing exactly and
[2815.98 --> 2823.98]  it's just because programming is such a complicated endeavor without a lot of like hard metrics like
[2823.98 --> 2832.86]  you know in one in one sense i do think if i can poke tom's genius balloon with a pin just a little
[2832.86 --> 2840.38]  bit once you're at the point where it takes two days to check out your freaking customer database
[2840.38 --> 2845.02]  that's a good hard metric telling you that you're actually an idiot not a genius right so there was a
[2845.02 --> 2851.02]  hard metric here that someone should have actually latched on to at some point but a lot of times you
[2851.02 --> 2856.70]  don't actually have a hard metric like a lot of times you can get pretty far with something where
[2856.70 --> 2861.82]  you're kind of ignoring the red flags like you know for what you're like in that relationship where
[2861.82 --> 2866.70]  it's like it's been going on for a while and there's definitely some red flags but it's not like you know
[2867.34 --> 2873.18]  it's not obvious enough to you yet because you're still wrapped up in it or whatever so i do think there
[2873.18 --> 2877.90]  is a real danger of that because a lot of times there just isn't an obvious thing you can point to that's
[2877.90 --> 2885.42]  the clear sign that you're wrong um and it can go on for a very long time i will say uh one thing
[2885.42 --> 2889.82]  that's it's i really suggest everyone in their life hopefully they have someone who they only talk to
[2889.82 --> 2895.42]  once a year about coding and so then when you come back they get to say okay what trend are you on now
[2895.42 --> 2900.46]  i just got it i just got to experience at uh thanksgiving my uncle is like an old c programmer
[2900.46 --> 2904.38]  so for a decade he's been hearing me about what i'm excited about once a year at christmas
[2904.38 --> 2909.98]  and he started just roasting me throughout the history he was like oh yeah remember when you were
[2909.98 --> 2915.42]  saying everything's going to be a function no more no more microservices oh yeah how'd that go for you
[2915.42 --> 2919.66]  hey remember when you said memory's just going to keep getting cheaper ruby's going to scale
[2919.66 --> 2924.54]  remember that phase and he just like see he roasted me for a decade of everything and i was like oh i
[2924.54 --> 2929.26]  forgot about each of those because i'm on to the next one already i'm a genius i'm on i'm
[2929.26 --> 2934.78]  an elixir a stack now it's going to scale to the moon otp don't worry about it i guys guys i have a
[2934.78 --> 2945.50]  billion dollar idea okay here it is you ready for this yeah code therapist it's not a mentor not a life
[2945.50 --> 2953.18]  coach not a not programming courses none of that it's a therapist you go to this person for an hour a week
[2953.74 --> 2958.78]  right obviously we'll drive it by ai won't actually have humans involved because it's got to be a billion
[2958.78 --> 2966.70]  got to be big vc money yeah and what you do is you talk about the code and they ask you they're like
[2967.26 --> 2972.30]  so tell me about your build environment right and they're like you start talking about it and then
[2972.30 --> 2977.74]  they kind of ask you those questions and they help you get in touch with like your inner like like how
[2977.74 --> 2984.54]  you're actually relating to this code and whether you are starting to evince pathologies like tom right
[2984.54 --> 2992.06]  like and there could be like a dsm equivalent that basically has like here are the neuroses
[2992.06 --> 2997.82]  that you may have and they try to like help you uncover those right tell me tell me about tell me
[2997.82 --> 3003.26]  about your code review tell me about this i i feel like this could be a thing i like this casey i like
[3003.26 --> 3008.54]  this a lot i'm i'm in full support of it i think they called scrub masters though yeah they're called
[3008.54 --> 3014.38]  they're called scrum masters that's literally i think it's called hr is that not what hr is
[3014.94 --> 3019.50]  you're in there every week vegan lots of they love my jokes yeah they always ask to hear
[3019.50 --> 3025.58]  code therapy though code therapy code therapy sounds so funny yeah oh my gosh i want to do it with
[3025.58 --> 3032.22]  somebody like do you did like how did that variable name make you feel okay call prime call dr k and say
[3032.22 --> 3036.62]  i want to be a code therapist teach me how to be a code therapist and then we can have you just give
[3036.62 --> 3041.66]  therapy to someone on stream and he can be on stream watching you and giving you advice on how
[3041.66 --> 3046.86]  to therapy the person that's that's gotta be that's ethical that's fine yeah that is that is ethical
[3046.86 --> 3052.70]  that's the word i was gonna use i gotta i got a another stupid true story for you here i just to
[3052.70 --> 3059.90]  show you how much i don't understand anything i uh like a couple years back i got an email from somebody
[3059.90 --> 3065.98]  who was like like i knew through it was like a childhood friend's sister or something like like you know
[3065.98 --> 3069.74]  who i i know who they are it wasn't like weird that they would email me but it's like not someone
[3069.74 --> 3077.18]  i ever emailed with and they were like hey i was wondering like i have a friend who recently got laid
[3077.18 --> 3084.06]  off in the like in tech and i was wondering if like maybe you could help them like find a new job
[3084.06 --> 3090.78]  somewhere right i know you're out there in uh in the seattle area right and i know you do like a lot of
[3090.78 --> 3095.90]  programming stuff and you're well known and all this stuff so you know in their mind that means
[3095.90 --> 3100.22]  that you like i i assume that means that they think you like hang out with all of the managerial
[3100.22 --> 3105.66]  people or whatever so they're like so i'm like uh who like what is the what's the thing and they're
[3105.66 --> 3109.50]  like well this that they're uh they're a certified scrum master
[3109.50 --> 3119.42]  and i'm like i'm like i don't know what that is like do they know anything like do they know
[3119.42 --> 3125.10]  anything that does something like i'm like can they progress they do anything like no they're just
[3125.10 --> 3129.82]  a certified scrum master and i'm just like i was like i can't help you like i mean the only people i
[3129.82 --> 3134.14]  hang out with program for a living like i don't know i don't even know what a certified scrum master
[3134.14 --> 3139.74]  is i don't even know what i don't even know how you would certify someone to do that thing because
[3139.74 --> 3144.54]  the only thing i know about it is that some people just stand around and talk for like 15 minutes so
[3145.18 --> 3149.50]  do you guys want to tell me what that would mean how do you get certified to be a scrum master
[3150.30 --> 3156.62]  what is this what is a scrum master have you heard of the game no i mean so casey the main way
[3156.62 --> 3163.66]  is they have to like and subscribe on this podcast okay okay i was gonna say remember chat everyone if you
[3163.66 --> 3167.50]  do someone says they're a scrum master i do this every time you can save a lot of hardeck this way
[3167.50 --> 3172.22]  ask for their credentials they say they're certified say i want to see the certification what's your badge
[3172.22 --> 3179.50]  number like there's a lot of fakes out there all right and i will i will not take a ticket from
[3179.50 --> 3183.74]  anyone unless i see their certification that's just how i operate okay because they could just be
[3183.74 --> 3189.50]  impersonating a scrum master they could be it's a big problem it could be a scrum novice felony but it
[3189.50 --> 3195.98]  still happens i mean that's the that is the scary world we live in so what does the scrum master do
[3195.98 --> 3201.82]  guys like what do they what does that mean just a second vegan by the way you don't have any like uh
[3201.82 --> 3207.74]  what's it called like filter on your microphone so this whole time i can oh oh sorry chat like
[3207.74 --> 3212.06]  it's asmr do it deeply and i can't someone made a comment about it now i can't stop hearing you
[3212.06 --> 3217.74]  breathe it took you an hour to decide to tell them yeah thanks for telling me now i did an audio test
[3217.74 --> 3221.02]  before this and listen to myself breathe for a while and i was like that's kind of pleasant
[3224.06 --> 3229.74]  guys i will not breathe anymore okay yeah we were reminding chat they i know they were holding their
[3229.74 --> 3235.26]  breath during the story but it's a subliminal thing to remind them to breathe during the story of jake and
[3235.26 --> 3241.42]  tom chat i'm doing the tazan day from now on it doesn't work because my mic goes with me but okay
[3241.42 --> 3247.42]  we'll figure this out chat i'll mute um all right so uh to explain the scrum master so i've i've worked
[3247.42 --> 3251.98]  with a certified scrum master on many levels and in fact was so scrum mastery that they actually
[3251.98 --> 3257.90]  went out and taught other scrum masters how to scrum master okay so i clearly asked the right person
[3257.90 --> 3265.74]  because not only can you tell me the the truth straight from a scrum master but from a scrum master
[3265.74 --> 3273.90]  master master exactly okay um okay so i'm not gonna say any names just so i don't get anybody in
[3273.90 --> 3278.94]  trouble but and the rest of this podcast has been that way yeah i know so well except for the part
[3278.94 --> 3286.06]  where you're talking about the functions everybody knew the name guys i was trying not to create drama
[3286.06 --> 3291.74]  i intentionally didn't talk about this thing drama casey you were good oh no no there's definitely videos
[3291.74 --> 3296.22]  being made right now i'm sorry it's already happening casey it's he doesn't even know what
[3296.22 --> 3302.54]  a school master is okay so yeah and that's a true story so this is i'm gonna just i'm gonna tell you
[3302.54 --> 3307.58]  my definition of a scrum master this is not the official definition of a scrum master this is what i
[3307.58 --> 3313.10]  believe one to be after working with one of the pinnacle scrum masters out there okay which is the
[3313.10 --> 3322.46]  following that a scrum master is closer to a team therapist slash technical manager than anything
[3322.46 --> 3327.66]  else so a they meet with people to make sure everyone's working together well make sure things
[3327.66 --> 3332.70]  are actually moving making sure that we're sizing our tasks correctly kind of keeping up to date that
[3332.70 --> 3341.58]  our team is adhering to agile principles in a very like sound way sound uh way and then b they also help
[3341.58 --> 3345.10]  a lot with a lot of the technical direction they're not technically technical managers they're not
[3345.10 --> 3349.02]  the ones that's supposed to be making all the tickets and doing things but they often fall into this role
[3349.34 --> 3354.70]  and that was my experience was just like yeah but like how do you feel like i got a lot of that
[3354.70 --> 3361.66]  and so it truly was this code this this this mentor person this is kind of how i experienced actually you
[3361.66 --> 3366.94]  when when you said they're called scrum masters you weren't even really joking like you actually that's
[3366.94 --> 3372.30]  kind of what they kind of have to do a little bit if they're good if they're good if you had a manager
[3372.86 --> 3378.86]  that was aloof a scrum manager like how i kind of took it is that this the scrub master is kind of like
[3379.50 --> 3383.58]  it's what the manager should do to all of his employees which is like check in and make sure
[3383.58 --> 3388.86]  everyone's doing okay and that we're not running off the rails but instead of the manager that i worked
[3388.86 --> 3393.34]  with was uh he would often just like rewrite part of our app over the weekend and was just always on
[3393.34 --> 3398.30]  just coding benders and they were always crazy and sometimes they caused so much conflict that i i've
[3398.30 --> 3403.82]  had to delete like a week's worth of work wow just because and then one time he got super jacked up
[3403.82 --> 3408.30]  on promises but he like inlined his promises so i followed his pattern because i i didn't know what
[3408.30 --> 3412.54]  promises were this was like 2011 so i was like had like then and next functions that i was doing it
[3412.54 --> 3415.66]  was crazy because he was just like this is what we're doing we're doing promises so i was like all
[3415.66 --> 3420.86]  right we're doing promises everybody it was jacked up on promises dude i got jacked up on mountain
[3420.86 --> 3425.66]  doing promises and said what the hell were you doing i was like i don't know i'm just following
[3425.66 --> 3431.66]  what my my boss told me to do i had kind of a rough childhood my dad used to come home late at night
[3431.66 --> 3441.10]  all jacked up on promises it's like then and next he's like why are my kids never asynchronous you know
[3441.10 --> 3447.10]  it's just it's just they're not even true threads
[3451.10 --> 3453.90]  dad you never love both of us it's always one of us at a time why can't
[3453.90 --> 3463.98]  also i know we're definitely in the uh random portion of of the podcast right now but i do have
[3463.98 --> 3468.62]  to describe something happened yesterday because i spent yesterday serving coffee and telling people
[3468.62 --> 3476.30]  about sshing into a uh coffee website for normies for a seven hours straight uh i will say um can i
[3476.30 --> 3482.22]  share the picture with the girl that's you have to share the picture chat well do we have people's
[3482.22 --> 3486.54]  permission to share their picture you can show it on street street they're all content creators everyone
[3486.54 --> 3491.42]  okay fair enough just making sure just okay so technically i wasn't there okay so prime's gonna show
[3491.42 --> 3496.14]  us guys this is an actual photo from yesterday this is 100 real you're never gonna believe me but
[3496.14 --> 3501.26]  we have multiple witnesses what message or terminal chat this terminal chat so basically what you're
[3501.26 --> 3505.98]  saying is this was ai generated it's not what you're basically telling me whatever whatever i'm about
[3505.98 --> 3510.62]  to see which i don't actually know what it is my favorite picture in the universe i can't believe so
[3510.62 --> 3518.06]  this is at guys this is a real photo of me showing people ordering coffee in a terminal i swear to that's
[3518.06 --> 3523.58]  what's on the screen i am literally i'm holding the last and i go okay ladies watch this so first you all have
[3523.58 --> 3529.26]  max open terminal hit command spacebar type t you got a terminal you'll see it right there press enter
[3529.26 --> 3535.98]  ssh terminal.shop boom there and i showed him and that was actually taken from that moment that is
[3535.98 --> 3543.10]  real i promise you this will never happen again this is the first one i have a question wild women with
[3543.10 --> 3549.34]  ssh skills literally happened like it arch boys be careful that was that was by the end of the day so i
[3549.34 --> 3552.70]  practiced the pitch 40 times because in the beginning you're like so how do you buy the coffee oh you
[3552.70 --> 3560.70]  guys can't okay i gotta work better on this i gotta get like this is not working so by the end i had a
[3560.70 --> 3565.82]  doubt i was showing him you can't but i'll teach you show you all have also you all have max and holding
[3565.82 --> 3569.90]  a mac was working really well they were like of course we do and i said this app's already on your
[3569.90 --> 3573.74]  computer they go it really is i go it really is right now and
[3576.46 --> 3585.18]  yes casey so since everyone else got to plug all of their stuff uh i i kind of want to do an extended
[3585.18 --> 3592.22]  plug for terminal.shop here uh because i i legitimately have a question about it okay which is
[3592.22 --> 3600.14]  at least i am a lousy business person so maybe that is the answer to the question that i'm about
[3600.14 --> 3608.94]  to ask but in my mind when i hear like you can just order something from the terminal i'm like you guys
[3608.94 --> 3613.66]  are going to be rich i'm just like you're like that's going to be so freaking cool because two
[3613.66 --> 3620.70]  reasons one it's super novel and you people would tell each other that and two the only people in the
[3620.70 --> 3626.46]  world who have any money anymore are people who do use terminals because they freaking stole all the
[3626.46 --> 3632.38]  money and they have all the money now so my assumption is that this would be the perfect
[3632.38 --> 3637.74]  business thing but for some reason i don't get the sense that you guys are now the world's number
[3637.74 --> 3643.90]  one coffee supplier so what why do you suck at marketing well there's my there's my actual question
[3643.90 --> 3649.10]  what is wrong with you crazy did you just see we're on the streets going one at a time with people
[3649.10 --> 3655.18]  here's the key we do not want to have losers drinking our coffee we're starting with top
[3655.18 --> 3659.82]  quality people who are the coolest people in the world who run the world programmers obviously start
[3659.82 --> 3665.50]  with coolest people programmers after we get programmers then we'll start individually selecting
[3665.50 --> 3670.06]  other people in and then after that we'll go starbucks but you got to have a cool base of people
[3670.06 --> 3675.26]  like every programmer i know drinks this coffee what is it you can't have it we do that for four or five
[3675.26 --> 3680.94]  years okay people are like i want it so bad and goes you're too dumb then we sell it to them after
[3680.94 --> 3684.86]  we sell a big portion to some sort of like private equity firm you know black rock or something like
[3684.86 --> 3688.62]  that so i see so basically what you're saying is you're doing like the facebook model it's like oh
[3688.62 --> 3694.30]  you wanted to be on this you can't be on it yet like it's right only invite only for this coffee i see
[3694.86 --> 3698.22]  no but really like what's going on guys like what's going on what's wrong with i'll give you
[3698.22 --> 3703.50]  you got the real answer i do i do real answer what's the real answer the real answer even though
[3703.50 --> 3710.30]  it's going to sound like in another ad is just we'd rather ship like small batch coffee that's really
[3710.94 --> 3715.10]  good which is just hard to ship to a lot of people and like to a lot of places
[3715.10 --> 3720.14]  like supply constrained basically yes we can we're not in any other place but the us even though i know
[3720.14 --> 3726.62]  europe would go hard yep you know we have to be careful about stuff right so that's i mean that's the main
[3726.62 --> 3731.90]  the main thing i mean maybe over the next year we have uh we have started working a lot more on the
[3731.90 --> 3737.66]  on the coffee side of stuff in the past like three months probably and being a bit more uh a bit more
[3737.66 --> 3744.46]  serious about it but yeah i mean that's like the the major is just like i don't know how to get a
[3744.46 --> 3755.74]  roaster in the eu that wants to interface with a custom like sass b2b slash b2c coffee experience where we
[3755.74 --> 3762.06]  like ship them addresses and then you know so it's like that's the we're so we're getting there but
[3762.06 --> 3765.74]  that's honestly like we figured out something part of it yeah we figured out something pretty dark which
[3765.74 --> 3771.90]  is apparently uh taking people's public keys is against gdrp so we have a big issue to get around
[3771.90 --> 3775.90]  so whatever i said gd gldpr whatever glp1
[3775.90 --> 3782.06]  we all know what it is you can't just throw an l of that one glp1 i like that
[3783.02 --> 3786.62]  but once we get the legislation once the legislation's changed we're going to be rich in europe okay
[3786.62 --> 3791.90]  let's just yeah yeah yeah we're currently lobbying the eu and then we're going to sell all of the
[3791.90 --> 3797.34]  public keys to blackrock like that is the ultimate dude dude chat checkmate i'm so excited if you guys
[3797.34 --> 3802.70]  didn't see when the when uh the coffee first went live in hacker news it was like number one in
[3802.70 --> 3806.30]  hacker news that was one of the comments when someone's like why are they collecting the public
[3806.30 --> 3811.34]  keys they're just you're just giving them your public keys for free everyone idiots don't you know
[3811.34 --> 3816.94]  the plan they're harvesting public keys which we all got together and said who can we sell these to
[3818.22 --> 3824.38]  apparently there's a buyer out there i got in the dark web i could find no one we were so confused
[3824.38 --> 3830.46]  because we were trying to figure out is there something you can do with these i thought for sure there's
[3830.46 --> 3838.06]  nothing you can do with the the public key of an ssh key pair i'm like i don't understand isn't that
[3838.06 --> 3843.50]  kind of why we call it the public key is because the public is supposed to be able to have it
[3844.06 --> 3846.46]  but it was like we're just so ready
[3848.06 --> 3852.06]  we called sam alden right away and was like do you want to buy some public keys and he was like
[3852.06 --> 3858.06]  stop calling his number we called up mr blackrock and was just like mr blackrock we got a deal you
[3858.06 --> 3862.22]  cannot resist it involves people information he's like i'm listening and they're like public keys and
[3862.22 --> 3869.98]  he hung up on hundreds of public keys hundreds yeah it could cross a thousand yeah all right
[3869.98 --> 3876.22]  well this has been oh i had one i had one last thing yeah just really quick uh casey's story earlier
[3876.22 --> 3882.54]  reminded me of an ancient proverb from sun tzu you guys might have heard of him before and it goes a
[3882.54 --> 3890.70]  little bit something like this which is some days you do the j dieseling and other days you get j dieseled
[3891.26 --> 3897.34]  sun tzu art of war yep so i just wanted to make sure we got that one out there i really wanted to say
[3897.34 --> 3903.34]  that line and you guys kept interrupting where casey was doing that so thanks that's all i had to say
[3903.34 --> 3908.86]  that's the end of the stand-up see you guys next the name is the stand-up
