[0.00 → 7.28] I'm going to tell the greatest story ever to Casey, and he is gonna he is going to be the happiest person after hearing this
[12.00 → 18.96] Uh, anyway, I'm sorry now this all started because Casey was explaining a build process he made for rad, right?
[18.96 → 25.74] Am I correct on that for rad game tools, and it was an it was terrible, and it ruined, and they're still using it to this day
[25.74 → 31.88] And it's still awful. He recreated pre-processor macros, but with a build system is what it sounded like to me
[31.88 → 36.78] It's just like hey, we're going to do imports but with with with comments
[36.78 → 46.36] Whatever you're imagining right now. It was worse, right? Whatever the worst build system is you can imagine
[46.36 → 48.46] I paid one that was worse
[48.46 → 52.38] So I've had I, and I've experienced some pretty bad build system
[52.38 → 55.50] So that's that's something to be said right there, but I've never experienced it in the sea world
[55.50 → 60.06] So this has to be a new level of magic. Yeah, it was pretty great magic. I'm sorry
[60.06 → 60.62] All right
[60.62 → 61.74] All right, yes
[61.74 → 62.94] Garfield big Garfield
[62.94 → 69.26] So anyway, this reminded us of the story of tom now you may not be familiar with this Casey, but tom I'm not
[69.98 → 72.54] He's a genius, and we're talking about
[73.18 → 77.90] Super level pro like protégé level super genius
[77.90 → 83.02] Okay, this guy is the smartest man in the room in any room. He's in, and who is this?
[83.02 → 86.62] How do you know this tom or oh, we're going to get there Casey, okay?
[86.94 → 88.86] Lore has been written about tom, okay?
[88.86 → 94.54] That's all you know is that there's stories on stories about tom being a super genius
[96.06 → 99.98] All right, but the story I'm really going to tell is actually about a kid named Jake
[99.98 → 106.06] And he's not a genius like it by all accounts people would not consider Jake a genius
[106.78 → 108.30] But this is Jake's run-in
[108.78 → 109.34] with tom
[109.98 → 111.26] the literal genius
[112.06 → 112.30] Now
[113.26 → 120.46] Obviously Jake if you're not familiar Jake just got a job, and he got a job working on some brand-new technologies, and he was very excited
[120.46 → 125.10] He was young. He was an intern. It's at an unnamed company. So we don't get to know those details
[125.10 → 127.10] But it's with node
[127.10 → 132.22] Jason the web we're talking about some cutting-edge stuff back in the early, you know
[132.22 → 138.94] 20 tens, okay people were excited. I can see TJ over there already doing the give me a deal. Okay, he was oh, yeah
[138.94 → 143.82] You got JavaScript running on the server. My venture capital wallets are burning
[143.82 → 145.26] Exactly
[145.26 → 148.22] So on on on his first day
[148.22 → 153.34] He was talking with one of the non-technical members kind of getting set up and at the very end of the
[153.34 → 158.70] Conversation after explaining how excited he is they made a really odd comment, which was said uh, well
[159.18 → 162.38] You know the good news is everything we do is built on SVN
[163.10 → 165.98] It's going to be great. You're going to love it. And so he's like, oh, okay
[167.26 → 170.14] Sure, I don't I don't really know what that means but whatever for those by the way
[170.38 → 172.62] I know I have a lot of boomers in chat SVN
[173.34 → 178.70] Is like a predecessor to get is probably the easiest way to explain it. I don't want to go into any more details
[179.34 → 182.14] This is so super virgin nix users
[182.14 → 184.86] It's super virgin nix users
[184.86 → 187.10] All right
[187.10 → 191.42] Well, so let's go into part one. Are you ready for this one?
[191.82 → 199.58] Jason based domain specific language so he gets thrust into a project and the project uses something called j diesel
[199.58 → 202.30] His boss says don't worry take the next couple of weeks
[202.30 → 207.82] I want you to just become familiar with the project and uh, you probably you can ask for help
[208.30 → 210.30] But honestly given your background
[210.30 → 213.42] You're not even going to need to ask for help. You got this
[213.42 → 217.42] Now can I just pause for one second here and point out that me?
[217.98 → 218.94] I
[218.94 → 219.98] already
[219.98 → 221.02] love
[221.02 → 222.70] everything about this because
[222.70 → 226.14] Jay diesel is such a good acronym
[226.70 → 228.14] I am like
[228.14 → 230.86] Like I love it like I
[230.86 → 235.58] Should have named something that I will try to make it there 's's
[236.22 → 237.42] Sorry
[237.42 → 238.70] I was muted. I was muted. I
[238.70 → 239.42] You
[239.42 → 243.10] I forgot I was muted. Okay, I was going to make the comments
[243.10 → 245.90] Sorry, there's someone definitely at the jersey shore named j diesel right now
[245.90 → 250.06] Yes, that's exactly what I'm thinking I'm like hey, what's up j diesel?
[250.38 → 254.94] Like it's so good. Okay, you do one of those like those claps where you hit
[254.94 → 256.14] He's just got out of the j diesel
[256.14 → 262.30] It goes on for like seven years, and you're like when are you guys going to stop saying hello like yeah, okay
[262.86 → 267.26] If I could be that cool, I could never be that cool. Obviously being new at the company
[267.26 → 269.26] What's the first thing you do?
[269.26 → 271.26] Well, you download tortoise SVN
[272.78 → 274.06] Okay, walk
[274.06 → 280.62] Or thought it's or thought it was all this time. It's a tail as it really is and you uh
[281.58 → 283.10] You get the project you check it out
[283.10 → 286.14] But something happened when he checked out the project
[287.98 → 291.26] Estimated time of completion two days what?
[292.38 → 295.82] Wait, hold on. So just for the record
[296.78 → 300.62] Like all the witness Jonathan blow will be on tomorrow
[301.18 → 304.14] Yeah, all of that was checked into SVN
[304.78 → 312.70] That's a giant 3d game the whole thing. How did they make it take two days to check out something from tortoise SVN?
[313.10 → 316.86] Uh, Casey, it's called the weekend like don't you know like every Friday
[317.82 → 319.82] Check out see you guys on Monday
[320.86 → 325.82] All right, okay, all right. They didn't call it hair SVN. Okay, you got to make sure you take it out
[326.30 → 332.14] But low and steady wins the race. Okay, it's not that slow. So what have what's going on here Jake?
[332.46 → 333.34] Well, you know, date
[333.34 → 335.82] That's a great question because Jake had the exact same question
[335.82 → 339.98] He went to his co-worker and was just like man. This is taking two days. Am I doing something wrong?
[339.98 → 346.14] Yeah, uh, should I not use tortoise like well, what do I do here, and they said oh no, this is actually this is expected
[346.14 → 347.26] This is very normal
[347.90 → 349.90] You should just play solitaire
[350.46 → 356.78] So solitaire he did and solitaire he continued and solitaire all the way to the end
[356.78 → 359.90] It's pretty nice, right?
[359.90 → 361.98] It's a good first week time
[361.98 → 366.14] Oh, yeah, that's a good first week is all you know what I mean like that's nice
[366.14 → 371.42] He's rolling. He has the project. He's making inroads with co-workers. Furthermore, he's feeling pretty good
[371.42 → 375.82] And so now's the time for him to shine. He's young. Furthermore, he's impressionable
[375.82 → 378.78] He's ready to put in the hours burn the midnight oil
[379.34 → 383.10] So he's going to open up a random file, okay?
[384.30 → 387.42] But when he opens up the random file, he notices there are no comments
[388.38 → 395.02] There's nothing with it. He starts looking at a bunch of these weird Jason files trying to figure out what the heck's going on
[395.74 → 399.58] He doesn't get this he what is this what Casey? What is this?
[399.58 → 402.14] That's that's looking
[403.34 → 405.74] I don't know what that is the know
[406.38 → 407.98] Push the stack not a genius
[407.98 → 413.26] I don't want to interrupt this but I'll just say that functions 899 900 901
[413.98 → 416.86] I want to talk about that later because I got
[417.50 → 423.50] A mini rant we can talk about after that. So I'm remembering I'm remembering that functions array right there
[423.90 → 425.34] Okay, keep going
[425.34 → 426.30] Keep it going roll
[426.30 → 432.30] And then he opened up related files that had the same kind of name like customers Jason versus
[433.10 → 436.30] Customer.js, and you just see it filled with a bunch of stuff
[437.02 → 441.58] But there are no comments anywhere nobody has left any breadcrumbs
[441.58 → 448.62] And there's all these function calls and things that are just making no sense. Nothing seems to be complete every file is completely
[448.62 → 452.22] Just filled with stuff that doesn't seem to exist
[452.46 → 455.02] And it was very, very confusing for him
[456.70 → 457.74] So this is Jake
[458.86 → 464.22] He has to do something that none of us want to do when we first landed a job, and we just opened the code base
[464.22 → 470.06] We have to go to our co-worker, and we're going to have to ask for help and just look
[470.46 → 476.06] Like an idiot right off the bat like I can't even read the project help me read the project. So of course
[477.10 → 480.70] He goes to his co-worker, and he goes hey, man, I need some help
[480.70 → 485.02] I need you to kind of help me with what's happening this project because I feel genuinely confused
[485.02 → 487.02] I'm confused
[487.02 → 492.14] Oh, hold on. Sorry. I clicked the wrong page. This is while Jake was working on batman
[493.58 → 496.70] 2 or something. I don't I'm just looking at Jake here. It was a while ago
[497.34 → 503.90] It was a while back. Yeah, it was a much earlier marvel film. Yeah, okay. Oh, sorry DC. Oh, sorry
[503.90 → 506.06] So his co-worker was like you just don't get it yet
[506.62 → 508.62] See the thing is that j diesel
[508.86 → 513.90] It was written by tom, and he's a super genius, and he wrote j diesel all by himself
[514.86 → 519.34] And so basically that customers dot Jason file is just metadata used to put together
[520.22 → 521.18] the customer class
[521.98 → 524.22] And then he waited for Jake to get it
[525.98 → 527.26] Jake did not get it in fact
[529.10 → 529.82] Jake did not
[530.70 → 536.06] So then he asked the only what's the next most logical question if you don't understand how code works
[536.54 → 538.86] And you can't just simply read it and understand it. What's your most
[539.26 → 541.26] What's the most logical conclusion you can do?
[541.26 → 542.54] Ask JLPT
[542.54 → 544.54] Yes, didn't exist
[544.54 → 548.22] It didn't exist at this time. It didn't it didn't exist vegan. What do you mean?
[548.22 → 548.78] Ask Jeeves
[551.18 → 556.38] Well, of course you ask well, how do I run it? I'm just going to debug it. I'm going to figure some things out
[557.02 → 558.46] Well, Scott laughed
[558.46 → 562.30] Okay, his co-worker laughed right as his face and said you wouldn't want to just run it
[562.30 → 566.46] It takes a couple of days for a new deployment to finish starting up
[566.46 → 568.46] Jay diesel can be a little slow
[568.46 → 572.46] Slow, but it's really powerful like super powerful
[572.46 → 573.50] Like I said tom
[573.50 → 575.50] He's a genius
[575.50 → 577.50] What is going on?
[577.50 → 579.50] This is nuts
[579.50 → 583.98] How do you think Jake feels right now? Okay, he's confused too
[586.14 → 586.78] Part two
[586.78 → 588.38] Jay diesel
[589.18 → 589.82] In action
[589.82 → 591.82] I hope you guys are ready
[591.82 → 593.82] I hope you guys are ready
[593.82 → 597.82] If this isn't a jersey shore scene I would be so pissed this needs to be something
[597.82 → 599.82] He's at the beach pumping iron
[599.82 → 602.78] You know I'm not going to do jersey shore bacon. You know it's against my religion. We already know this
[602.78 → 606.70] Oh, I also feel like j diesel kind of reminds me of Vin Diesel
[606.70 → 610.14] So I'm wondering if it does this thing have a nickname like triple x or anything?
[610.14 → 615.98] You know what? It would be good, but it's all about family here. Okay, okay, c okay
[616.54 → 618.30] It's all about family
[619.66 → 623.98] So Jake and his confusion he did the next most likely thing you should do
[626.62 → 628.94] That's a real Jake that's a real Jake
[630.62 → 635.42] So what did you do well, he asked his co-worker can you at least walk me through
[635.42 → 638.86] What's going on because I am confused?
[639.98 → 642.14] Well, his co-worker he laughed again
[643.98 → 645.42] These young guys
[645.42 → 651.26] All right, so the genius part this is the genius part you know where it says class can you see that right there in the Jason file?
[651.82 → 653.02] Okay, good
[653.02 → 655.02] Well, that's the class name
[655.02 → 658.70] As you can see that's how this works and now do you see where it says functions?
[659.74 → 660.54] Yes, those
[660.54 → 665.66] Those are subversion links to all the functions that make up that class
[667.82 → 668.22] What
[668.22 → 672.78] That's precisely what Jake said he said
[673.50 → 678.78] I don't quite get this, but I fear that I might get this, and I don't want it to be true
[678.78 → 685.58] Yeah, I'm more I'm less scared about me having gotten that wrong than I am about me having gotten that right
[686.78 → 687.82] Precisely yeah
[687.82 → 691.66] So his co-worker seeing Jake remain confused was like okay
[691.66 → 695.74] So you see how you have that customers.Jason and the customers.js file?
[695.74 → 700.30] The Jason file is the metadata and the JS file has the code
[700.30 → 706.38] So you so the list of functions in the Jason file tells j diesel to look up those revisions
[706.78 → 709.58] Of the JS file to find what functions are available
[709.58 → 715.10] And in that case the actual code and the revisions are located at SVN revision 568
[715.66 → 716.54] 899
[716.54 → 718.06] 900
[718.06 → 719.18] 901
[720.14 → 721.42] And the list keeps on going
[721.42 → 722.54] What
[722.54 → 725.26] Now hold on before you speak
[725.82 → 731.98] I don't Jake stop being confused. I'm trying to finish this up here each revision of the customer JS has one
[732.46 → 734.46] function
[734.46 → 740.70] So to add all functions you have to check all you have to do is check in your new code with the updated Jason metadata
[741.26 → 742.62] file with the new revisions
[743.66 → 752.14] Whenever something makes a function call to the customer object j diesel uses the list of function revisions to check out all the actual functions
[752.78 → 753.90] Until it finds a match
[754.54 → 755.50] Do you understand it now?
[757.50 → 758.54] Yes, I
[759.34 → 759.58] Do
[761.74 → 763.74] And I'm mildly terrified
[765.18 → 765.74] Oh well
[765.74 → 766.70] Can I just ask
[767.90 → 769.10] One quick question
[769.82 → 772.06] Uh, what's the name of my co-worker again?
[772.06 → 774.22] Sorry, I forget his name is Scott
[774.22 → 774.54] Scott
[775.74 → 778.46] If you're asking this kind of questions Casey you're really behind
[778.46 → 779.74] Okay, yes
[779.74 → 781.02] So far behind, okay
[781.82 → 782.62] So Scott
[784.14 → 785.10] I just
[785.10 → 788.70] Want to know when you say subversion revision number
[789.26 → 793.02] Do you literally mean that if I were to go fix
[793.66 → 795.34] say a bug in
[796.06 → 799.02] Revision 902 in this list for example
[799.34 → 802.62] And I checked it in, and it became revision 3157
[803.18 → 807.02] I would have to go into this list and replace 902
[807.58 → 809.10] With 3157
[809.66 → 815.66] Otherwise, it would continue to use the old code that I had rechecked in a replacement for already
[816.46 → 821.58] You know, our manager did tell me that we had a hot new gun in here that could really pick up the project
[821.82 → 824.70] And it sounds like you are really understanding your stuff
[825.42 → 825.50] Oh
[825.50 → 825.90] No
[827.98 → 829.82] Casey you were built for this bro
[829.82 → 831.34] You were literally built for this
[831.34 → 831.66] Casey
[831.66 → 832.78] Jay diesel
[832.78 → 834.22] No, I'm confused this
[834.22 → 837.10] This is fine Casey. Are you committing more than one function at a time?
[838.22 → 838.70] That's
[838.70 → 842.14] Well, even if I am only committing one function at a time
[842.14 → 847.98] So now I have to check in also the other I have to check in both files every time
[847.98 → 852.70] And of course multiple people might have to check in this file
[853.50 → 855.90] Because they're updating different functions
[856.78 → 857.58] Oh, first
[857.58 → 863.02] Casey you tell us you don't like clean code, and now you're telling us you don't like clean revision
[863.02 → 864.46] I know man
[864.46 → 865.98] I don't know
[865.98 → 866.94] Wow, okay
[866.94 → 871.10] Well, let's do this. Keep going jay diesel. Let's lets uh
[871.66 → 873.90] This is like the chronicles of ridiculous
[873.90 → 875.02] Well, anyway
[875.90 → 878.62] Jake had the same response. He just said I
[879.98 → 880.62] Think so
[881.26 → 881.58] Yeah
[882.62 → 886.62] And his co-worker of course just said like I said tom he's a genius
[886.94 → 888.30] Okay, you see tom right here
[888.86 → 892.54] Yeah, man, he's a genius this lets you track every function that has ever
[893.18 → 898.38] Existed you can add new functions by overwriting a JS file and adding a new revision to the Jason
[898.38 → 901.18] You can remove a function just by removing its revision number
[901.18 → 906.70] From the function list, and it's still there in history inactive, but never lost
[908.54 → 910.70] Scott stood let me know if you have any more questions
[910.70 → 911.66] He left
[911.66 → 912.78] Jake's test
[918.62 → 921.66] Part three rise and grinds
[921.66 → 925.34] Oh, this is about they started a terminal based coffee company
[927.66 → 930.38] That's actually what I was thinking when I made this TJ
[931.18 → 933.18] So
[934.22 → 937.74] For Jake no obstacles either big. He's young. Furthermore, he's virile
[937.74 → 941.10] He's ready to just go out there and absolutely
[942.54 → 943.18] Crush
[943.18 → 944.14] the universe
[945.02 → 950.62] And so of course as soon as he realizes as he starts inspecting the code and really starts combing through it that this is
[950.62 → 952.78] Actually just a simple web portal
[953.26 → 956.22] For customers to be able to update their personal information
[956.22 → 958.22] But thanks to the complexity of j diesel
[958.22 → 961.18] What should take minutes now takes days
[961.18 → 966.06] A true 10x engineer this tom fella is and so
[966.06 → 971.26] So of course Jake being a good citizen decides you know what?
[971.26 → 973.10] I can fix her
[973.10 → 976.94] I can get in here and I can make real changes that will help everybody
[976.94 → 981.18] So he started going through all the code familiarizing himself
[981.18 → 985.58] He started checking in a couple code comments letting people know what's going on
[986.14 → 990.38] Throughout the code and how they can kind of trace everything and even upon just looking at the code
[990.38 → 994.38] There was obvious bugs things that just will break
[994.38 → 998.46] So of course he started to even fix those check in new ones
[998.46 → 1002.22] Really making some amazing changes Jake
[1002.22 → 1004.14] Is a good citizen
[1004.14 → 1008.38] Common Jake w common Jake w absolutely amazing
[1008.38 → 1014.86] Part four
[1017.34 → 1017.66] Tom
[1019.18 → 1025.26] Is tom still at this fictional company that is definitely not a company that you any of you have ever worked at
[1025.26 → 1029.02] Casey he's the only one who knows how this works we cannot buy your top
[1029.50 → 1031.10] Jay diesel Casey
[1031.10 → 1033.26] I'm saying but is he still there or has he left
[1034.30 → 1038.22] Of this company we've never received an update from anybody who worked at this company
[1038.22 → 1039.34] At the time of this story
[1039.34 → 1041.42] At the time of the story at the time of the story
[1041.42 → 1043.50] Yes at the time of the story he was the lead engineer
[1044.30 → 1044.70] Okay
[1047.02 → 1047.50] All right
[1049.50 → 1050.38] That's fine
[1053.18 → 1061.26] Jake arrives Monday morning feeling great okay he has made a lot of changes he's done a lot of good work
[1061.74 → 1067.10] Wrapped up the previous week worked well into the weekend, and now he's arriving Monday morning
[1067.82 → 1069.74] But things were a miss things were odd
[1070.86 → 1073.42] People were running around people were freaking out
[1073.42 → 1081.34] Scott as you have recently learned his co-worker runs by and says the database got scrambled, and he just keeps on going
[1081.34 → 1085.42] People are freaking out people are trying to figure out stuff and all of a sudden Jake here's you
[1087.10 → 1089.42] And he turns around and sees tom
[1089.42 → 1093.90] And Tom says hey Jake you're Jake right the new guy
[1095.50 → 1095.74] Yeah
[1097.10 → 1097.58] I am
[1098.78 → 1101.42] What's going on you broke j diesel
[1101.42 → 1103.26] By the way my name's Tom
[1105.98 → 1107.02] And I'm a genius
[1107.02 → 1107.90] What
[1109.18 → 1111.18] Jake is confused what
[1112.30 → 1112.46] I
[1112.46 → 1113.18] I
[1113.18 → 1113.34] I
[1113.34 → 1115.02] I didn't I didn't I didn't do anything
[1115.02 → 1115.42] I
[1115.42 → 1117.26] How could I have broken it
[1118.30 → 1124.70] You broke j diesel I'm reporting you to the bosses and I'm having you fired and Tom's
[1125.26 → 1125.98] turned around
[1125.98 → 1129.26] And stormed off leaving Jake confused
[1130.46 → 1132.06] And Jake just sat there in silence
[1134.06 → 1135.02] What has happened
[1135.02 → 1139.90] How did I break everything
[1142.22 → 1142.86] Part five
[1143.82 → 1144.46] The meeting
[1145.18 → 1146.94] This is a perfect story by the way
[1147.74 → 1149.18] Thank you i didn't write it
[1149.18 → 1151.10] I'm full i really invested right now
[1151.98 → 1156.38] In the story of Jake like I'm like i need to know this conclusion
[1157.34 → 1158.70] Oh the conclusion
[1160.54 → 1165.18] Let's just say everything is just so beautiful it's so, so beautiful okay
[1166.70 → 1171.18] Well they have the grand meeting everybody gets there to have the grand meeting and discuss
[1172.30 → 1179.02] And one of the VPS turn and look Jake right in the ocular nerve and says tell us what you did to Jake
[1179.18 → 1179.50] Diesel
[1180.30 → 1184.54] Now Jake of course says i don't I don't think i did anything I've only been here for two weeks
[1185.18 → 1189.98] Trying to learn j diesel how the customer portal works i don't even i don't even know how to deploy it
[1191.90 → 1197.50] Tom interjects in there and says you made few commits to subversion he was very upset about this
[1197.50 → 1201.82] Right because some things obviously happened Jake did make some commits he made some comments he made some good stuff
[1201.98 → 1209.02] He said well, yes, I added a few code comments trying to tom just jumps right in and says
[1209.18 → 1214.86] You can't use comments and j diesel tom shouted that's what broke it
[1214.86 → 1219.66] No
[1219.66 → 1220.86] No
[1220.86 → 1221.82] No
[1221.82 → 1222.38] No
[1224.38 → 1225.26] Jake stayed silent
[1226.06 → 1227.42] He's just trying to process
[1227.42 → 1227.58] No
[1227.58 → 1227.74] No
[1228.30 → 1228.70] Don't
[1228.70 → 1229.02] This
[1229.02 → 1229.66] No
[1229.66 → 1231.02] This cannot be true
[1231.02 → 1232.14] Are you
[1232.14 → 1238.22] This is true as far as we know as far as we've done as far as we can tell Casey this is a real thing
[1238.78 → 1243.26] Casey if you write good code you shouldn't need comments all right my code self documenting
[1243.26 → 1244.06] Thank you
[1245.34 → 1246.22] Kind of code smell
[1246.78 → 1247.66] Yeah, it's honestly
[1248.54 → 1251.82] It's kind of a sign right now Casey kind of telling on yourself right now
[1253.90 → 1254.30] Okay
[1255.34 → 1257.42] He remains silent just trying to process
[1258.38 → 1260.86] How comments could wipe out a customer database
[1261.50 → 1264.14] All right, like tom continued after the pause
[1265.02 → 1268.38] I haven't added comment support to j diesel
[1269.10 → 1271.18] So the runtime executes
[1272.22 → 1274.22] Comments like normal code
[1274.94 → 1278.62] You must have had a couple database updates in the comments
[1279.34 → 1279.98] He asks
[1281.26 → 1285.02] Tom obviously being the genius zeros in on what could have been
[1285.82 → 1286.46] the problem
[1289.02 → 1289.42] What
[1290.14 → 1290.94] Jake of course
[1292.78 → 1294.22] He responds with well
[1294.22 → 1297.42] Yeah, I put a couple short syntax examples
[1297.42 → 1300.86] In a comment to clarify and then tom
[1301.34 → 1302.94] Bursts up onto his feet and says
[1302.94 → 1303.42] I
[1303.42 → 1304.62] knew it
[1305.34 → 1306.46] You broke it
[1306.46 → 1312.30] He turned to the VP and said I can't deal with coders who don't understand the system
[1312.30 → 1313.98] You either fire Jake
[1315.50 → 1316.46] or I quit
[1319.58 → 1320.70] Drops the microphone
[1320.70 → 1324.14] Leaves the meeting
[1324.14 → 1326.06] VP sitting there
[1326.62 → 1328.62] The upper crust of the management
[1329.18 → 1333.42] Baffled by Jake's decisions to take down the customer database
[1333.42 → 1337.98] So the VP representative
[1338.54 → 1340.70] And hr start talking right there in front of Jake
[1340.70 → 1342.06] They don't even act like he exists
[1342.06 → 1345.26] They just start talking about Jake as if he was sitting there
[1345.58 → 1349.66] And they say I think our only course of action here is pretty clear
[1350.62 → 1355.10] Tom is a programming virtuoso and our best resource
[1355.98 → 1358.22] And Jake just deleted the database
[1359.82 → 1361.10] We have to fire Jake
[1367.66 → 1369.42] So Jake went on to greener pastures
[1370.38 → 1371.26] He left the place
[1372.46 → 1375.02] Never to think about j diesel or tom again
[1375.02 → 1377.74] And now Jake lives a much happier life
[1378.38 → 1380.94] Programming in a regular code base that is not insane
[1382.06 → 1385.66] And that is the story of tom
[1387.26 → 1388.30] The super genius
[1388.86 → 1389.90] Tom's a genius
[1389.90 → 1392.78] Tom is in fact a genius
[1392.78 → 1393.90] Let's see it in chat
[1393.90 → 1394.86] Tom's a genius
[1394.86 → 1396.78] Tom is a genius
[1396.78 → 1400.94] This is going to end with and Tom's full name is
[1401.58 → 1403.26] Donald GitHub or something
[1403.26 → 1404.06] I don't know like
[1404.70 → 1407.42] Tom's full name the primo gen
[1407.42 → 1408.70] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[1408.70 → 1410.94] By the way, my name is Tom if you didn't know that
[1412.70 → 1414.14] My real name is Tom
[1414.70 → 1415.74] I just don't stream
[1415.74 → 1416.38] Thank you
[1417.66 → 1418.70] Tom Heifer
[1418.70 → 1421.10] All right, I wanted to read that
[1421.10 → 1422.30] I wanted to kind of give you that
[1423.18 → 1425.50] That a story because your your your build system
[1426.62 → 1431.66] It was comments that were executing code which just it reminded me of tom
[1431.66 → 1434.22] And prime we said there
[1434.22 → 1435.66] I don't remember if we said it
[1435.66 → 1441.82] We'll have to pull the footage or if Casey said it one of us said that either Casey you said I'm a genius when you were making it
[1441.82 → 1443.98] That's how you felt, or we said you were a genius
[1444.38 → 1449.58] And that's why we were saying that was like the next level connection to this story
[1449.58 → 1452.30] Yes, well if the only difference is
[1453.02 → 1455.02] Here that like uh
[1455.02 → 1459.98] Everyone was very embarrassed about it afterwards which doesn't seem to have happened to tom
[1461.02 → 1464.22] Tom is apparently just fine with it
[1464.22 → 1465.58] That's because Tom's a genius
[1465.58 → 1468.14] Tom is apparently a genius yes
[1469.02 → 1471.50] Honestly case though you should adopt some of these coding practices
[1471.50 → 1474.94] I would say get comments out of your code because I did read an announcement
[1474.94 → 1479.10] GitHub's going to announce next week. They will be charging more for comments in the code base
[1479.50 → 1482.62] So if you can just get into the good habit of removing them
[1482.62 → 1484.78] They're charging per line of code hosted
[1484.78 → 1487.34] Yeah per line of code hosted so every piece of documentation
[1487.34 → 1488.62] Per line of code hosted per minute of course
[1488.62 → 1490.14] It's a very confusing thing
[1491.18 → 1495.02] So I guess if I'm reading between the lines here
[1496.06 → 1497.82] And obviously since this is a
[1499.02 → 1504.46] Not a story certainly that happened to anyone here you're just recounting an abstract story about two people
[1505.58 → 1510.70] One named tom and one named Jake who don't have any connection to the real world in any way
[1510.70 → 1511.02] Correct
[1511.82 → 1512.62] Um
[1512.94 → 1515.26] It is kind of hard for me to
[1516.54 → 1519.90] Understand how that code was written
[1520.70 → 1522.46] Like so it
[1523.42 → 1525.74] The parser doesn't fail
[1526.54 → 1527.82] When it hits a comment
[1528.62 → 1530.70] It just ignores the comment
[1531.58 → 1533.58] And the parser is
[1533.58 → 1536.22] It's actually like someone re-implemented
[1536.22 → 1537.74] A JavaScript
[1538.30 → 1543.18] Runtime of their own because they're not using an existing one, or it would have handled comments
[1543.82 → 1546.30] So they re-implemented the JavaScript
[1548.22 → 1548.94] Runtime
[1550.22 → 1550.70] Parse
[1550.70 → 1553.02] It's its not you're making it entirely too hard
[1553.02 → 1553.82] Yeah, I am
[1553.82 → 1554.14] Casey
[1554.14 → 1555.74] Casey does
[1557.74 → 1559.10] Just answer me the simple question
[1559.10 → 1559.74] Yeah
[1559.74 → 1561.66] Does the line have selected on it?
[1563.82 → 1564.14] Okay
[1564.14 → 1564.94] So
[1564.94 → 1565.74] So
[1565.74 → 1572.06] Is what you're saying it basically just searches for the word select then takes everything to the end of the line and runs it or something like that?
[1572.06 → 1574.06] That's all I'm saying is hey
[1574.06 → 1574.30] Okay
[1574.30 → 1574.54] Okay
[1574.54 → 1575.74] If it has selected on it
[1575.74 → 1576.86] It's code
[1576.86 → 1578.62] That sounds like a database query to me
[1579.42 → 1579.74] Or
[1580.70 → 1584.22] Multi-line comments, and it's doing something line by line
[1584.22 → 1585.34] That's the other one
[1585.90 → 1587.18] That I think is pretty possible
[1587.18 → 1589.58] Guys let's be easy on Casey too
[1589.58 → 1590.30] Tom's a genius
[1590.30 → 1593.90] Casey's not going to understand his intricate system right away
[1593.90 → 1594.62] Yeah
[1594.62 → 1595.82] Okay, that's a good point
[1595.82 → 1596.22] That's a good point
[1596.22 → 1598.38] I can't just drop in here and ask you know
[1598.78 → 1602.06] These sort of pedestrian questions of a genius mind
[1603.18 → 1607.66] That is just way past any of us here on this podcast
[1607.66 → 1608.62] I agree with that
[1608.62 → 1609.02] This is
[1609.02 → 1611.18] I want to know what everyone's thoughts are
[1611.18 → 1616.70] What are the chances they had a singular backup at any time of production?
[1619.10 → 1620.14] I would assume no
[1620.14 → 1624.78] No, just based on the VP and everybody's reaction to the customer data being deleted
[1624.78 → 1626.54] That was a hard no right there
[1627.74 → 1628.70] I was going to say, so this is
[1628.70 → 1629.74] That would be so stressful
[1629.74 → 1632.54] This is one of those where someone's like this system's insane
[1632.54 → 1634.46] And you just hit him with uh, uh
[1634.46 → 1636.38] You want me to look up Chesterton's fence all right?
[1636.38 → 1638.38] There's a reason why all right?
[1638.38 → 1640.38] I don't have time to give you the lore
[1640.38 → 1640.94] Yeah
[1640.94 → 1643.10] But trust me it's there all right?
[1643.10 → 1643.74] Yeah
[1643.74 → 1645.26] We
[1645.26 → 1647.82] We use an uh
[1647.82 → 1651.98] We use a negative three negative two negative one backup strategy
[1652.78 → 1653.98] Uh for this
[1654.70 → 1660.46] And uh you know so that means if anything happens we just don't have any copies of the database anymore
[1661.42 → 1662.38] Yeah, see prime
[1662.38 → 1665.26] I see I would have been the guy that would have kept a backup earlier
[1665.26 → 1667.42] But then I found out in my young junior career
[1667.42 → 1672.54] The like security gets really mad when you make a backup of production database on your computer
[1672.54 → 1678.22] Like they hated I was like guys I'm being safe, and they said so all the real phone
[1678.22 → 1683.34] I'm, like yeah, the real phone number so what it's what if we accidentally lose the database?
[1683.34 → 1687.02] I have it, and they told me to get it off my computer and um
[1687.82 → 1690.78] Yeah, that uh big it that sounds actually really reasonable
[1692.38 → 1694.70] So what are you doing with that on your computer?
[1695.98 → 1697.02] Try to save the company
[1697.02 → 1703.02] I do want to I do want to put in some kind of way that we can do like a hard break here
[1703.66 → 1706.86] At some point because I want to talk about this
[1706.86 → 1712.30] This is actually somewhat of a more serious topic. I wanted to talk about that function array thing
[1712.30 → 1714.30] We'll do the hard break right here about this
[1714.30 → 1716.70] So I want to make a way that because what I'm well
[1717.26 → 1719.66] Meta talk about it first, too. So can we do a hard break?
[1719.66 → 1722.46] Yeah, yeah, let me just do a really quick very simple hard break
[1722.46 → 1729.02] Hey, if you're joining us on YouTube, you're going to have to listen to the full episode on Spotify link in the description
[1729.42 → 1734.78] Thanks for joining us at the stand-up. Thank you very much for having Casey vegan and TJ on the stand-up
[1735.02 → 1738.30] If you're not familiar with Casey's work check out computer enhance.com
[1738.94 → 1742.22] Also, we might post some of the clips on Stan on uh different channels
[1742.22 → 1744.38] So check that link in the description, too true
[1744.78 → 1745.74] So I
[1746.54 → 1753.34] I am going to try and say everything I'm about to say in the same kind of tom Jake way because I don't want
[1753.90 → 1754.70] to
[1754.70 → 1756.70] create any drama
[1756.70 → 1757.90] God
[1757.90 → 1760.06] Because this will wait for whatever this story is
[1760.38 → 1764.54] This will create this will create so much drama even probably me pseudonym this
[1765.10 → 1767.66] Because it's like it would be like YouTuber drama, right?
[1769.26 → 1771.26] Oh, I've seen some so I'm just gonna
[1771.26 → 1775.58] It's a shocking story when you get YouTuber drama primo gen quickly. We need a thumbnail
[1775.90 → 1779.58] Picture of tom he's done. Okay, two texts. He's done
[1783.34 → 1785.34] Red text on bottom
[1787.42 → 1789.42] You're fired
[1790.70 → 1792.86] So I don't watch
[1793.82 → 1795.82] Very much programming
[1796.14 → 1800.38] YouTube what I just don't right and the reason for that is
[1800.38 → 1801.82] Now you're kind of saying that lie
[1801.82 → 1803.18] It hurts a little bit
[1803.18 → 1805.18] Wow, Casey
[1805.18 → 1805.58] Sorry
[1806.94 → 1808.78] Uh, and the reason for that's pretty obvious, right?
[1808.78 → 1811.34] Like I just don't have time to do that
[1811.34 → 1814.94] So when I'm going to go watch YouTube, I watch something like
[1815.58 → 1817.98] Totally unrelated to work, right?
[1817.98 → 1819.98] I don't go watch programming YouTube
[1820.54 → 1824.86] Eddie, you know, I don't know I'm sure if I was younger like if you know when I was growing up
[1824.86 → 1828.54] I would have watched programming YouTube all the time because oh my god
[1828.54 → 1832.70] It's exactly what I missed when I was little like how do you do this?
[1832.70 → 1836.70] Or what are the real programmers doing like it's such an amazing resource
[1837.74 → 1838.78] When you're younger
[1838.78 → 1839.34] Thanks, Casey
[1839.34 → 1839.90] Thanks, Casey
[1839.90 → 1842.70] You don't need the post plays, okay?
[1842.70 → 1846.14] No, I'm serious. I'm dead serious when I was little
[1846.14 → 1847.90] This is what I would have loved right?
[1847.90 → 1850.70] But when you're older you're just like I'm going to go watch
[1851.26 → 1856.30] Freaking beard meets food or something like I'm going to go watch some guy eat go like to a restaurant
[1856.54 → 1862.14] And eat like 5 000 chicken wings and just because like I i don't want to you know
[1862.54 → 1866.14] If you work at the McDonald's you don't want to come home and eat a box of McNuggets, right?
[1866.14 → 1868.06] That's just how that sometimes works
[1868.62 → 1871.50] So anyway, I don't watch very much programming YouTube
[1871.50 → 1875.90] So I'm not necessarily always aware of all the things that are going on
[1877.02 → 1883.74] But a couple of months back there was some drama that I will not refer to specifically
[1885.02 → 1885.34] and
[1886.86 → 1893.90] One of the people involved with the drama is sort of in game development programming
[1895.58 → 1895.90] and
[1895.90 → 1899.10] a second YouTuber
[1899.10 → 1900.38] who
[1900.38 → 1903.58] sort of second YouTuber has hit the story
[1903.58 → 1905.10] I'm
[1905.10 → 1907.42] I'm dying on the inside like
[1907.42 → 1908.46] like
[1908.46 → 1909.90] a second YouTuber
[1910.94 → 1917.26] decides to sort of capitalize on the drama that's going on with this first YouTuber by
[1919.02 → 1922.70] doing like a code review of that person's code
[1922.70 → 1923.90] yeah, right now
[1925.26 → 1925.66] okay
[1926.78 → 1927.42] and now
[1927.42 → 1930.22] being the dick that I am
[1932.06 → 1934.38] I watched this video because I'm like
[1934.94 → 1942.30] all right like I'm gonna watch this guy does a code review because like I would be very snarky about most people's code reviews, right?
[1943.34 → 1947.58] so I watched this code review and one of the things that the person is like
[1947.58 → 1948.78] like
[1948.78 → 1951.42] he's like on a very high horse about
[1951.42 → 1953.42] the fact that this code
[1953.42 → 1954.14] has
[1954.14 → 1954.94] numbers
[1954.94 → 1956.70] like that function array in it
[1957.42 → 1958.46] to refer to
[1959.26 → 1959.74] like
[1959.74 → 1960.78] random things like
[1960.78 → 1961.34] oh, you know
[1961.34 → 1963.82] it's got number 328 is some
[1963.82 → 1966.54] index into a table of dialogue or something like that
[1966.54 → 1968.54] and the person's like
[1968.54 → 1969.34] this is just
[1969.34 → 1970.22] obviously
[1970.22 → 1973.50] demonstrates that this person has no idea what they're doing
[1973.50 → 1976.22] and couldn't possibly be a professional programmer
[1976.22 → 1979.02] and it's just a charlatan and a fraud and all these sorts of things
[1979.02 → 1980.06] and I just want
[1980.06 → 1982.70] I was wishing I had the button of like
[1982.70 → 1985.74] I can interject into other people's YouTube streams to just be like
[1986.54 → 1987.02] I'm like
[1987.58 → 1988.38] actually
[1989.74 → 1990.46] actually
[1990.46 → 1991.26] right
[1991.26 → 1992.38] hard actually
[1992.38 → 1993.98] hard actually
[1993.98 → 1994.86] I'm like
[1995.66 → 2003.42] if you are at the point in your career where you think an uncommented bare table of numbers
[2003.42 → 2008.62] showing up in the middle of code shows that someone isn't a professional programmer
[2009.66 → 2014.14] you're the person who isn't a professional programmer, right?
[2014.14 → 2015.26] you've never had to get
[2015.26 → 2016.94] every fucking code face
[2017.66 → 2019.74] has some shit like that in it
[2020.70 → 2024.30] and there's always an explanation, and it's always bad
[2024.30 → 2026.70] but that's what happens
[2026.70 → 2027.10] all right
[2027.10 → 2027.74] like
[2027.74 → 2029.42] that is what happens
[2029.42 → 2032.06] so actually it's the other way around
[2032.06 → 2034.06] like you're the novice
[2034.06 → 2036.30] and you're the one without the work experience
[2036.30 → 2038.22] if you look at something like that
[2038.22 → 2041.18] and say that it's like evidence that this is unshippable
[2041.18 → 2041.98] I'm like
[2041.98 → 2043.90] go to any freaking web cup
[2043.90 → 2044.70] go to google
[2044.70 → 2045.42] go to Amazon
[2045.42 → 2045.98] whatever
[2045.98 → 2048.14] we'll find that code for you my friend
[2048.14 → 2049.10] it's in there
[2049.50 → 2050.94] it's running the thing you're
[2050.94 → 2053.02] it's probably in YouTube's code base
[2053.02 → 2055.10] that you use to upload this
[2055.10 → 2056.38] has one of those in there
[2056.38 → 2056.70] all right
[2057.58 → 2059.98] so that's what that reminded me of when you saw that function
[2059.98 → 2060.62] I was like
[2060.62 → 2061.02] yup
[2061.02 → 2063.10] I know that list of numbers
[2063.10 → 2063.34] right
[2063.34 → 2064.22] yes
[2064.22 → 2064.70] anyway
[2064.70 → 2066.70] first off I do know the video you're talking about
[2066.70 → 2067.74] and I knew that
[2067.74 → 2074.86] I wasn't gonna I wasn't going to enjoy the video in any regards because at the beginning he pulls out books as his evidence for his authority
[2074.86 → 2078.06] it's just like one of those clean code
[2078.06 → 2078.78] and he's just like
[2078.78 → 2079.90] he just pulled out clean
[2079.90 → 2081.66] no he did not pull out clean code
[2081.66 → 2082.62] no
[2082.62 → 2087.74] it's just like brother that's a great that's like a crazy way to start anything be like I read books
[2087.74 → 2088.38] it was nuts
[2088.38 → 2089.02] you don't
[2089.02 → 2091.74] I get my ready every time I want to have an argument
[2091.74 → 2093.98] I don't know you guys don't have yours ready
[2093.98 → 2098.70] the only book I keep ready on mine is I just keep that one ready to go at all times but uh
[2098.70 → 2101.10] you're going to feel a gossiping father
[2101.10 → 2105.10] I just keep whenever I need some advice for the family this is what that helps me out
[2105.10 → 2106.70] this is not going on Spotify right
[2106.70 → 2107.10] josh
[2107.10 → 2109.10] censor that book please
[2109.10 → 2112.06] censor that book josh
[2112.06 → 2113.10] yes
[2113.10 → 2115.42] I'm just
[2115.42 → 2117.10] I'm getting ready for the next stage of my life
[2117.10 → 2119.10] oh my gosh
[2119.10 → 2119.58] yeah
[2119.58 → 2122.54] it was so funny you actually made the stream chat break
[2122.54 → 2125.98] sorry i have to get a new stream chat this thing breaks constantly
[2125.98 → 2131.90] that's amazing so what it is like what is chapter one of that book like how to put a pill into a drink
[2131.90 → 2137.50] what's the what's what's the start of fatherhood what's the Rico on that one
[2138.38 → 2139.90] okay a dramatic reading of father
[2139.90 → 2143.98] yeah chapter one is at some point your date will wake back up
[2145.02 → 2150.46] the the the opening chapter is called the baffling question I'll let you guys guess what it's about okay
[2150.46 → 2156.22] okay all right uh wait on the code review thing I will say I love the idea i kind of want to just
[2156.22 → 2162.14] join a new company just so I can be like my first code review I'm going to produce a YouTube video instead
[2162.14 → 2168.62] and just like can you do code review and right away it's just like trash look at this trash code
[2168.62 → 2173.82] this if statement what an idiot, and it's like stop uploading YouTube videos for the GitHub
[2173.82 → 2179.50] that I'll get fired right away, but it'll be funny we should companies should have prime go in and we
[2179.50 → 2184.70] can look at a terrible piece of code, and then they can tell us why it has to be that way that would
[2184.70 → 2190.38] actually be fun yeah yeah because there 's's always bad code and a lot of it was just like well
[2190.38 → 2195.98] you know we are under some pressure and things were this way and this one service wasn't quite right so
[2195.98 → 2202.70] we had to, or it's uh, or it's like we've refactored it three times, and we got back to the same code
[2202.70 → 2208.62] every time we started we did a refactor, and then it was the same exact piece of code so we deleted the
[2208.62 → 2216.46] we deleted that branch and moved on next year's new recruits they tried the same thing they all died
[2216.46 → 2222.38] right here here 's's the here let me give an analogy for any really like new programmers
[2222.38 → 2227.90] out there who are watching this if you've ever watched a professional baseball game
[2228.46 → 2232.62] right if you know anything about baseball at all, or you played little league or whatever
[2233.66 → 2241.66] so if you are in little league, and they're teaching you how to hit they're going to be like okay you
[2241.66 → 2245.90] you know you put your back foot here in the batter's box put your front foot out, and you're
[2245.90 → 2249.74] going to put your weight like this you're going to hold the bat like this right you're going to step
[2249.74 → 2253.58] forward, and you're going to you know do this thing and all that they're they're coaching you on all
[2253.58 → 2262.30] this stuff and keep your head down right that's what people tell you about code review or what they
[2262.30 → 2268.54] do in a code review you watch an actual major league hitter and the instructions would be like okay first
[2268.54 → 2273.66] you take your batting gloves off like 67 times and put them back on then you like you know make the sign
[2273.66 → 2279.34] of the cross and like adjust the gold chain or whatever then you like to do some crazy thing like
[2279.34 → 2284.94] like like like hold the bat way the hell up here, and then you like corkscrew it around and then but
[2284.94 → 2290.38] finally you sort of get back into a real actual swing, and you hit a home run right, and you win the
[2290.38 → 2296.62] freaking game, and you're an amazing batter right the same exact thing is true of coding all the crap that
[2296.62 → 2303.42] they tell you about all this stuff then you go look at some coder who's like absolutely bonkers crazy
[2303.42 → 2309.50] amazing and like wrote like tom the inner loop like not tom like a perfect programmer, and it's like
[2309.50 → 2315.18] you look, and it's like all the variable names are like one letter right it's just like they have what
[2315.18 → 2321.18] they got into and the way that they code, and they're perfect at it, and it's not the pristine thing
[2321.18 → 2327.02] that's the best you know practices advice that's just that's the reality of if it's exactly like major
[2327.02 → 2333.26] league baseball right it just it doesn't work the instructional way so it's okay like those things
[2333.26 → 2339.50] are always sort of general guidelines that we're trying to push you towards more readable more
[2339.50 → 2346.22] maintainable code, but the reality of programming is dirtier than that that's just how it is uh so it's
[2346.22 → 2350.30] okay well there's a divide I see this on the internet all the time it's always it's a lot of times people
[2350.30 → 2355.66] who are like haven't had their job yet that's usually, and they're excited they love code they're trying
[2355.66 → 2359.90] to get smart sometimes they're in school sometimes they're just YouTube fiends and they're just like
[2359.90 → 2364.78] why wouldn't you just take the extra time to make the code perfect why wouldn't you just always make
[2364.78 → 2369.42] it right, and it's like okay they're called deadlines they're called managers it's all a lot of factors
[2369.42 → 2373.82] that will never ever let you do that in the real world, but you just don't know until you get a job
[2373.82 → 2378.70] and then you get a job and four years later you're a different person, and you laugh at those kids and
[2378.70 → 2384.38] then the next new crop comes up, and it happens again it's its never anything I'll tell you i can literally
[2384.38 → 2391.66] tell you so the like Jeff Roberts the guy who ran rad game tools easily one of the best programmers ever
[2392.22 → 2398.54] all the code is basically just like that it's like a bunch of like every variable is one letter
[2398.54 → 2403.98] it's all just kind of like lined up like it's its not that easy to read this code, and you'd be like
[2403.98 → 2408.22] that's ridiculous how can anyone work with code like that it's insane like how do you maintain it how
[2408.22 → 2416.62] do you go back and read it he wrote the compression algorithms for one of the products that i did
[2416.62 → 2422.94] basically all the other code for he gave it to me sorry what is it called no it's it was granny the
[2422.94 → 2430.06] 3d animation system okay it had a compressor built in, and he gave me that code he gave me that code uh when
[2430.06 → 2437.90] he finished making it is went into the project my project there was never a bug ever in the entire not
[2437.90 → 2446.30] once i never had to even open those files that's just how good it is he just gives you this like here's
[2446.30 → 2451.58] a complete compressor i wrote for scratch completely for your project and only your project I've only ever
[2451.58 → 2458.06] done my coding and my testing on it is shipped to customers never broke once in the entire time i mean that
[2458.06 → 2466.22] for five years i maintained that project, and it never broke once so it's just like the reality is
[2466.22 → 2472.78] sometimes people are just very, very good at doing code the way they do it and if they get the results
[2472.78 → 2479.74] that's fine don't you know then at the same time you get j diesel or something right the system worked
[2479.74 → 2485.58] Casey if everyone would just follow along it was fine until j came along yeah just because at runtime when
[2485.58 → 2488.86] a customer wants to change information you have to do a SVN lookup to find out the function does
[2488.86 → 2495.02] not mean it wasn't perfect tortoise oh we know our code is always matching our actual committed code
[2495.02 → 2502.62] oh no that's integrity yeah, yeah anyway, or it's one TJ on your story about rewriting it yeah i know
[2502.62 → 2506.70] I've told the story once before but when i was working on falcon there was a piece of requesting
[2507.26 → 2511.26] that really bothered me because i was like dude this code's ugly and this was still during my time when
[2511.26 → 2515.74] i thought i could just write really great code all the time and so during this like hey this code is
[2515.74 → 2521.42] ugly phase uh for requesting so it was a data fetcher in JavaScript that would try to match what's
[2521.42 → 2526.78] already on the TV and then what's like the minimum amount of data it needs to request next so that way
[2526.78 → 2531.34] all the things doing like all the components being like hey i need to display these 20 titles it goes
[2531.34 → 2535.10] okay i already have 17 of the titles I'm going to make a request for the remaining three right so it was a
[2535.10 → 2540.70] pretty clever piece of array manipulation is all it was, and so i do this whole like
[2540.70 → 2544.54] rewrite of the requesting because I'm like this is bad and at first I'm like dude look how much better
[2544.54 → 2549.10] mine is already the code's way more readable it's all this kind of things and then I'm like oh crap
[2549.10 → 2552.62] i forgot this one case and so than i added in this next case I'm like okay it's like a little bit closer
[2552.62 → 2556.86] but still it's way more readable and like oh crap i forgot this one case and by the time i all
[2556.86 → 2562.38] crapped i forgot this one case at the end it was almost a line for line rewrite of exactly what
[2562.38 → 2574.06] and then that's when i realized I'm the problem no that's when you realized i was so smart before
[2574.06 → 2579.18] and I'm still really smart you got the wrong conclusion from that prime yeah yeah yeah all
[2579.18 → 2583.02] right and then of course since we're kind of talking about this and people coding this has
[2583.02 → 2587.66] been my favourite tweet for the last couple of weeks or the last week i just keep thinking about it over
[2587.66 → 2592.22] and over and over again the inner tweet goes like this just found out this all right just found
[2592.22 → 2598.86] out that since this I've become a top 50 user Devin globally pushing 60 TRS a day ask me anything
[2599.50 → 2604.62] now remember uh Devin if you don't know it's like this kind of like uh it's like an interesting update
[2605.42 → 2613.02] interesting update that's pretty interesting hunter an interesting update the team is starting to move
[2613.02 → 2618.30] away from AI coding completely Devin Claude because it's so much harder to review the AI code than writing
[2618.30 → 2624.86] things themselves it's like my it's its my favourite if it is my favourite it's just so funny
[2624.86 → 2631.34] to be like dude I'm pushing 60 PRS a day actually my team kind of got upset it was like how it started
[2631.34 → 2637.90] how it's going that was the perfect like self self-created one of those the funny thing too is
[2637.90 → 2643.10] that's exactly the amount of time they said before software engineering is dead they're like oh six months
[2643.10 → 2647.82] from now we're not going to have software developer jobs, and they're like we actually deleted all
[2647.82 → 2655.18] the stuff we tried when we said that this definitely ends up like South Park where it's like they're
[2655.18 → 2659.50] like oh my god he's pushing 60 PRS a day it's too much i just have to use AI to review it but i can't
[2659.50 → 2664.06] tell him, and then he's over there using AI and both of them are just like oh my god i hate this we're
[2664.06 → 2670.54] both just AI each other, and we're not telling each other yeah all right well there you go so Casey how
[2670.54 → 2677.74] do you feel you've learned the story of tom how was it i mean this is the thing right like
[2680.06 → 2688.38] we've all been there we've all we've all been j diesel and here's the thing i just feel fortunate
[2689.02 → 2697.98] that for that my j diesel phase the worst thing that happened was that build utility right i never
[2698.94 → 2707.90] shipped anything quite so horrible as the entire company's customer database is now running externally
[2707.90 → 2715.50] on this disaster thing that i made right uh so i feel like it's definitely it's there but for the
[2715.50 → 2721.26] grace of god go i think is the phrase that people often use for something like this it's like you're
[2721.26 → 2728.54] going to have some phase in your programming career where you just go down a rathole or rabbit hole
[2728.54 → 2732.78] i guess as people more commonly called I've always called it a rathole, or you know i guess i grew up
[2732.78 → 2737.74] maybe Massachusetts it's a rathole we have more rats than rabbits i don't know what's going on over
[2737.74 → 2744.46] there more rats than rabbits um so you know you go down this thing, and you get this wild hair, and you're
[2744.46 → 2749.26] like this is going to be awesome I'm so smart, but you just don't have the experience to realize that
[2749.26 → 2756.22] you're really actually being pretty stupid it happens to everybody at some point some people
[2756.22 → 2762.70] like tom are too much of a genius to ever pull out of it so they just stay that way and become head of
[2762.70 → 2769.74] of engineering and their companies like engineering is terminally screwed um but yeah like the rest of us
[2769.74 → 2775.58] like it's just you hope you get out of that phase before anyone really does start relying on like before
[2775.58 → 2780.06] you hope you don't end up in a situation where there's nobody smarter around you to like go oh
[2780.06 → 2786.78] that's nice Casey like uh just let's not do that, and then you know in a year or two you've gotten
[2786.78 → 2792.46] better, and you know better right uh so I'm just fortunate i never did anything quite so terrible i guess
[2792.46 → 2797.50] is what i would say uh but i came close yeah you know there's something very funny about that which is that
[2797.50 → 2805.98] uh we all get the chance to do that in some at some capacity yeah but having people tell you're
[2805.98 → 2810.62] a programming virtuoso would reinforce the cycle of what you're doing is actually the correct thing
[2810.62 → 2815.34] like you could actually you could go your whole life thinking you're doing the right thing exactly and
[2815.98 → 2823.98] it's just because programming is such a complicated endeavour without a lot of like hard metrics like
[2823.98 → 2832.86] you know in one sense i do think if i can poke Tom's genius balloon with a pin just a little
[2832.86 → 2840.38] bit once you're at the point where it takes two days to check out your freaking customer database
[2840.38 → 2845.02] that's a good hard metric telling you that you're actually an idiot not a genius right, so there was a
[2845.02 → 2851.02] hard metric here that someone should have actually latched on to at some point but a lot of times you
[2851.02 → 2856.70] don't actually have a hard metric like a lot of times you can get pretty far with something where
[2856.70 → 2861.82] you're kind of ignoring the red flags like you know for what you're like in that relationship where
[2861.82 → 2866.70] it's like it's been going on for a while and there are definitely some red flags, but it's not like you know
[2867.34 → 2873.18] it's not obvious enough to you yet because you're still wrapped up in it or whatever so I do think there
[2873.18 → 2877.90] is a real danger of that because a lot of times there just isn't an obvious thing you can point to that's
[2877.90 → 2885.42] the clear sign that you're wrong um, and it can go on for a very long time I will say uh one thing
[2885.42 → 2889.82] that it is I really suggest everyone in their life hopefully they have someone who they only talk to
[2889.82 → 2895.42] once a year about coding and so then when you come back they get to say okay what trend are you on now
[2895.42 → 2900.46] I just got it I just got to experience at uh Thanksgiving my uncle is like an old c programmer
[2900.46 → 2904.38] so for a decade he's been hearing me about what I'm excited about once a year at Christmas
[2904.38 → 2909.98] and he started just roasting me throughout the history he was like oh yeah remember when you were
[2909.98 → 2915.42] saying everything's going to be a function no more microservices' oh yeah how'd that go for you
[2915.42 → 2919.66] hey remember when you said memory's just going to keep getting cheaper ruby's going to scale
[2919.66 → 2924.54] remember that phase, and he just like see he roasted me for a decade of everything and I was like oh i
[2924.54 → 2929.26] forgot about each of those because I'm on to the next one already I'm a genius I'm on I'm
[2929.26 → 2934.78] an elixir a stack now it's going to scale to the moon OTP don't worry about it, I guys I have a
[2934.78 → 2945.50] billion dollar idea okay here it is you ready for this yeah code therapist it's not a mentor not a life
[2945.50 → 2953.18] coach not a not programming courses none of that it's a therapist you go to this person for an hour a week
[2953.74 → 2958.78] right obviously we'll drive it by AI won't actually have humans involved because it's got to be a billion
[2958.78 → 2966.70] got to be big VC money yeah and what you do is you talk about the code, and they ask you they're like
[2967.26 → 2972.30] so tell me about your build environment right, and they're like you start talking about it and then
[2972.30 → 2977.74] they kind of ask you those questions, and they help you get in touch with like your inner like how
[2977.74 → 2984.54] you're actually relating to this code and whether you are starting to evince pathologies like tom right
[2984.54 → 2992.06] like and there could be like a DSM equivalent that basically has like here are the neuroses
[2992.06 → 2997.82] that you may have and they try to like help you uncover those right tell me about tell me
[2997.82 → 3003.26] about your code review tell me about this i I feel like this could be a thing I like this Casey I like
[3003.26 → 3008.54] this a lot I'm I'm in full support of it I think they called scrub masters though yeah they're called
[3008.54 → 3014.38] they're called scrum masters that's literally I think it's called hr is that not what hr is
[3014.94 → 3019.50] you're in there every week vegan lots of they love my jokes yeah they always ask to hear
[3019.50 → 3025.58] code therapy though code therapy sounds so funny yeah oh my gosh I want to do it with
[3025.58 → 3032.22] somebody like do you did like how did that variable name make you feel okay call prime call dr k and say
[3032.22 → 3036.62] I want to be a code therapist teach me how to be a code therapist and then we can have you just give
[3036.62 → 3041.66] therapy to someone on stream and he can be on stream watching you and giving you advice on how
[3041.66 → 3046.86] to therapy the person that's that's got to be that's ethical that's fine yeah that is ethical
[3046.86 → 3052.70] that's the word I was going to use i have to I got an another stupid true story for you here i just to
[3052.70 → 3059.90] show you how much I don't understand anything i uh like a couple of years back I got an email from somebody
[3059.90 → 3065.98] who was like I knew through it was like a childhood friend's sister or something like you know
[3065.98 → 3069.74] who i I know who they are it wasn't like weird that they would email me, but it's like not someone
[3069.74 → 3077.18] I ever emailed with, and they were like hey I was wondering like I have a friend who recently got laid
[3077.18 → 3084.06] off in the like in tech and I was wondering if like maybe you could help them like find a new job
[3084.06 → 3090.78] somewhere right I know you're out there in uh in the Seattle area right and I know you do like a lot of
[3090.78 → 3095.90] programming stuff, and you're well known and all this stuff so you know in their mind that means
[3095.90 → 3100.22] that you like i I assume that means that they think you like hang out with all the managerial
[3100.22 → 3105.66] people or whatever so they're like so I'm like uh who like what is the what's the thing, and they're
[3105.66 → 3109.50] like well this that they're uh they're a certified scrum master
[3109.50 → 3119.42] and I'm like I'm like I don't know what that is like do they know anything like do they know
[3119.42 → 3125.10] anything that does something like I'm like can they progress they do anything like no they're just
[3125.10 → 3129.82] a certified scrum master and I'm just like I was like I can't help you like I mean the only people i
[3129.82 → 3134.14] hang out with program for a living like I don't know I don't even know what a certified scrum master
[3134.14 → 3139.74] is I don't even know what I don't even know how you would certify someone to do that thing because
[3139.74 → 3144.54] the only thing I know about it is that some people just stand around and talk for like 15 minutes so
[3145.18 → 3149.50] do you guys want to tell me what that would mean how do you get certified to be a scrum master
[3150.30 → 3156.62] what is this what is a scrum master have you heard of the game no I mean so Casey the main way
[3156.62 → 3163.66] is they have to like and subscribe on this podcast okay, okay I was going to say remember chat everyone if you
[3163.66 → 3167.50] do someone says they're a scrum master I do this every time you can save a lot of harder this way
[3167.50 → 3172.22] ask for their credentials they say they're certified say I want to see the certification what's your badge
[3172.22 → 3179.50] number like there's a lot of fakes out there all right and i will not take a ticket from
[3179.50 → 3183.74] anyone unless I see their certification that's just how I operate okay because they could just be
[3183.74 → 3189.50] impersonating a scrum master they could be it's a big problem it could be a scrum novice felony but it
[3189.50 → 3195.98] still happens I mean that's the that is the scary world we live in so what does the scrum master do
[3195.98 → 3201.82] guys like what do they what does that mean just a second vegan by the way you don't have any like uh
[3201.82 → 3207.74] what's it called like filter on your microphone so this whole time I can oh, oh sorry chat like
[3207.74 → 3212.06] it's ASMR do it deeply and I can't someone made a comment about it now I can't stop hearing you
[3212.06 → 3217.74] breathe it took you an hour to decide to tell them yeah, thanks for telling me now I did an audio test
[3217.74 → 3221.02] before this and listen to myself breathe for a while and I was like that's kind of pleasant
[3224.06 → 3229.74] guys I will not breathe any more okay yeah we were reminding chat they I know they were holding their
[3229.74 → 3235.26] breath during the story, but it's a subliminal thing to remind them to breathe during the story of Jake and
[3235.26 → 3241.42] tom chat I'm doing the Kazan day from now on it doesn't work because my mic goes with me but okay
[3241.42 → 3247.42] we'll figure this out chat I'll mute um all right so uh to explain the scrum master so I've I've worked
[3247.42 → 3251.98] with a certified scrum master on many levels and in fact was so scrum mastery that they actually
[3251.98 → 3257.90] went out and taught other scrum masters how to scrum master okay so I clearly asked the right person
[3257.90 → 3265.74] because not only can you tell me the truth straight from a scrum master but from a scrum master
[3265.74 → 3273.90] master exactly okay um okay so I'm not going to say any names just so I don't get anybody in
[3273.90 → 3278.94] trouble but the rest of this podcast has been that way yeah I know so well except for the part
[3278.94 → 3286.06] where you're talking about the functions everybody knew the name guys I was trying not to create drama
[3286.06 → 3291.74] I intentionally didn't talk about this thing drama Casey you were good oh no, no there's definitely videos
[3291.74 → 3296.22] being made right now I'm sorry it's already happening Casey it's he doesn't even know what
[3296.22 → 3302.54] a school master is okay so yeah and that's a true story, so this is I'm gonna just I'm going to tell you
[3302.54 → 3307.58] my definition of a scrum master this is not the official definition of a scrum master this is what i
[3307.58 → 3313.10] believe one to be after working with one of the pinnacle scrum masters out there okay which is the
[3313.10 → 3322.46] following that a scrum master is closer to a team therapist slash technical manager than anything
[3322.46 → 3327.66] else so a meet with people to make sure everyone's working together well make sure things
[3327.66 → 3332.70] are actually moving making sure that we're sizing our tasks correctly kind of keeping up to date that
[3332.70 → 3341.58] our team is adhering to agile principles in a very like sound way sound uh way and then b they also help
[3341.58 → 3345.10] a lot with a lot of the technical direction they're not technically technical managers they're not
[3345.10 → 3349.02] the ones that's supposed to be making all the tickets and doing things, but they often fall into this role
[3349.34 → 3354.70] and that was my experience was just like yeah but like how do you feel like I got a lot of that
[3354.70 → 3361.66] and so it truly was this code this this this mentor person this is kind of how I experienced actually you
[3361.66 → 3366.94] when you said they're called scrum masters you weren't even really joking like you actually that's
[3366.94 → 3372.30] kind of what they kind of have to do a little bit if they're good if they're good if you had a manager
[3372.86 → 3378.86] that was aloof a scrum manager like how i kind of took it is that this the scrub master is kind of like
[3379.50 → 3383.58] it's what the manager should do to all of his employees which is like check in and make sure
[3383.58 → 3388.86] everyone's doing okay and that we're not running off the rails but instead of the manager that I worked
[3388.86 → 3393.34] with was uh he would often just like rewrite part of our app over the weekend and was just always on
[3393.34 → 3398.30] just coding benders, and they were always crazy, and sometimes they caused so much conflict that i I've
[3398.30 → 3403.82] had to delete like a week's worth of work wow just because and then one time he got super jacked up
[3403.82 → 3408.30] on promises, but he like inclined his promises so I followed his pattern because i I didn't know what
[3408.30 → 3412.54] promises were this was like 2011 so I was like had like then and next functions that I was doing it
[3412.54 → 3415.66] was crazy because he was just like this is what we're doing we're doing promises so I was like all
[3415.66 → 3420.86] right we're doing promises everybody it was jacked up on promises dude I got jacked up on mountain
[3420.86 → 3425.66] doing promises and said what the hell were you doing I was like I don't know I'm just following
[3425.66 → 3431.66] what my boss told me to do I had kind of a rough childhood my dad used to come home late at night
[3431.66 → 3441.10] all jacked up on promises it's like then and next he's like why are my kids never asynchronous you know
[3441.10 → 3447.10] it's just it's just they're not even true threads
[3451.10 → 3453.90] dad you never love both of us it's always one of us at a time why can't
[3453.90 → 3463.98] also I know we're definitely in the uh random portion of the podcast right now but I do have
[3463.98 → 3468.62] to describe something happened yesterday because I spent yesterday serving coffee and telling people
[3468.62 → 3476.30] about ashing into an uh coffee website for armies for a seven hours straight uh I will say um can I
[3476.30 → 3482.22] share the picture with the girl that's you have to share the picture chat well do we have people's
[3482.22 → 3486.54] permission to share their picture you can show it on street they're all content creators everyone
[3486.54 → 3491.42] okay fair enough just making sure just okay so technically I wasn't there okay so prime's gonna show
[3491.42 → 3496.14] us guys this is an actual photo from yesterday this is 100 real you're never going to believe me but
[3496.14 → 3501.26] we have multiple witnesses what massage or terminal chat this terminal chat so basically what you're
[3501.26 → 3505.98] saying is this was AI generated it's not what you're basically telling me whatever I'm about
[3505.98 → 3510.62] to see which I don't actually know what it is my favourite picture in the universe I can't believe so
[3510.62 → 3518.06] this is at guys this is a real photo of me showing people ordering coffee in a terminal I swear to that's
[3518.06 → 3523.58] what's on the screen I am literally I'm holding the last and I go okay ladies watch this so first you all have
[3523.58 → 3529.26] max open terminal hit command space bar type t you got a terminal you'll see it right there press enter
[3529.26 → 3535.98] ssh terminal.shop boom there and I showed him and that was actually taken from that moment that is
[3535.98 → 3543.10] real I promise you this will never happen again this is the first one I have a question wild women with
[3543.10 → 3549.34] ssh skills literally happened like it arch boys be careful that was by the end of the day so i
[3549.34 → 3552.70] practiced the pitch 40 times because in the beginning you're like so how do you buy the coffee oh you
[3552.70 → 3560.70] guys can't okay i have to work better on this i have to get like this is not working so by the end I had a
[3560.70 → 3565.82] doubt I was showing him you can't but I'll teach you show you all have also you all have max and holding
[3565.82 → 3569.90] a mac was working really well they were like of course we do and I said this app's already on your
[3569.90 → 3573.74] computer they go it really is I go it really is right now and
[3576.46 → 3585.18] yes Casey so since everyone else got to plug all of their stuff uh i kind of want to do an extended
[3585.18 → 3592.22] plug for terminal.shop here uh because i I legitimately have a question about it okay which is
[3592.22 → 3600.14] at least I am a lousy business person, so maybe that is the answer to the question that I'm about
[3600.14 → 3608.94] to ask but in my mind when I hear like you can just order something from the terminal I'm like you guys
[3608.94 → 3613.66] are going to be rich I'm just like you're like that's going to be so freaking cool because two
[3613.66 → 3620.70] reasons one it's super novel and you people would tell each other that and two the only people in the
[3620.70 → 3626.46] world who have any money anymore are people who do use terminals because they freaking stole all the
[3626.46 → 3632.38] money, and they have all the money now so my assumption is that this would be the perfect
[3632.38 → 3637.74] business thing but for some reason I don't get the sense that you guys are now the world's number
[3637.74 → 3643.90] one coffee supplier so what why do you suck at marketing well there's my there's my actual question
[3643.90 → 3649.10] what is wrong with you crazy did you just see we're on the streets going one at a time with people
[3649.10 → 3655.18] here's the key we do not want to have losers drinking our coffee we're starting with top
[3655.18 → 3659.82] quality people who are the coolest people in the world who run the world programmers obviously start
[3659.82 → 3665.50] with the coolest people programmers after we get programmers then we'll start individually selecting
[3665.50 → 3670.06] other people in and then after that we'll go Starbucks, but you got to have a cool base of people
[3670.06 → 3675.26] like every programmer I know drinks this coffee what is it you can't have it we do that for four or five
[3675.26 → 3680.94] years okay people are like I want it so bad and goes you're too dumb then we sell it to them after
[3680.94 → 3684.86] we sell a big portion to some sort of like private equity firm you know black rock or something like
[3684.86 → 3688.62] that so I see so basically what you're saying is you're doing like the Facebook model it's like oh
[3688.62 → 3694.30] you wanted to be on this you can't be on it yet like it's right only invite for this coffee I see
[3694.86 → 3698.22] no but really like what's going on guys like what's going on what's wrong with I'll give you
[3698.22 → 3703.50] you got the real answer i do real answer what's the real answer the real answer even though
[3703.50 → 3710.30] it's going to sound like in another ad is just we'd rather ship like small batch coffee that's really
[3710.94 → 3715.10] good which is just hard to ship to a lot of people and like to a lot of places
[3715.10 → 3720.14] like supply constrained basically yes we can, we're not in any other place but the US even though I know
[3720.14 → 3726.62] Europe would go hard yep you know we have to be careful about stuff right so that's I mean that's the main
[3726.62 → 3731.90] the main thing I mean maybe over the next year we have uh we have started working a lot more on the
[3731.90 → 3737.66] on the coffee side of stuff in the past like three months probably and being a bit more uh a bit more
[3737.66 → 3744.46] serious about it but yeah I mean that's like the major is just like I don't know how to get a
[3744.46 → 3755.74] roaster in the EU that wants to interface with a custom like sass b2b slash b2c coffee experience where we
[3755.74 → 3762.06] like ship them addresses, and then you know so it's like that's the're so we're getting there but
[3762.06 → 3765.74] that's honestly like we figured out something part of it yeah we figured out something pretty dark which
[3765.74 → 3771.90] is apparently uh taking people's public keys is against GDP so we have a big issue to get around
[3771.90 → 3775.90] so whatever I said Gd GDPR whatever glp1
[3775.90 → 3782.06] we all know what it is you can't just throw an l of that one glp1 I like that
[3783.02 → 3786.62] but once we get the legislation once the legislation's changed we're going to be rich in Europe okay
[3786.62 → 3791.90] let's just yeah yeah yeah we're currently lobbying the EU, and then we're going to sell all the
[3791.90 → 3797.34] public keys to BlackRock like that is the ultimate dude chat checkmate I'm so excited if you guys
[3797.34 → 3802.70] didn't see when when uh the coffee first went live in hacker news it was like number one in
[3802.70 → 3806.30] hacker news that was one of the comments when someone's like why are they collecting the public
[3806.30 → 3811.34] keys they're just you're just giving them your public keys for free everyone idiots don't you know
[3811.34 → 3816.94] the plan they're harvesting public keys which we all got together and said who can we sell these to
[3818.22 → 3824.38] apparently there's a buyer out there i got in the dark web i could find no one we were so confused
[3824.38 → 3830.46] because we were trying to figure out is there something you can do with these i thought for sure there's
[3830.46 → 3838.06] nothing you can do with the public key of an ssh key pair I'm like i don't understand isn't that
[3838.06 → 3843.50] kind of why we call it the public key is because the public is supposed to be able to have it
[3844.06 → 3846.46] but it was like we're just so ready
